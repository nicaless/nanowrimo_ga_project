Settling into a new home isn't easy when you know what you're doing, but when you've just escaped the horrors of post-Wold War II Germany, it is an incredible challenge.</p>\\n<p>Here in Fortunato they will find peace and stability. They will learn Spanish. They will find work, they will find friendship, and they will become the family that their paperwork claims they already are.</p>\\n\", \"\\n<p>It's every writer's dream - an all-expense paid writer's residency. Eight lucky writers are accepted to the residency of their dreams: 7 days of peace and inspirational solitude in the Maine woods.</p><p>Between the day they arrive and the final celebratory banquet, much will change in the lives of the eight chosen residents.

All he wants to do is make some money so he can get out of Fortunato and head to the capital city of Santiago.<br/>He'll work the oddest of odd jobs to reach his goal; whether it's as a security guard at the town's only bank, to trying his hand at milk delivery in one of Fortunato's least accessible hillside neighborhoods.<br/>Along the way he'll dodge his mother's attempts at matchmaking and he'll try to connect with his much younger sister Elena, who, unlike her brother and parents was born in Chile and knows nothing of the family's previous life in pre-war Russia. <br/></p>\\n\", '\\n<p>Andre Levinsky is a celebrated writer in his native Chile, that is until his most recent novel, Perdido, crashes and burns at the same time as his marriage. With his wife and two children gone,  and his career in shambles, Andre decides it is time to start over.<br/>He orchestrates his own disappearance, several years before disappearances will become commonplace and deadly in South America, and flees to Argentina where he reinvents himself as a quiet bookseller named Abe Lewin. He befriends Rey Vega and his younger sister Carolina, becomes the general manager at Monsivais y Hnos. booksellers and manages, for a while at least, to keep his secrets and evade discovery.<br/>Everything seems to be working out for him.

After listening to some of the stories people report about their experiences that result from the odd routings, she decides to let the app lead her through a route that helps her reconnect with something important from her past that she hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realized she had been missing (prerequisite).

The diegetic term <em>pirate</em> became a catch-all for commercial crime in space (raiding, smuggling, illegal broadcasting and so-on), but between low profits driving small-ship commerce to less-legal revenue generation, and law-enforcement cracking down needlessly on procedural missteps (usually so they could be bribed), it eventually became impossible to operate a small commercial ship without doing something criminal, and the term pirate became synonymous with a small commercial ship and its crew (albeit a disparaging term). <em>Space Pirates</em> features the gritty underbelly of the Federation (and the fleet) involving shady deals, rampant double-crosses, fighting The Man and fabulous (highly illegal and questionably ethical) contraband.

I don\\'t use any specific terms such as <em>phasers</em>, <em>tricorders</em>, <em>warp core</em> (there is a <em>power</em> core, though) and so on.* At this point, much of my diegetic elements are quite removed from their Trek-expy origins.<br/><br/>* Interestingly, warp drive or bending space is the going hypothesis as to how long distance travel would work as per the <em>Alcubierre metric</em> (by scrunching space before travelling through it, and then letting it unfurl afterwards, so that local speed never exceeds speed-of-light, or even comfortable levels of time dilation, for that matter).<br/><br/><strong>Game Title ideas:</strong><br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Fleet and Federation</em> (play on the phrase <em>King and Country</em>, also nodding to the <em>D&amp;D;</em> style RPG naming convention of the \\'70s)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Pioneers of the Future</em> (based on NASA\\'s mission statement, 2006 <em>[to] pioneer the future in space exploration...</em>)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Pioneers of Tomorrow</em> (as immediately above, <em>Tomorrow</em> is a more raygun gothic term than <em>The Future</em>, as per Disney\\'s <em>Tomorrowland</em>*)<br/><strong>Rejected names</strong><br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Trek!</em> (Working title. Would rile Paramount\\'s lawyers)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Free Enterprise</em> (taken by a movie about trekkies pestering William Shatner. Seriously! And a sequel\\'s in the works!)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Stars in SPACE!</em> (Too plain, and payoff of the double meaning was wasted).<br/><br/>Anyhow, I\\'m open to, and in need of name ideas, specifically ones that might indicate a fleet-based <i>Wagon Train</i> to the stars, planet-of-hats milieu, yet won\\'t work Paramount\\'s lawyers into a froth.<br/><br/>* Disney is even considering <em>The Future</em> is a bit zeerusty a concept, so that Disneyland Paris features <em>Discoveryland</em> which features more steampunk and clockworkpunk themes hoping they will age better than futurological projections that need to be regularly replaced.<br/><br/>More later...<br/><em>last update: Tuesday, November 08, 2011 5:11:08 PM</em></p>\\n', \"\\n<p>This Nano, I've given myself permission to world-hop.

The protagonist intends to send them, but somehow he simply knows it\\'s wrong (for a variety of reasons), or just can\\'t. <br/><br/>He writes as if to a muse, to a true confessor, and his letters become a reflection on his life and the existential dilemmas he finds himself trapped in (a la Camus\\'s \"The Fall\"). The more he writes, though, the more the reader must question his reliability as a narrator. Is he a true lover, obsessed, a mad man, or all three? Has he mythologized and rehashed his memories to the point that their reality is questionable? And then there\\'s the question of whether he\\'ll send the letters, what will happen if he does, or if the letters will be discovered by another?<br/><br/>It\\'s a heady task, but I\\'d like this novel to trace the themes of Roland Barthes\\' \"A Lover\\'s Discourse.\" We\\'ll see....</p>\\n', \"\\n<p>Festus, a 16-year-old boy is deeply immersed in the novels of Jacques Steinberg, a YA fantasy author who spins labyrinthian tales that involve layers of texts, maps, and drawings.

He takes the little money he has and goes on an Odyssey in search of Jacques Steinberg, who is convinced can solve all of his problems. It's not so easy to find Steinberg, or travel across states to get to his home.

I was born and raised in the same town as both my parents, and my grandparents were either born there as well or within a 30 mile radius. I seriously have memories walking into the grocery store and not getting to the checkout counter for an hour. Why you ask? Not because it was overcrowded but because people like to talk. Small town people love to talk! Every time we went somewhere, we knew someone. No lie. Needless to say, everyone knowing your business got old for me, especially as a teenager. But the sweetness of growing up in such a place never goes away. From the genuine handwave you receive from the people driving by the house on their way home in the country, to the smell of the loblolly pines that stood in the State Park before the 2011 wildfire wiped them out, the town of Bastrop, Texas matters more to me now more than it ever has before.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were times I felt like a fish out of water, not just being in the town but even in my own family. I loved school and learning and was apparently better at gaining white friends than anything else. Being little Lacey was difficult. I was sensitive to negative things, and always wanted peace. That proved difficult, especially at home where chaos would erupt during what was supposed to be Sunday dinner at Granny\\'s house. School was my escape. My teachers were my role models, and I fought hard to not be a small-town-black-girl-who-thinks-she\\'s-better-than-everyone-else-and-talks-white. At times, I felt like I lived a double life, and it was terrifying. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned a lot in my hometown. As a teenager, I played volleyball from the age of 12 until I graduated from Bastrop High School and threw myself into the world of being a teen in a small town. I must say, it is something everyone should experience at 16. When you are used to dirt roads and one, maybe two stop lights on the main highway through the town, you must get creative with how you spend your time. So that\\'s what we did. In middle school (because it\\'s wasn\\'t called \"junior high\" in Bastrop), if I wasn\\'t at volleyball practice or a game, I was walking the neighborhood with friends. One of my best friends, Heather, who you will hear more about later, lived about a 10-15 minute walk from me, and we would meet halfway and decide whose house to camp out at for the evening. My cousins, extended cousins, and cousins who were really cousins but you grew up with them like they were cousins would come over every single day during the summers to hang out. Our house was always where people ended up. My mom loved it! It was a much needed change for me and my siblings after living in the country. By the time high school rolled around, I was beginning to figure some things out about myself. I had started to go to church pretty regularly by the age of 12 (as a kid we mostly went on Easter and Christmas and occasionally we would attend a family member\\'s funeral), so as a teenager, I was considered a bonafide Jesus Freak. Yes, yes that\\'s right. Ok, well, maybe not bonafide (yet), but attending church and attempting to read the King James Bible was a serious priority. Don\\'t judge! I continued to play and excel at volleyball, joined Student Council, played clarinet in Wind Ensemble (only freshman year). Being in a relationship wasn\\'t really at the forefront of my mind, for many reasons, one being I knew I was gay and there was no way in hell I was going to come out of the closet. Instead I focused on my grades, sports, and friendships. I met my very best friend, Dallas Stobaugh (now Armstrong) my sophomore year! Thinking about this now makes me sound like I was a level-headed kid with no concerns. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\\'s a bold-face lie! </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior year. The \\xc2\\xa0Jesus lovin\\', all\\'s good in my world, intelligent, out-going, loving black girl fell apart. I lost it. At school. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I skipped class the entire day. I couldn\\'t get together. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn\\'t until I was 27 that I started to put together the pieces of me that were broken. 10 years later, I figured it out. That small town of Bastrop, Texas almost got the best of me. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost. And for that, I am grateful. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the exception of my brief stint at dorm life, every tear, every joy, every sorrowful and celebratory moment I had happened there until August 2015. My wife and I packed up our car and moved to California. Bastrop is the only place I know. From the religion and politics that built me up then shattered me to my grandmother\\'s homes that are an essential part of my childhood and also the cemetery where they were both laid to rest, the streets I roamed with my siblings and friends, and the school walls that kept me safe but also gave off this superficial aroma, reminding me constantly that I truly didn\\'t know who I was, to the pine trees. Oh, the pines. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bastrop is home. It will always be home. All the people mentioned here are a true part of me, good, bad, and darn ugly.

She lives an isolated childhood in a small town blighted by its association with a so-called monster who buys people's memories, the focus of an extremist group called STORM who decry it as immoral. After an explosion which destroys the Cliffs of Moher all but blocks off the path to the creature's residence, she meets Sim, a boy who was found in the sea after purportedly jumping from the clifftop.

Though angels watch over them, their steps are dogged by demons just waiting for a mistake. The only clue they have is one word: 'chaos'.

It involved my first experience of winning NaNoWriMo during the first week \\xe2\\x80\\x94 specifically, on day seven. It was also incredibly terrible, with numerous instances of head hopping and just poor writing, so I never bothered to edit it. Still, I was still fairly new to the writing game at that point. At 126k, it was also the longest novel I've written to date. Well, what do you expect when it spans a guy's entire life?<br/><br/>FIGUREHEAD<br/><br/>This marginally less disastrous novel followed the story of Alanna, the Queen in a futuristic England, who was determined to regain some of the power of her ancient predecessors. Although still not a great novel, and with various cameo appearances including Mr Ian Woon, it's the kind of thing that if I'm ever stuck for inspiration, I will go back and rewrite it. Maybe. Or at least, harvest some ideas.</p>\\n\", \"\\n<p>This was the first novel I ever completed.<br/><br/>I was no exception to the rule. It was completely terrible.

To be fair, I was only 13, and I had no idea what I was doing\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 But basically the novel was terrible.<br/><br/>It took clich\\xc3\\xa9d tropes to a whole new level, I'm not gonna lie. But, earlier this year (2013) I took the central concept of the novel and wrote an entirely new book with it. I think that just goes to prove that even the worst novels are sometimes worth writing.<br/><br/>And, because this was my first novel, it still remains the most important thing I ever wrote.

Yet when the British authorities pin him down and contract\\xc2\\xa0a single piece of writing\\xc2\\xa0that will permanently undermine American colonial interests\\xc2\\xa0and lionize British imperialism, Thomas does not refuse.
