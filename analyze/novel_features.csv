<p>Life is an adventure. Especially when you find out that you are actually a banshee.</p><p>15-year old Luna Gardener's life has been quite ordinary so far. She's student council president at her school, loves 1950s fashion and watches every ice hockey game with her single father. </p><p>Nothing in her life so far has ever suggested that she is anything but normal—until she starts screaming at her teacher out of the blue one day. Confused and worried, her teacher sends her home where, on the evening news, she finds out that her teacher died in a car accident on his way home. Two days later, her father yanks her out of bed in the middle of the night and tells her that they have to go on the run, that there are people after Luna and that her mother didn't die in a train accident like she thought all these years, but is alive and the only person who can help her daughter. </p><p>At a supermarket, where they gather supplies for their escape, they are attacked by a group of people who look like they just jumped out of a Men in Black movie. In the quarrel, Luna screams again and shortly after, her father gets shot to death. Luna is about to be captured by these when an Asian girl enters the scene, lets out a scream of her own and takes Luna with her to safety. That is when Luna finds out that she is not a normal human, like she always thought, but a predictor of death: a banshee. </p>

<p>In the year 2342 AD, scientists try to create one of the most famous fantastical beings in the history of mankind - dragons. They succeed at a terrible price. The creatures they created are soulless, ravaging monsters who kill every human they can find, and within just a few weeks more than 85% of the human population is eradicated, cities destroyed, the blue planet a wasteland. The beginning of these terrible times is known as Break Down After World, and every 1,000 years the calendars are reset to remember this day. <br/><br/>But hope is still strong, for the destruction by the dragonlike creatures that are henceforth known as Draconia is followed by the revelation of planet earth's real Dragons - kind, gentle and magical beings that can take on human forms. What is left of the human race divides into colonies - hiding from the Draconia - and the 25 bases around the world, a military organization set out to destroy the rapidly multiplying Draconia with help of the Dragons, which need human companions as switches in order to control their dragon fire while in dragon form, known as Dragon Riders. Two rider-and-dragon pairs serve each of the 25 bases respectively, protecting the people and looking for ways to end this reign of terror.<br/><br/>90,000 years later, a team from Base 9 discovers the in an iceberg off (what used to be known as) Greenland frozen sleeping body of a young woman. They manage to free her from her cold cage and revive her. Her name is Lily and she fell into her cryogenic sleep in the 21st century, 300 years before the creation of the Draconia. Not long after, Halían, a Dragon who hasn't found his Dragon Rider yet and has been forced to live in his human form for the last 900 years, is transferred from Base 16 to Base 9 (he's been switched around the bases every decade) to be watched over. When Lily and Halían finally touch one day, Halían's dragonstone cuffs break and free him from his human shape, making him able to take on his real form for the first time since he received his dragon fire on his 100th birthday, revealing Lily as his destined Dragon Rider. From now on, the pair serves Base 9 - which has been the only base with only one rider-and-dragon pair instead of two - along with Base 9's original pair, the Dragon Jar'esh and his rider Molly.<br/><br/>Their fight against the Draconia begins...</p>

This surely can’t take that much longer, can it?<br/><br/>Caught between a stubborn old woman, a best friend who doesn’t see her for who she is now, and a city she left on her eighteenth birthday, Hope snaps. The town may have underestimated Grandma, but Grandma has underestimated Hope.<br/><br/>She seizes legal control of Grandma’s assets in order to set everything straight. When Hope hires Ed, a contractor and an old classmate from high school, she only wants him to rebuild the house. When he also builds a relationship with her, she falls for him. Hard.<br/><br/>Hope doesn’t know what she wants anymore. She has to decide whether this love, despite the issues with her hometown and her old best friend, not to mention her grandmother, are worth giving up the life she left town for in the first place.</p>

<p>Abby Brewer just cut a deal with a talking frog.</p>
<p>He's retrieving her lucky soccer ball, which is floating away down the river, in exchange for a promise: she must help him become human again and get back to his fairy-tale kingdom.</p>
<p>Varsity tryouts begin today, and she's doomed without her ball. If she can't make the team, she can't get her dad off her case and can't get Jackson Foster to finally notice her.</p>
<p>All the frog needs is a kiss, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Attempting to turn Prince Brendan back into a human takes longer than either of them plans. It also attracts the attention of the sorceress who cast the spell over him. Abby's got to help Brendan before the witch finds them and transforms Abby into a frog, too.</p>
<p>Abby wants to get the whole thing over with and focus on her own life – namely Jackson. When she falls for Brendan, keeping her promise may be the hardest thing she's ever had to do. Besides outwitting a witch, of course.</p>

<p>A young computer programmer works for a startup that has an app that gives intelligent, up to the minute driving directions. She is put in charge of fixing a bug that has been sending drivers on weird, out of the way routes to their destinations. After listening to some of the stories people report about their experiences that result from the odd routings, she decides to let the app lead her through a route that helps her reconnect with something important from her past that she hadn’t realized she had been missing (prerequisite). Eventually, she comes to believe that something more spiritual has become enmeshed in the artificial intelligence engine that drives the wayfinding app, maybe a saint or the Virgin Mary, or God Himself (requirement). But when she shares her findings with others, she is laughed at, and worse, almost loses her job (costs) because of course, any discussion of the spiritual in context within the realm of science and technology is completely blown off by the establishment (preconditions). At first she decides to just keep things to herself, but the startup she works for is running out of money (forewarning), and she learns that if they don’t get more funding all operations are likely to be shuttered, including pulling the plug on the servers running the saintly AI (consequence). She decides that she will have to get others to believe in the AI saint as well, to get help saving the program from being unplugged (story goal). She meets a professor of computer science from India, who is the first person to believe her about the spiritual nature of the AI (prerequisite). Luckily, the AI saint itself is able to help her find a way to bring its messages to more people and build a following as well (dividend). As word starts to spread though, she finds herself in conflict with leaders of major world religious organizations, who want to either control her and the AI or undermine her credibility by telling people it is a fraud or the work of the devil (forewarnings / consequence).</p>
<p>From the beginning of the story, the young computer programmer never intended to be an entrepreneur herself, she just saw herself as a programmer, interested in the calming mental challenge of solving problems via code. She has to change this attitude and be willing to become a leader of the startup herself, setting an actual vision for how the app and its saintly AI will be made available to the public. After making this personal adjustment, she succeeds in getting enough backing to buy out the startup herself, via a crowdfunding campaign. She has a show-down with the original founders, the VC’s who provided the previous funding, and several religious leaders to wrest control of the technology owned by the startup.</p>

<p>I am editing the game I worked on last year <strong>which desperately needs a good title</strong>*, though at this point I'm liking the bennies of <em>Fleet &amp; Federation</em>, though can't completely commit to being sold on it. <em>F&amp;F;</em> It feels like the <em>Mortimer</em> before the <em>Mickey</em>; the <em>Bingo</em> before the <em>Frodo</em>.†<br/><br/>That said, I'm too deviant this year even to be regarded as a <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/forums/nano-rebels/threads/724"">NaNorebel</a>, more of a NaNo-satellite, though my fellow outside-the-boxers may debate the number of additional dimensions required to express the magnitude of my deviation. (Is it possible to think outside a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle"">Klein Bottle</a>?)<br/><br/>* Interestingly, the sequel (in the same diegesis) was much easier to name. The game <em>Space Pirates</em> was modeled on <em>Firefly</em> and <em>Serenity</em> as <em>F&amp;F;</em> is on <em>Star Trek</em> (both have an ensemble-based narrative). The diegetic term <em>pirate</em> became a catch-all for commercial crime in space (raiding, smuggling, illegal broadcasting and so-on), but between low profits driving small-ship commerce to less-legal revenue generation, and law-enforcement cracking down needlessly on procedural missteps (usually so they could be bribed), it eventually became impossible to operate a small commercial ship without doing something criminal, and the term pirate became synonymous with a small commercial ship and its crew (albeit a disparaging term). <em>Space Pirates</em> features the gritty underbelly of the Federation (and the fleet) involving shady deals, rampant double-crosses, fighting The Man and fabulous (highly illegal and questionably ethical) contraband. My far-reaching dream was to sell the design to Joss Whedon (or Fox) so that <em>Serenity</em> could fly again and <strong>you</strong> could be <strong>Malcom Reynolds!</strong><br/><br/>† Really. I kid you not. Bingo Baggins, but for an editor's recommendation. <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer"">I am not making this up.</a><br/><br/><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_concept"">High Concept</a> Premise:</strong> What if <em>Star Trek</em> was a reality show?<br/><br/><strong>Single Sentence Summary:</strong> Six young, idealistic fleet officers sign on to the Enterprise and what is the highest rated show in Federation media, only to discover it isn't as glamorous or as lofty as they imagined, or as is portrayed to the viewing public.<br/><br/><strong>Relevant details about the project:</strong><br/>~ It is an affectionate parody, though sometimes a deconstruction of <em>Star Trek: The Original Series</em><br/>~ It features more than a few nods to <em>The Next Generation</em>, significantly less the later spin-offs.<br/>~ My genericized exported elements such as <em>Pirates</em> and <em>Romans</em> have evolved significantly from their counterparts in the originals (<em>Klingons</em> and <em>Romulans</em> respectively, for example, Romans are much truer to <em>SPQR</em> preferring demonstrations of unstoppable force and superior culture over stealth and cunning.<br/>~ As I'm trying to avoid paying for IP licensing from Paramount (and shouldn't have to, since this is a parody) I've been really careful to allow Star Trek-specific diegetic elements be inferred but never expressed. I don't use any specific terms such as <em>phasers</em>, <em>tricorders</em>, <em>warp core</em> (there is a <em>power</em> core, though) and so on.* At this point, much of my diegetic elements are quite removed from their Trek-expy origins.<br/><br/>* Interestingly, warp drive or bending space is the going hypothesis as to how long distance travel would work as per the <em>Alcubierre metric</em> (by scrunching space before travelling through it, and then letting it unfurl afterwards, so that local speed never exceeds speed-of-light, or even comfortable levels of time dilation, for that matter).<br/><br/><strong>Game Title ideas:</strong><br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Fleet and Federation</em> (play on the phrase <em>King and Country</em>, also nodding to the <em>D&amp;D;</em> style RPG naming convention of the '70s)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Pioneers of the Future</em> (based on NASA's mission statement, 2006 <em>[to] pioneer the future in space exploration...</em>)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Pioneers of Tomorrow</em> (as immediately above, <em>Tomorrow</em> is a more raygun gothic term than <em>The Future</em>, as per Disney's <em>Tomorrowland</em>*)<br/><strong>Rejected names</strong><br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Trek!</em> (Working title. Would rile Paramount's lawyers)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Free Enterprise</em> (taken by a movie about trekkies pestering William Shatner. Seriously! And a sequel's in the works!)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Stars in SPACE!</em> (Too plain, and payoff of the double meaning was wasted).<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm open to, and in need of name ideas, specifically ones that might indicate a fleet-based <i>Wagon Train</i> to the stars, planet-of-hats milieu, yet won't work Paramount's lawyers into a froth.<br/><br/>* Disney is even considering <em>The Future</em> is a bit zeerusty a concept, so that Disneyland Paris features <em>Discoveryland</em> which features more steampunk and clockworkpunk themes hoping they will age better than futurological projections that need to be regularly replaced.<br/><br/>More later...<br/><em>last update: Tuesday, November 08, 2011 5:11:08 PM</em></p>

With the world on its knees, these genetically-enhanced super soldiers led mankind back to peace and prosperity, and fifty years later, a new generation born with those same extraordinary gifts, will take up that calling. Some will answer willingly, some...really won't.</p><p><br/>Eighteen-year-old Lexa Laney was debating where to spend her summer holiday after graduating from the Northeast Academy of Higher Learning when she received word that she had been accepted to the Unified Nations Military Core. This was surprising information as Lexa was confident she had not applied. Of average height, average build, and well-below-average ambition, there was no recruit less fit for service than Lexa Laney, and she was sure that twelve weeks and a new wardrobe weren't likely to change that fact. Nevertheless, it is as they say: when destiny calls, just try and play dead until it goes away.</p>

<p>Have you ever experienced those precognitive feelings?  Just knowing something terrible or amazing is going to happen shortly can shape the way you live.  After all, if you knew you where going to die, wouldn’t you live your life differently?  Well, for Clarissa she grew up experiencing these feelings more often than most.  As she got older, those feelings came more often and they always came true.  Then one day, she saw the strings for the first time.  She saw a faint line from her boyfriend John at the time, and saw how it just drifted out of his chest and followed him everywhere he went.  Later she saw how they knotted together with others strings showing how connected those people where to each other.  As this became stronger she started to experience other things as well.  She started to see how sometimes the strings seemed to fight back on their own while other times they just sat there and followed like loose hair.  <br/><br/>Then one day she had a dream.  She had a dream she was in the Forrest of Knots and could travel along the stings.  There was no time constraints, no feelings, just connections.  She caused the ripple that was noticed by the Somnio group that held charge of the Knott.  They controlled all such beings and they noticed she was strong.  They started their search for her and she continued to grow stronger.  <br/><br/>When they finally caught up to her, she was well in her 20’s and had experienced the Forest of Knotts more than she wanted.  She’s going to have to come to terms with her abilities and her roll on earth, or she’s going to die.  The Somnio doesn’t accept flounders and those who go against the grain.  They are the illuminate of the dreamscape and in turn, the world.  They don’t play nicely with others in their playground.</p>

<p>This is the first novel I've written that has a direct connection with my life. I don't know its exact plot line yet (I'll discover that in the writing, I hope), but the story will revolve around a rollicking, rogue debate team I was on when I was in high school. We were essentially the Bad News Bears of the Iowa debate circuit. We were all nerdy outcasts and punk rockers who took pride in winning any argument with our bravura rhetorical flourishes (and we liked to instigate them). Each weekend we traversed the state, led by a delinquent and debauched debate coach. And then there was teen romance, of course. Or teen yearning. And plenty of references to Nietzsche.   </p>

<p>""The Letters"" is about one of my favorite fictional subjects: tragic, forlorn lovers. I've always wanted to write an epistolary novel, so this is my first attempt at one. The catch is that it's a one-sided epistolary novel--it flows from letters written, but never sent. The protagonist intends to send them, but somehow he simply knows it's wrong (for a variety of reasons), or just can't. <br/><br/>He writes as if to a muse, to a true confessor, and his letters become a reflection on his life and the existential dilemmas he finds himself trapped in (a la Camus's ""The Fall""). The more he writes, though, the more the reader must question his reliability as a narrator. Is he a true lover, obsessed, a mad man, or all three? Has he mythologized and rehashed his memories to the point that their reality is questionable? And then there's the question of whether he'll send the letters, what will happen if he does, or if the letters will be discovered by another?<br/><br/>It's a heady task, but I'd like this novel to trace the themes of Roland Barthes' ""A Lover's Discourse.""

He takes the little money he has and goes on an Odyssey in search of Jacques Steinberg, who is convinced can solve all of his problems. It's not so easy to find Steinberg, or travel across states to get to his home.

297,laceywilson,Novel: Barefoot & All Gussied Up:Confessions of a Small Town Hom...,Genre: Personal,761,25,0,"
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Growing up in a small town has its struggles, but it also has its perks. I was born and raised in the same town as both my parents, and my grandparents were either born there as well or within a 30 mile radius. I seriously have memories walking into the grocery store and not getting to the checkout counter for an hour. Why you ask? Not because it was overcrowded but because people like to talk. Small town people love to talk! Every time we went somewhere, we knew someone. No lie. Needless to say, everyone knowing your business got old for me, especially as a teenager. But the sweetness of growing up in such a place never goes away. From the genuine handwave you receive from the people driving by the house on their way home in the country, to the smell of the loblolly pines that stood in the State Park before the 2011 wildfire wiped them out, the town of Bastrop, Texas matters more to me now more than it ever has before.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There were times I felt like a fish out of water, not just being in the town but even in my own family. I loved school and learning and was apparently better at gaining white friends than anything else. Being little Lacey was difficult. I was sensitive to negative things, and always wanted peace. That proved difficult, especially at home where chaos would erupt during what was supposed to be Sunday dinner at Granny's house. School was my escape. My teachers were my role models, and I fought hard to not be a small-town-black-girl-who-thinks-she's-better-than-everyone-else-and-talks-white. At times, I felt like I lived a double life, and it was terrifying. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I learned a lot in my hometown. As a teenager, I played volleyball from the age of 12 until I graduated from Bastrop High School and threw myself into the world of being a teen in a small town. I must say, it is something everyone should experience at 16. When you are used to dirt roads and one, maybe two stop lights on the main highway through the town, you must get creative with how you spend your time. So that's what we did. In middle school (because it's wasn't called ""junior high"" in Bastrop), if I wasn't at volleyball practice or a game, I was walking the neighborhood with friends. One of my best friends, Heather, who you will hear more about later, lived about a 10-15 minute walk from me, and we would meet halfway and decide whose house to camp out at for the evening. My cousins, extended cousins, and cousins who were really cousins but you grew up with them like they were cousins would come over every single day during the summers to hang out. Our house was always where people ended up. My mom loved it! It was a much needed change for me and my siblings after living in the country. By the time high school rolled around, I was beginning to figure some things out about myself. I had started to go to church pretty regularly by the age of 12 (as a kid we mostly went on Easter and Christmas and occasionally we would attend a family member's funeral), so as a teenager, I was considered a bonafide Jesus Freak. Yes, yes that's right. Ok, well, maybe not bonafide (yet), but attending church and attempting to read the King James Bible was a serious priority. Don't judge! I continued to play and excel at volleyball, joined Student Council, played clarinet in Wind Ensemble (only freshman year). Being in a relationship wasn't really at the forefront of my mind, for many reasons, one being I knew I was gay and there was no way in hell I was going to come out of the closet. Instead I focused on my grades, sports, and friendships. I met my very best friend, Dallas Stobaugh (now Armstrong) my sophomore year! Thinking about this now makes me sound like I was a level-headed kid with no concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That's a bold-face lie! </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Senior year. The  Jesus lovin', all's good in my world, intelligent, out-going, loving black girl fell apart. I lost it. At school. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I skipped class the entire day. I couldn't get together. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It wasn't until I was 27 that I started to put together the pieces of me that were broken. 10 years later, I figured it out. That small town of Bastrop, Texas almost got the best of me. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Almost. And for that, I am grateful. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With the exception of my brief stint at dorm life, every tear, every joy, every sorrowful and celebratory moment I had happened there until August 2015. My wife and I packed up our car and moved to California. Bastrop is the only place I know. From the religion and politics that built me up then shattered me to my grandmother's homes that are an essential part of my childhood and also the cemetery where they were both laid to rest, the streets I roamed with my siblings and friends, and the school walls that kept me safe but also gave off this superficial aroma, reminding me constantly that I truly didn't know who I was, to the pine trees. Oh, the pines. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bastrop is home. It will always be home. All the people mentioned here are a true part of me, good, bad, and darn ugly. I wouldn't have these stories to share without them. I wouldn't be who I am today without them. </span></p>

<p>Earth's superpowered humans have been exiled to an alternate Earth where they have no super abilities, but magic works.  A few generations later on this alternate Earth, in the kingdom of Hailey's Mill, an immortal king has been murdered.  Lewis, his last surviving son, who never expected to outlive his father, has been left in charge.  Unfortunately, Lewis, notoriously paranoid and suffering from severe emotional instability, decides to run away and seek his fortune elsewhere.</p>
<p>Meanwhile:</p>
<p>The newly appointed female court magician, fighting against rampant misogyny in the magical hierarchy, is busy overthrowing the magician's guild leadership while dodging their assassins.</p>
<p>The neighboring Republic of Ved, thinking to exploit the sudden, unexpected death of the king, is preparing to invade, only held back by the dead king's lawyer.</p>
<p>The undead legions imprisoned in the world-spanning mine system are becoming increasingly restless and their jailers have only an army of bees with which to keep them pacified.</p>

<p>Chapter 2: in which a machine laughs, a ghost finds closure, a wizard talks too much, and there isn't enough beer.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: in which a bee find purpose, a secretary gets some filing done, an army waits patiently, and an orphan goes hunting.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: in which a father is angry, a daughter is brave, three friends meet, and no one hears the screaming.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: in which a monster turns on the lights, a killer receives a present, the dead rest in peace, and violence begets violence.</p>
<p>Chapter 6: in which a fool makes a foolish mistake, a border is crossed, a light glows in the darkness, and a theory is tested.</p>
<p>Chapter 7: in which a general is not surprised, a prisoner has a nice lunch, a prince completes a quest, and survival becomes a possibility.</p>
<p>Chapter 8: in which hidden weapons are revealed, incompetence is punished, a throne is claimed, and there is a new sheriff in town.</p>
<p>Chapter 9: in which the truth hurts, a lie hurts even worse, plans work too well, and power corrupts.</p>
<p>Chapter 10: in which a family is reunited, a shadow survives the light, a genie is rebottled, and the true danger remains unnoticed.</p>

He romantically loves the old psychedelic music, especially Ralph's old band, which is known by now only to aficionados. He never gets to play that kind of music at his gigs. <br/><br/>Anne is a B-town-based performance artist on a trip in the Caribbean, where she meets Paul, a kind of mystical oceanographer, and it's, like, love at first sight. Paul knows River, and tells her about him. When she gets home, she and River start doing some music together. It happens she also knows Ralph, who's by now something of an old recluse, and she introduces River to him. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, as part of his college work, River's involved on a project developing a device that scans various frequencies of electromagnetic energy in a place and makes a visual image of these energies. Anne wonders if this device could be used to see ""the human aura"", and they secretly pursue this line of research, unknown to River's university sponsors. <br/><br/>When their research starts to bear fruit, they have what seems like a way to look at the ""aura of a crowd"". And when they combine this with playing music, magical and exciting things start happening, suggestive of the old ""Acid Tests"" of the 60s. Even Ralph is getting drawn in. <br/><br/>What does it feel like to move through a magical, technological storm of human and electrical energies, in the midst of ""a tuned crowd""?

<p>Eugene ""Genie"" Penn is twenty-two years old, gay, autistic, and has the incredible ability to turn invisible at will. He also has been legally classified a super villain since the day he turned eighteen due to the government's new involvement in the super hero/super villain categorization process. Whether one is a ""super hero"" is no longer based on good deeds or heroic behavior, but whether or not one fits the very specific requirements to be legally categorized as such.</p>
<p>Genie's status as a super villain is out of his control, but it doesn't stop him from blaming himself and becoming increasingly doubtful of his own self-worth, which isn't helped by the fact that he's begun to idolize a popular celebrity super hero on TV. Meanwhile, the rest of his life seems to be falling apart around him: His best friend, Sylvia Robins, finds herself in a terrible accident and is demoted from super hero to villain, and his boyfriend of two years, Soren Masih, breaks up with him after one too many fights regarding Genie's lack of confidence in his identity.</p>
<p>However, when a mysterious stranger moves into Genie's neighborhood, a super girl named Beatrice Stark who's somehow managed to be promoted from villain <em>to hero</em>, Genie suddenly finds his life taking a turn for what seems to the better. Refusing to heed the warnings of Soren and Sylvia, for the first time in his life he's given the opportunity to experience what life as a super hero is like firsthand.</p>

Will would rather backpack through Europe, getting lost in its alleyways and staying alone, while Ella would prefer to stay home and take care of her beloved, dying grandmother. Instead, they must endure abrasive parents, poetic and eccentric tour guides, quirky and snarky high schoolers, and dissatisfied honeymooners. Amidst famous masterpieces and breathtaking wonders, they must confront their own demons while figuring out what, exactly, they want out of life-- and each other. </p>

<p><em>     American Meadow</em> is the modern account of Iris Marie-Jeanne Carstensen, an enraptured devout within The New Chapel of the Meadow ...<br/>     It is the tale wherein she endures under rafters echoing with the gospel desecration of the human soul by the feral spirit of the cult. It is therein she endures the cannibalism of innocence by man's necrophiliac inclinations ...<br/>     And it is thus how we find that isolate hamlet - that christened community of Barley Meadow nestled away within a Heartland valley. It is thus a flowering attempt at Eden established upon the sin of genocides beckoning from decades passed. And thus is a tale predicated by those wars which were once sanctioned as manifestations of destiny. Thus it is that crimes against humanity are sun-bleached from the palimpsest of collective consciousness just as blood and bodies were drawn and hidden beneath prairie flowers ... <br/>     And it is there we find that all is unforgotten in the forgotten children of that plague rendered by those self-consumed pioneers, those deathly reapers. This is a ceremony of the devout, the divine, the wicked, the dead, the gone, and the lost - an ouroboros dance of infernal destruction which only few of this Holy Mass can escape.<br/><em>     American Meadow</em> is thus the story of impotent martyrdom in the quest for redemption, the realized shadow wrath of decimated peoples, and mankind's malevolent worship-defiance of the yawning void that consumes us all in the end. This is the breaking open of Hell, the venture within, and all that conspires in the aftermath. <br/>     This is the realization that more than flowers bloom within the meadow. <br/>     Abandon hope. </p>

<p>Uriel Collins knows that he is a resurrected man. He knows that he was once a villain by the name of Isaac, though he does not remember anything prior to his violent death. He's going to Mileston anyway, to seek out whatever remains of the life he inherited from Isaac. It's so hard, not having a past. Everyone needs to start somewhere.<br/><br/>There are some sins so black that even a monster couldn't possibly ignore them. When Uriel decides to dig up the crimes of Isaac Collins, both the living and the murdered have plenty they want to say. Some speak in riddles. Some speak with guns.<br/><br/>______________________________________<br/><strong>Our Intrepid Cast</strong><br/><ul><li><strong>Uriel Collins</strong> - The resurrected corpse. Uriel doesn't remember his past life as Isaac Collins, but he has a pretty good idea that he was a villain-- a gangster and a murderer and worse besides. He just came to Mileston looking for treasure. Some property, some money... why did he have to find bodies instead?</li><br/> <li><strong>Edmond Varrice</strong> - Once, Varrice was a young police officer, one who saw too many things too soon in the line of duty. He began his unofficial investigation on Isaac Collins well before he ever became a detective. Ten years later, Varrice has no case against Collins. It doesn't matter anyway; the villain he was chasing is long dead. Or... is he?</li><br/> <li><strong>Thomas Dalence</strong> - After Tom's father coughed himself to death, his mother vanished and their apartment was reclaimed by the landlord. He lives on a madman's roof now, under the big overhanging eaves where the rain doesn't usually reach. He has a stray cat for a friend, the best view in the city, and a collection of pretty rocks he found in a false brick. And he has to survive the winter. </li><br/> <li><strong>Mendel Berkish</strong> - Mendel's life hasn't gone the way he had wanted. Ten years ago he was on top of the world. Ten years ago anyone who gave him trouble would have met Isaac and be declared a suicide when they were found. Or at least, that's the way Mendel remembers it. He's never had a bigger disappointment than seeing dead Collins again, rushing up to him, ecstatic... only to find that this red-eyed giant isn't Isaac at all. It's just Isaac's body, Isaac's talents, Isaac's strengths... but without the memory, he isn't, he can't be Isaac.<br/><br/>Obviously, he needs to jog Uriel's memory. Return the memory, resurrect the man. He'd do anything. Those were the glory days... right?</li><li><strong>Nathan Imerson</strong> - The current 'king' of the Southside Slums. Before Isaac Collins died, Imerson helped him steal a collection of priceless jewels, which Collins stole from the gang and hid privately. He took the location to his treasure to his grave ten years ago, and it's been out of Imerson's reach ever since. Mister Imerson would like to change that. He's not much interested in seeing his old rival walk away alive after the fact, though.</li><br/> <li><strong>Old Missus Bones</strong> - They call the inventors that specialize in plants and chemicals and genetic engineering 'bio-junkies' in the empire. Missus Bones would laugh at that; she's just a harmless old widow. But she'll take your corpses off your hands, for a price. She must feed her darling plants, the poor dears. And should you come across something interesting, she'd be happy to hear all about it.</li><br/></ul></p>

But as NEILA grows, their secrets become harder to keep from the world, and as pressure mounts, infighting threatens to jeopardize their successful interplanetary partnership. Eventually the debate between right and wrong becomes less defined and the question arises whether monetary success has been blinding to the bigger question: is humanity really ready to greet other worlds?</p>

The department is in charge of making sure the wizards remain in good standing with the US public and the US government. This is not a job to be taken lightly, as magic is inherently toxic and unpredictable, which is the main reason why so many young wizards are orphans: it is a rare wizard who manages to live past the age of 60.</p><p>Margaret's first assignment will involve investigating a recording made by a herpetologist in the Pacific Northwest. Apparently, the frogs he caught on tape reproduced, with a high degree of faithfulness, a performance of Verdi's ""La Traviata"". This would be odd enough in and of itself, except that particular performance only took place two weeks later.</p><p>Margaret sets off to Oregon to investigate. The more she looks into the matter, the more puzzling it all gets. And it's going to get even more puzzling once she gets a phone call in the middle of the night from Freshkills Academy in New York, informing her that her sister (and legal ward) Sunny is in danger of being expelled.</p><p>&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;

Until she sees a blue thing sculking through the top rooms, blurry and indistict without her glasses, but a shape and a colour, and she is determined to find out what it is. Along with her only friend, the equally outcast Fred and the depressed dog called Coud, Snook leaves her battered home to explore the houses, and the graveyard, and the strange woman next door who says there are people trapped in her mirrors.<br/><br/>They stumble upon, or are shown, passages and doors that lead to other Worlds, and different versions of their own, where experiments are played out and Snook must decide who is truly her friend, and if anyone is experimenting on her.<br/><br/>Snook finds herself inbetween people who lie, to her or themselves, where not everyone can truly be real when they all contradict each other, and she must question the true madness as she finds her own worth and meaning in a World not quite right.<br/><br/>Are any of Snook's memories or thoughts truly what she sees? Or has she, too, slipped into a madness that clouds her vision?</p>

Beethoven wants to find them, to bring her mother back from the dead. She already knows one of these stones exist – as her mother handed Beethoven a green diamond with her last breath. Even though Beethoven does not know how or why her mother had one of the stones, she is determined to bring her back if it means she can find out.<br/>Along the way, she meets The Jack – a trader who after finding out she has one of the fabled stones tags along to help her. The Jack knows more about magic than most and can help them.<br/>She also meets Simon, a boy from Earth. Simon has no idea how he got to this world of Carlione, the last thing he can remember is being stabbed by a drunkard in an alleyway in London, and now he suddenly finds himself in a world filled with faeries, magic and girls with names like Beethoven. Simon does not know if he’s really here, in a coma or worse, but he thinks if he can find these stones, surely they will be able to take him home.<br/>However, it may not matter that Simon does not know how he got to Carlione, if the Monarchy got hold of him, he could be hanged without trial, unless he can prove he was bought to Carlione against his will and did not travel there through a portal like the travellers of old.<br/></p>

<p>Alright, since I suppose anyone who checks out my synopsis deserves to actually see something...<br/><br/>This story is my fantasy. It's what I've always thought about, what I've always dreamt of, and what's always on the horizon... just around the corner. It's the blink, the quiet days, the wind in the trees. It's a lamp flickering, it's a dark doorway, it's everything unseen. It's the world I have been dreaming of forever, and never writing.<br/><br/>Because it's that one thing, it's where you suddenly notice something isn't quite right. It's that day that for some reason it's too quiet...but a silent, hidden, <em>something</em> is waiting around the corner. Something electric and inspiring, something that will take you away just like you've always wanted. Something that will tell you finally, irrevocably that the world you dream of can be, and is, real.<br/><br/>This story has no path, right now, and is about a man who will drop everything to chase a dream. To take that chance and fly away. This story is about a man called Caid, and an adventurer called Foxfire. This story is about walking forward when you have the chance, and daring to believe it will work out.

<p>This year, I'm not going to be writing a novel during NaNoWriMo. Instead, I'm working on a series of short stories inspired and based on folk songs, particularly on the 'Child ballads', but also other songs. They'll be under 5k each, some a little longer than others, so it's going to take at least ten stories to hit wordcount, and probably more.</p>
<p>I completed the first one before November, so it doesn't count as part of NaNo, but I've listed it below anyway.</p>
<p>For the most part, I'm rewriting the stories to have little or no romance, and where it's essential to have romance, I'm giving it a twist -- usually by changing the genders of the characters either to reverse the roles or to make them LGBTQ. But I'm trying to focus on other kinds of love -- familial affection and friendship, primarily.</p>
<p>I'm posting the stories (along with covers, which is very exciting!) on Wattpad. It's my first foray into Wattpad, and I'm a little nervous about joining a new community, but if you'd like to read along, <a href=""https://www.wattpad.com/user/MiriamJoyWrites"">you can find my profile here</a>.

<p>BENEATH THE BRANCHES<br/><br/>Based on the legend of the fourth century king, Niall of the Nine Hostages, this epic novel spanned the King's birth to his death. It involved my first experience of winning NaNoWriMo during the first week — specifically, on day seven. It was also incredibly terrible, with numerous instances of head hopping and just poor writing, so I never bothered to edit it. Still, I was still fairly new to the writing game at that point. At 126k, it was also the longest novel I've written to date. Well, what do you expect when it spans a guy's entire life?<br/><br/>FIGUREHEAD<br/><br/>This marginally less disastrous novel followed the story of Alanna, the Queen in a futuristic England, who was determined to regain some of the power of her ancient predecessors. Although still not a great novel, and with various cameo appearances including Mr Ian Woon, it's the kind of thing that if I'm ever stuck for inspiration, I will go back and rewrite it. Maybe. Or at least, harvest some ideas.</p>

<p>This was the first novel I ever completed.<br/><br/>I was no exception to the rule. It was completely terrible. Then again, I started on November 7 with no idea what I was going to write — I didn't even have any characters, let alone a genre or a plot — and finished 15 days later with 51,000 words of passable crap. To be fair, I was only 13, and I had no idea what I was doing… But basically the novel was terrible.<br/><br/>It took clichéd tropes to a whole new level, I'm not gonna lie. But, earlier this year (2013) I took the central concept of the novel and wrote an entirely new book with it. I think that just goes to prove that even the worst novels are sometimes worth writing.<br/><br/>And, because this was my first novel, it still remains the most important thing I ever wrote.

Only barely did a handful of willworkers from the Anima Mundi manage to thwart his plans, and to send him to his demise, his last spell left uncompleted.<br/><br/>But now something's amiss in London. Something that is whispering the name of Valdemar, and looking for his soul. Something that has twisted the holiest of names, and wishes to burn down the Thorn Wall protecting humans from spectres. Something that seems to be long dead, but whose allies can yet walk the land of the living. This time, too, a handful of mages is trying to prevent a city from falling whole into the Deadlands. But time is short, and their opponents more than meet the eye.<br/><br/>(( This is the second part of ""Was"", the story I started for NaNoWriMo in 2009.

The latter's interest in Lou and Lyle prompted Echoes and Ring to protect them.

<p>The news in Syria Planum are alarming. A strange epidemic has declared itself in town, forcing the city council to declare a state of quarantine and forbid everyone to enter or go out of the dome. The situation seems to be the same in other domes as well, and what had seemed like isolated outbursts of the virus at first now appear daily. In the middle of this, a handful of individuals with apparently nothing in common find themselves with more information than they thought about what's really behind the epidemic.</p><p>Jen the hacker investigates the death of one of her friends, killed by the virus, but not before he could give her worrying documents hinting at man's hand being behind it. Heiji the assassin finds himself the target of his former employer, an old funding Corporation, after having taken part in the extraction of one of their scientists. Deanna Shaw, an agent of the Corporation itself, realizes that killing her former partner that she thought dead is easier said than done, and a difficult order to carry. Somewhere in town, terrorized by what she has taken part in, a scientist remains torn between hiding and waiting for the epidemic to be circumvened, and standing up to try to fight what she helped create. When all meet and unveil that the virus itself is a backfiring part of a plot with old roots, what is left for them to do, trapped as they are in the contaminated city and continuously targeted by corporate agents? Fight back, of course.</p>

While everyone in this strange new world loves writing, they seem to value quantity over quality.

<p>One shot. In and out. A shadow. A bump in the night. No name. No past. No future. Nearly one hundred targets and not a single failed mission. An accuracy that would make even Olympic marksmen jealous. That is all her life was. Until that one night. A single hair off of her target. A miss. One miss and the mission blew in her face. Having to answer to failure for the first time since entering Black Ops. <br/><br/>Except there is no answer she can give. No way to tell that her accuracy is not simply due to hours and hours of practice. Able to literally see a target from a mile off with her gift, Aura is learning that years of pushing the limit is literally costing her that precious vision she needs to do the one thing she has been good at.<br/><br/>In his darkest hour she came to him. That one night in the thick hot jungles of Brazil she had stumbled upon him and she appeared as an angel of mercy. Promising to help her when she would need him most, Liam never expected to repay the life debt he now owed her. Until the night once more brought their paths together.<br/><br/>Learning that time is running out not only to complete her failed mission, but also her eyesight. They are left with a single choice. She must join his world to save both her eyesight and her life. <br/><br/>Unsure if she can trust someone completely Aura is thrown deeper into the darkest reaches of the world. Her entire adult life she had been told over and over again, the moment trust is placed in someone it will be her looking down a barrel of a gun. The one holding that gun is not who she expects and it will take everything in her to prove that trust is not death sentence, but can she prove it before she can remove the target from her own back?</p>

<p><strong>Life under the dome</strong></p>
<p>For the past 200 years Chicago has been encased in a dome, protecting it from the outside world.  Beyond the curved, steel wall lies a wasteland; a stew of nuclear fallout, weaponized viruses and bacteria, and feral packs of animals and survivors.  Inside, life is experienced through the wonders of digital networking.  The town is a constant buzz of 24-hour news, video chats, and ever-circling drones. </p>
<p><strong>Life under a watchful eye.</strong></p>
<p>Jane is depressed.  Considered an outsider, Jane has cut herself off from the digital life, craving true human interaction.  This has cost her friends, family, and anything resembling a relationship.  Spiraling into a deep depression, the constant noise and activity slowly begins to drive her to the very edge of reason.</p>
<p><strong>Life, or something like it.</strong></p>
<p>Jane hears a rumor, a story, a myth, really.  A group of survivors, far beyond the reach of the Dome.  A group that is not dependent on technology to communicate.  A group that lives somewhere where the nights are quiet and the stars still shine at night.  A group known as the Quiet Ones.  But attempting to leave the Dome is illegal, a violation that would change Jane from an outsider to a criminal, someone, certainly, that would be judged insane.  Not to mention the deadly wasteland outside, the fact that she doesn’t know where these Quiet Ones might be, and she’s pretty sure she may have just killed her neighbor and her neighbor’s yappy little dog.</p>

<p>There is little to do on an island isolated from the rest of the world save either become a helpless drunk or master a skill. So says American expatriate Mr. Thomas, who has chosen to do both. He is a virtuoso of propaganda, a gifted forger, and considered by many the subversive genius of the world. For years his polemics have undermined the colonial powers, making his only safe refuge a dingy apartment tucked away in an alley somewhere on his island home. Yet when the British authorities pin him down and contract a single piece of writing that will permanently undermine American colonial interests and lionize British imperialism, Thomas does not refuse. For the reward is an impossible dream long abandoned, and refusal means his death.</p>
<p>When the august propagandist initially approaches his task with enthusiasm, his English handlers are ecstatic. However the tale that he begins to weave in his assortment of notes, diaries, and letters soon reflects an even greater threat, a knot of absurdities and lies that none can disprove when Thomas declares, <em>All is true.</em></p>
<p>The year is 2082, and the island is still called by the natives ""Ireland"".</p>

<p>These are Chicago's last days. In one time and place, the humans who reside there do not know it, a cacophony of their voices yet shout against the world for substance, money, absolution, destruction. In another time and place are They who come after, engaged in an odyssey for hope and understanding, fated to end no better than their human counterparts. Against a brutal world that turns without them, a song goes out from the two cities into the void, noise become signal, and it calls for that which will end more than their city.</p>

<p>At the height of the French Revolution in 1792, only forty-four monks remained on the once glorious isle of Mont Saint-Michel. With word of the imprisonment of the King, anti-clerical sentiment from the mainland, and an English navy thirsty for plunder crossing the Channel, they closed the monastery and left. In 1793, the Jacobins converted the island into a prison for the clergy who opposed their rule. History holds that in the intervening year, the citadel simply stood empty. This is another tale of that year on the solitary island, not true but perhaps not quite false; of her zealots, her outcasts, her looters, and her undercity come into the light.</p>

<p>A series of mysterious disappearances and deaths throughout coastal Maine and New Brunswick lead back to an international conspiracy devised and lead by two men. Investigations into the case unearth a series of seemingly random online postings that not only appear to have predicted the crime spree, but indicate that only one of the men is truly guilty, the other an unsuspecting pawn caught up in something greater than himself. Told with the voices of the rogue's gallery thus assembled: an old man obsessed with a shipwreck on the night of his birth; a powerful fishing clan whose grip on their small town is slipping; a messianic lunatic guiding his derelict freighter and her flock on prayer alone; a woman who sees Atlantis when she closes her eyes; a modern day Quixote who has found that Atlantis in the Irish Sea; and a score of others, it becomes a tale of dreamers and fools who have chosen to sail against the wind.</p>

<p>Charlotte Black couldn’t remember her parents. She didn’t know if they had been good people or bad people. She didn’t know what their hobbies were, or what her father had done for work. She did not remember a thing about them. Although she grew up in foster homes, Charlotte wasn’t a girl entirely without sense. She was, after all, still alive at the age of sixteen, and fairly well looked after; though, much of that was owed to the fact that she was quiet and mundane.<br/><br/>All of her plans to lead an unassuming life are thrown into disarray the minute she sets foot in Thornton Hall. There is something both eerily familiar and foreboding about the home for children who have no where else to go. When a secret door is unlocked, Charlotte Black steps into a realm unlike anything she had ever seen, but as she delves further into Otherworld, the mysteries surrounding her past begin to unravel. Secrets long kept hidden are revealed and Charlotte learns just what she is made of.</p>

<p>Mia O’Connor had always been a lone wolf. She was cute and had a select group of friends but still felt out of place in her suburban home outside of Portland. She spent most days broodingly drinking coffee in between college courses and working on her blog. She had her sights set on a job in LA with every intent of leaving behind her old life and never looking back. That is until she met Cooper Randolph, a dreamy high school teacher who showed her that not everything in Portland is worth forgetting.</p>
<p>It only took them from thanksgiving to graduation to fall head over heals with each other and decide to take their relationship long distance when Mia lands the dream job and starts her life in southern California. Immediately she is thrown into the role of Hollywood socialite; immersing herself among friends of the young pop culture elite. Between attending A-List events and being followed around by the paparazzi at every turn, she meets a charismatic actor named Luca who makes her question even the most definitive aspects of her character-including her loyalty to Cooper. While she never cheated on him, when Cooper came to visit months after her move, they both realize their lives were no longer compatible. Cooper was pursuing teaching in Portland and Mia was quickly climbing the social ladder. If only to make things worse, Luca convinces Mia that she has to choose between the two men.</p>
<p>Ultimately she calls it quits with distance to give her Hollywood lifestyle its best shot, only for Cooper to quickly start dating someone new as well. She also quickly realizes that Luca was not exactly who she thought he was. He thrives living the rockstar life even when it becomes destructive through late nights, diva tantrums, and drug use so their relationship quickly becomes dysfunctional. All the while, Mia and Cooper never broke contact and although they weren’t together they found comfort in confiding in one another. However, once Cooper and his new girlfriend announce their engagement, Mia no longer wants him in her life. She never fully moved on but he is starting a life with someone new.</p>
<p>Months go by and Mia stays single, burying herself in her career until she goes home for Christmas. She had been living in LA for almost two years but had only been home to visit once so this homecoming was way over due. She had avoided all of her regular spots in hopes of avoiding Cooper but of course on her last day home she runs into him. They exchange typical pleasantries you would expect from exes asking how they were doing, saying they looked good and mentioning each others relationship status. To her surprise, he broke off his engagement. Although he doesn’t say why and she doesn’t ask, but Mia can’t help but wonder if she was part of the reason. Regardless, they bid each other farewell and it’s obvious they both have a feeling it will be for the last time.</p>

<p><strong>Life under the dome</strong></p>
<p>For the past 200 years Chicago has been encased in a dome, protecting it from the outside world.  Beyond the curved, steel wall lies a wasteland; a stew of nuclear fallout, weaponized viruses and bacteria, and feral packs of animals and survivors.  Inside, life is experienced through the wonders of digital networking.  The town is a constant buzz of 24-hour news, video chats, and ever-circling drones. </p>
<p><strong>Life under a watchful eye.</strong></p>
<p>Jane is depressed.  Considered an outsider, Jane has cut herself off from the digital life, craving true human interaction.  This has cost her friends, family, and anything resembling a relationship.  Spiraling into a deep depression, the constant noise and activity slowly begins to drive her to the very edge of reason.</p>
<p><strong>Life, or something like it.</strong></p>
<p>Jane hears a rumor, a story, a myth, really.  A group of survivors, far beyond the reach of the Dome.  A group that is not dependent on technology to communicate.  A group that lives somewhere where the nights are quiet and the stars still shine at night.  A group known as the Quiet Ones.  But attempting to leave the Dome is illegal, a violation that would change Jane from an outsider to a criminal, someone, certainly, that would be judged insane.  Not to mention the deadly wasteland outside, the fact that she doesn’t know where these Quiet Ones might be, and she’s pretty sure she may have just killed her neighbor and her neighbor’s yappy little dog.</p>

In the West, the empires of old crumble under the weight of tradition. The disease infects even the South, where the nomadic Vulpa have attacked human colonists and even their own tribes in search of dwindling reservoirs. <br/><br/>A young woman treks through a forest, back toward the village that broke her long ago. A girl awakes in a tower, haunted by the expectations and foreboding etched in her mothers face. A woman leaves a prison, only to find the outside world just as confining due to the color of her skin and the brand on her arm. A Vulpa's search for water grows desperate, forcing her to lead her people toward humanity, where they promised never to venture. <br/><br/>A red moon rises in the sky, a harbinger of death and a promise of hope to come. The symbols draws the daughters together in hopes of saving their shared home before the affliction destroys them all.</p>

<p>Music has the power to inspire great men to action, and soothe restless souls. It has the power to paint awe-inspiring scenes of beauty in the mind of the listener. It has the power to shake the ground, bolster armies and carry massive skyships through the air. Literally. The Rota Union has secured power over the continent through their use of Melodicians, talented individuals that can shape the world around them with their music. But as powerful as this ability is, it may not be enough to fend off the hordes from the east.<br/><br/>Professor Nin Rylock, however, is not involved in anything quite that flashy. Nin studies Arithmancy, the mathematical laws that underpin the entire universe, including Melodics. Unfortunately, his research hasn't uncovered many real-world applications as of late. But that may change with his latest discovery: a fundamental equation that would allow Melodics to be used in new and novel ways. But to test it, Nin needs a Chanter. And those are hard to come by. Nin is elated when he stumbles on Layna, an extraordinarily talented Chantress. But with talent comes stubbornness, and getting Layna to cooperate may be more work than it's worth. <br/><br/>When the war comes to their backyard, however, Nin's research comes second to survival. Nin and Layna manage to escape, only to find that Nin's equation has been stolen by the enemy. Now they must put Nin's work and Layna's talents to the test to end the war before it ends them.</p>

<p>When Jason Todd stole the tires off the Batmobile, it wasn't Batman who caught him in the act, it was Catwoman. Selina is the mother Jason never had, and Jason is the talented student that Selina never knew she wanted. Jason becomes 'Stray,' her sidekick to counter Batman's Robin. Of course Batman isn't thrilled, but Robin kind of likes the new kid, and he likes him even more when he meets him as 'Jason' in the halls of Gotham Academy.</p>
<p>So what changes? How are things different if Jason is never Robin? This is an exploration of the stories of Jason Todd, Dick Grayson, Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, and everyone around them. To see how Jason's life is different with Selina as a mentor, and how everyone else's lives change around him.</p>

<p>(This is DC Comics, the Earth-3 universe! Inadvertently became Grayson/Todd, with Roy/Jade and background Jokester/Harlequin.)</p>
<p>This is the story of Richard Grayson, a child acrobat whose parents were murdered so he could be taken, and turned into the living weapon of Gotham's king of shadows, Owlman. Renamed under the title 'Talon', Grayson grows up an emotionally shut down killer, and spends years working under his supervillain creator as the enforcer of Owlman's will. However, even as shut down as he is, Grayson is fully aware that the career he's been forced into is one that will kill him before too long. To escape, he aligns with Owlman's greatest nemesis - the Jokester - and uses the hero to fake his own death.</p>
<p>After four years hiding in Metropolis, Grayson gets a call from the Jokester, who's calling in the debt he owes. When he returns to Gotham he comes face to face with the second Talon, a Gotham street rat by the name of Jason Todd. Unwilling to turn away, Grayson helps the Jokester rescue Jason from the same fate he narrowly escaped, at the cost of accidently making Owlman aware that he's still alive.</p>
<p>Now, hiding with the Jokester and his wife, Harlequin, Grayson and Jason are stuck in an unenviable position. One of the most dangerous supervillains in the world, a founding member of the powerful Crime Syndicate, wants them both dead as threats to his reputation, and neither of them have the skills to fight him. They'll have to find someone willing to help two trained killers, as well as figure out who they are to each other, and what they're going to do now that they're in the open.</p>
<p>(Also, Roy Harper and a reverse!Outlaws team with these three. Just saying.)</p>

<p>It's been five years since Sarana started seeing the future and the past, starting with the witness of their mother's suicide. Five years of hell, of endless nightmares, of waking in the night screaming. Her life is controlled by it. She never knows when she's going to slip into either future or past, the visions crowding into her life, pointless pieces of the past she cannot change, the many futures that could be, that might be, that will be, with no sign as to tell which ones will pass.</p>
<p>Her life is a disjointed revolution of sleeping when she can, being woken by the nightmares, patching her self inflicted wounds, trying to find some sort of balance in her life, helping out around the house, making herself as useful as possible. The time she spends in the forge helps; something about the intensity of her focus there, with the heat and the metal, and her hands shaping steel into useful things, it keeps the visions away for a little while, gives her some respite. The neat ability to sidestep any stray spark, well, that doesn't make up for the horror story the rest of her life is. She knows those with strong powers have difficulty controlling it at first. Five years, and the worst is still to reveal itself to her...</p>
<p>Amidst drowning, she sees the end of the universe. Chaos has poisoned all the worlds, every plane of existence, destroying everything. Seeing the creators, the Great Spirits, dead and decaying, driven to insanity before her own death beside them. Worse, every possibility she sees leads to that end. </p>
<p>Then she sees one. One future among all the endings that might just give the universe a chance. It is uncertain, dangerous, and requires huge sacrifices from her. She will do anything to bring it about, even if she has to betray the family she loves, send others to sacrifice themselves for the barest hope of securing this future. She needs to learn control - and fast, or she will die before she even gets close.</p>

<p>CHARLIE KENTER is a 15 year old boy with a lot on his mind. He’s in foster care, he’s been sexually abused, and his therapist isn’t particularly helpful in understanding his nightmares. Living in Los Angeles, Charlie dreams nightly about earthquakes (especially the Big One), zombies, alien invasions and armed intruders invading his school. He clings to the hope that he’ll get a family of his own.<br/><br/>His caseworker LINDA introduces him to MICHAEL CHAN, a middle-aged Chinese American who wants to adopt as a single father. Though this is not the family unit Charlie had dreamed of, he soon acclimatizes to a trans-racial adoption and is happy to reboot his life with Michael, his beloved 12-year old dachshund, his conservative Tiger parents who’re eager to teach him about Chinese food and culture, and his goofy best friend, FRANKIE.<br/><br/>However a month after the adoption is finalized, Michael is relocated to Austin for a new job. The just forming father and son bonds are uprooted and tested in a strange new world called Texas. Michael rents a house with a pool, eager to make a new home for them. The two Californians are soon dealing with a triple-digit Texas summer, the nosey neighborhood gossip HARRIET, and all around culture shock.<br/><br/>While Michael is busy at his new job, Charlie feels bored, neglected and resentful. He refuses to call Michael ""dad"" or ""father.""  He’s irritated by Michael’s constant whining at the lack of authentic Chinese food.  He’s annoyed by countless voice mails from his old caseworker, Linda.  Charlie skateboards around his new neighborhood and meets a warm and friendly couple, ROY and ASHLEY. To Charlie, they are the ideal parents.  He lies to the couple about his age, telling them he’s eighteen years old.  He enjoys hanging out with them. He even opens up about his incident of sexual abuse and is delighted to find Roy understanding, even proud of his experiences. To help Charlie make some money, Roy hires the boy to do yard work.  Roy eventually reveals he has an unusual creative outlet – he shoots erotic photos in his converted garage studio.<br/><br/>Roy suggests to Charlie that he could make a lot of money modeling.  After an embarrassing first photo shoot, Charlie decides to avoid the couple, but when Michael's dog accidentally drowns in the pool, Charlie is terrified that Michael will blame him. He contacts Roy to do another photo shoot, needing money to get back to L.A.  Roy agrees to help.<br/><br/>When Charlie heads over for the photo shoot, he’s roofied and wakes up tied up in the garage. Roy and Ashley have an obscene experiment in mind. But Michael tracks Charlie down and rescues him from the psychotic couple in a fierce hand to hand battle that ends up in the garage studio going up in flames. <br/><br/>Charlie awakes in the hospital to find his new father has saved him. Michael’s parents are there.  Frankie is there.  And even Linda is there, but she brings a surprise guest -- Charlie’s half-brother, JAMIE.  Finally feeling safe in this family, Charlie calls Michael ""Pops.""<br/></p>

<p>Book 2 of the Chronicles of Sarducia. I had already written book 2 but then I realized that there was so much missing from the first half that it should become two books, keeping most of it for book 3. So this project will fill in what happens between books 1 &amp; 3.<br/><br/>In the first book, By Moonrise (tentatively scheduled for publication in Dec. 2015), we meet Kate Norton, who unexpectedly travels to the island kingdom of Sarducia, a place of magic and mystery. She finds herself squarely in the middle of a dispute between two royal brothers and a group of mages known as the Sarnoc who hide most of their abilities from the king.<br/><br/>One of Kate's struggles throughout By Moonrise is to discover why she has traveled there and what her purpose is. At the end of the book it seems like she has found her ""happily ever after"" but political demands snatch that away from her almost immediately, forcing her to follow a new path that seems to go against the desires of her new friends and helps her enemies.<br/><br/>Beyond that? We'll see. :)<br/><br/></p>

<p>In a AU 21st century world where polytheistic religions exist side by side with monotheistic ones; each pantheon has their own heaven and their own hell. The only beings who can move freely between the borders are the Reapers who ferry their passengers to heaven and hell, and the Hell Hounds whose job it is to know the scent of the condemned as well as to track and retrieve the very few condemned that manage to escape over the millennia.<br/><br/>Datura is unique among the denizens of the supernatural realms. A Hell Hound born into a humanoid form she was given the title of Huntress, and the responsibility of overseeing the hunts in the mortal world. Smart, cunning, and determined to prove herself to those who deem her anathema; she has never failed a hunt. However, the most recent escapee of the hells is more cunning than most and well knows how to use the every day life of the big cities to evade capture.<br/><br/>Jeremy is a doctor who has dedicated his life to helping those who desperately need it. He is compassionate, grounded, and fierce in his battle against losing his patients to death. If he happens to see shadows out of the corners of his eyes when patients die, it’s surely because he’s tired and stressed. Nothing could have prepared him  for the sight of a woman and a pack hounds, that no one else seems to notice, running through his hospital. Or for that matter, seeing a coma patient jump out of a 6th floor window and run away.<br/><br/>Datura does not need some one getting in her way and Jeremy is not about to stop trying to find his patient. But both are hunting the same being (sort of) and Jeremy knows more about the city than Datura. An arrangement has been struck, now it’s time to see if joining forces will help them save the people of the city from the evil that has been unleashed amongst them.</p>

<p>In a society where Gender is based on the needs of society, can love still change the hardest hearts.</p>
<p>Lucca and Rani are soldier trainees who were recently transferred to the Padua Military Academy. As with all academies, gender selection is a prize to be one or it is enforced by work selection based on grades and availability. Neither had given it thought before until Lucca is smitten by the Commodore's daughter in a chance meeting. Now he must fight to win his masculinity while also ingratiating himself to the Minola family.</p>

The forest also separated the central hub of the ship where navigation and command rule over the outer ring of the ship.</p>
<p>Robyn is the third generation born on the ship and begins to question the claims that the central hub has still found no planet to colonize. Others in the outer ring have begun to rebel against the control of the hub which is furthered by Robyn's research into their claims. The hub begins to squeeze the outer ring and Robyn uses the forest to keep those in control from destroying the people. All the while she attempts to rest control of the ship and possibly the future of its residents.</p>

Be it a flat tire, hexed baseball bat, ripped costume, or the ghost haunting the bakery on North Street, she can handle it.</p><p>But no amount of turning something off and then back on can fix it when Leona's husband strolls up and knocks on the front door.  Considering he has been dead and buried for almost a decade, he looks fairly...alive. </p><p>She does the best she can, with what she has available. And if it takes a little duct tape, swearing, and shoving her supposed-to-be-dead-as-disco former husband into the coat closet to avoid upsetting the kids on a school night, well, a mom's got to do what a mom's got to do.</p>

Unfortunately for him, his niece Zoe has come back from an expedition with a rare egg that will turn his life upside down. The newly hatched bird turns out to be a rare scrying bird, which must be delivered to the king in order to maintain the stability of the kingdom.<br/><br/>The premise of this world is that various species of parrot have the natural ability to channel magical powers. Mages can acquire and bond to these birds and then use them to perform a variety of tasks. I'm aiming to make the parrots realistic in terms of temperament and intelligence, so they're not reliable for things like combat, but they can be used for a variety of crafts. Magecraft isn't flashy and can be purchased as an apprenticeship if you can afford a bird. Late medieval technology is thus augmented by guilds with mages able to make things like bullet proof glass, easily reproducible texts and brightly colored fabrics. So basically, parrot-punk.</p>

With a comfortable upper-management position in the Spire, a pleasant if slightly bizarre relationship with his coworkers, and a roof that didn't even leak, he thought he had it made. When a new tavern opens up nearby, however, Olenn finds himself wondering if maybe his litle haven of security is quite as perfect as he thought - or if, just maybe, there might be something more than stability to aspire to.</p>

Her carefully-constructed plans go off the rails one night, though, when a friend comes to her with a problem: Nicelle's father is missing and she can't convince the constables that he hasn't just been delayed on a trip. What begins as a simple fact-finding mission quickly spins out of Asha's control, and she finds herself caught up in the middle of exactly the sort of adventure she might otherwise have wanted to collect and report. <br/><br/>Across the strait in Avial, Brennan Jacquerin's way of life is not nearly as stable as he thought it was. When his order turns down the requested assassination of Eshadrin Madrine, a visiting diplomat's daughter, the young assassin suddenly finds his entire world falling down around him. Refusing to be denied, the lord who placed the hit takes matters into his own hands, and Brenn's mentor is the first casualty in the conflict. His quest to avenge her is complicated slightly by deep-seated corruption within the order of assassins, and the sudden appearance of menacing foreigners wielding magics everyone had assumed were long-dead. What first seemed like a simple if brutal act of angry retaliation quickly proves to be much more complicated, and Brenn is right in the middle of it all.</p>

<p>Humanity, inevitably, destroyed the planet. At least, they did so enough that the apocalypse might as well have happened in 2012, when everyone thought it was going to. Fossil fuel abuse and expulsion of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere cause enough damage and division to break the global nation that had formed to combat those selfsame fears.  The deliberate catastrophic meltdown of nuclear reactors across the globe by a radical element was the final nail in that particular coffin.<br/><br/>Gradually, three factions emerge from the chaos. At the top sit the privileged few - the executives of a multinational corporation that had the money and the means to survive the devastation, albeit in a different form. While their employees are down to earth, the executives live in a bubble of hope. The common man, however, is downtrodden and abused, and the workers have risen up in rebellion. While not necessarily organised, they do answer to a basic authority. Aside from both, and yet against both, lies a vicious mercenary group, determined to enforce their view of order upon the world.<br/><br/>All wish for a better place, and all strive for it in their own way, but those ways are not compatible.<br/><br/>The world, once divided, must unite; once united, must divide. Thus begins the story of the Three Kingdoms, as told by Luo Guanzhong. Once Divided is a sci-fi, post-apocalyptic retelling of that ancient story.</p>

<p><strong>Horoscope For the Week of October 25-31</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leo (20 March – 20 April): </strong>Be wary of enemies bearing gifts! Things will look bright for you at the beginning of the week, but don't let it lull you into a false sense of security. A task you once previously believed to be simple may turn out to be more trouble than it's worth. An unexpected turn could lead you to reconnecting with old friends. You can't change what happens to you, only how it affects your sunny outlook. Remember to smile for those who won't smile anymore!</p>
<p><strong>Scorpio (23 October – 22 November): </strong>Keep your wits about you, Scorpio! You've risen in prominence and it's your time to shine, but remember that a glimmer in the dark attracts all kinds. Your natural inclination for conflict might actually benefit you for once. What was once hidden will reveal itself to you towards the middle of the week, but the answer you find may only bring on more questions. May you find happiness in knowing, Scorpio. You would be the first person in history to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Capricorn (22 December – 20 January):</strong> You keep running away, but the ground won't meet your feet anymore. You have a mouthful of excuses, but no one wants to hear them. All your chickens are coming home to roost. They're catching up, looking for answers. Boy oh boy, do you have a lot to answer for. </p>
<p><strong>Virgo (23 August – 23 September):</strong> Be patient. You'll get what's coming to you.</p>

<p>It’s always interesting to describe your book to people, since a novel like this, at 200,000 words, is going to mean very different things to different people. If you want a more straightforward explanation of what the book’s about, read the Publisher’s Weekly review below. If you want something more casual, read the <a href=""http://www.brandonsanderson.com/elantris-prologue"">prologue</a>. If you want something between, read on!</p>
<p>Tor classifies this book as an epic fantasy. I’m not sure if that’s actually the case. There is no quest in this book, nor is it about the end of the world. It takes place (as many of my books do) in one city, and is a mixture of political intrigue, interesting magic, and character dynamics.</p>
<p>The setting is the city of Elantris and the surrounding suburbs. There’s a force in Arelon known as the Dor that randomly chooses people and grants them divine powers. Elantris was once the city of the gods, where anyone who was ‘chosen’ went to live. Ten years ago, the Elantrians lost their powers and caught a terrible disease instead. From that point on, Elantris became a prison city/contamination zone for any who caught that disease, for the Dor continues to choose people and curse them.</p>
<p>The book follows the experiences of three people as they interact with the people of Elantris. Raoden, a prince, catches the disease in chapter one and is thrown into the city by his own father. Sarene, Raoden’s sight-unseen fiancee from a political treaty, arrives in the city and gets involved in schemes, troubles, and politics involving Elantris. Hrathen, a priest and missionary, is sent to convert the people of Arelon, and is told that if he fails, the people of the country will need to be killed instead.</p>
<p>The three stories intertwine as the truth of what happened to Elantris, and its inhabitants, ten years ago is unearthed.</p>

<p>Well, it did not <em>begin</em> with the delivery truck, so to speak. It began whenever the Wings of Refuge Care Center was founded. The Care Center was a huge, ugly brick building, walled in and windowless and stale-smelling. All of the children there had wings, feathered and colorful. White, brown, black, green, blue, red. The only source of color in that drab place.</p>
<p>One could get out of the Care Center if they really tried. If they swallowed their vitamin pills and oiled their feathers and flew in the wind tunnels until their muscles burned. If they bullied the others but were sweet to the nurses. The ones who excelled were taken away in pomp. The ones who failed – sickened or mutated – simply disappeared in the night, and no one was to speak of them.</p>
<p>But still there were whispers of a place called the Eyrie. Another way out. Raziel, who had twice attempted escape – Raziel, who claimed to remember life outside – believed in the Eyrie.</p>

<p>In the city of Vespra, there is nothing to hold humanity back from making the kind of technological progress we had once only dreamed of. With conventional ethics taking a back seat to the need for medical advancements, the metropolis has become a playground for ambitious scientists, doctors and entrepreneurs. Shutting itself off from the rest of the world, scientists here are able to focus on their innovations without the moral scrutiny that would have once forced them to do things differently. The result is a world ruled by pharma companies, where your worth is basically measured by how much you can contribute to science. Society is virtually divided into two groups: those who experiment, and those who are experimented on. <br/><br/>Allegra is an orphan -a classic victim of Vespra's cruel social divide. With nothing going for her, she spends her days trying to keep afloat as a dealer of black market hallucinogens. Like many others, she pines for an escape to the Blues -the illustrious business district filled with the promises of prosperity and opportunity, but she knows her dream is hopeless.<br/><br/>One day, a chance encounter with Alastair -the heir to a rising biotech company, creates an opportunity for Allegra that she latches on to. With nothing to lose, she pours herself into the fantasy that he presents her with, not stopping for one second to consider the consequences of her actions. In her relentless pursuit of a new life Allegra forgets something very important: that lies are all around us, and a lot of what has been done can never be undone.</p>

<p>It's time for my favorite characters to return! Careful, spoilers to book 1 ahead!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What happened in book 1:</p>
<p>""Griffins' Promise"" is the sequel to ""Griffins' Medaillon"" in which teenage girl Charly accidentally entered Area, the world of griffins, and was transformed into a griffin herself. Although she was a felide, a cat-griffin, and not even a real one, she fell in love with repellent canide - wolf-griffin - Lero. It took her a while to get him unbend, but finally they made a couple welded together like Area had never seen before. And although she managed to survive and made it back to her own world, Charly finally decided to return to Area and stay with Lero.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What happens in book 2:</p>
<p>Sonja, Charly's best friend and a teenager like she has once been, can't leave the past behind. Although the police stopped asking her about the events few months ago, she can't forget Charly who decided to become a griffin in Area forever. When Sonja walks to where her friend jumped to the portal between both worlds, she finds the medaillon Zyrion that now is broken and turned its colour to black. She's shocked about finding it, but tries to hide it. When her mother nearly finds out about the medaillon, Sonja panics - and suddenly she's in Area, the broken medaillon in her hand. But she hasn't been turned into a griffin like Charly.</p>
<p>Good luck it's Derion, Lero's old mentor, who finds her first. With his help, she gets to Charly, who is shocked to find her in this world. But also Sonja is troubled to recognise her old friend in her griffin's shape.</p>
<p>Danger's not over. Not only does Charly have to find a way to bring Sonja back home with the broken medaillon's help - also Zyrion absorbed bad and dark energy since it was damaged. This energy lets the dark avide griffin who stole the medaillon thousands of years ago return as a shadow-shaped, caught in his burning whish for revenge. Together, Charly, Lero and Sonja have to find a way to destroy the dark shadow and bring Sonja back home, as well as care for lonely wolf-griffin puppy Kibubi whom they find on their way. And Sonja and Charly have to find out whether their friendship can last between two races as well as two worlds ...</p>

<p>Echoes was published by Storm Moon Press as 'Aliens, Smith and Jones' in July 2012.<br/><br/>Official blurb:<br/><br/>Connor Smith works for Primrose, an organization tasked with monitoring and tracking aliens and alien technology. It’s a job that doesn’t know the meaning of “nine-to-five”. It also doesn’t leave much room for a social life, a complication that Connor hasn’t minded, until now. At the prodding of his best friend, Connor reluctantly puts himself back in the dating pool, even though it means lying about his remarkable life.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Noah Jones has led a remarkable life of his own. Stranded on Earth in 1648, Noah was forced to transform himself permanently into human form to survive. He soon learned that in doing so, he’d become effectively immortal, aging only at a glacial pace. Alone, with no way to contact his people or return home, Noah becomes a silent observer of human civilization — always in the world, but never of the world. Then, hundreds of years later, he sees a face in a crowd and instantly feels a connection that he thought he’d never feel again. But he’s too late: Connor’s already taken.<br/><br/>Destiny is not without a sense of humor, though, and the two men are pulled inexorably closer, snared by the same web of dangers and conspiracies. Worse, Primrose is now aware of Noah, and they aren’t ones to leave an alien unrestrained. So while Connor struggles to understand the strange pull he feels toward Noah, forces without as well as within are working against them to keep them apart.<br/><br/>More info at: http://blainedarden.com/books/aliens-smith-and-jones</p>

<p><em>Talk about  a cold case.</em></p>
<p>Ambitious lawyer Philip Draken is eager to make his name with a high profile case and this might just be it. He's hired by the son of a man in cryonic stasis to fight a bid by the frozen man's wife...widow...whatever...to have him removed from stasis. But cryostasis is a one way ticket as the technology for safe revival doesn't exist yet. Being taken from stasis means certain death. Some people argue that the frozen are dead already, mere corpsicles whose preservation steals resources from the living and Philip discovers there are well financed pressure groups ranged against him and his client.</p>
<p>As he refines his arguments for the case Philip seeks the advice of a philosophy professor Rishi Rangarajan, a man who quickly  becomes a friend, and Philip starts to hope for perhaps something more. But the case suddenly becomes more personal, when Philip's chronically ill father announces his plan to go into cryostatis. Philip is forced to confront his own feelings about whether the frozen are alive or dead. The court case is no longer a game to be won. It's a fight to set a legal precedent to protect his own father.</p>

<p>So what's a guy like me to do when he's stuck a decade in the past, anyway? Enjoy the release of the final Harry Potter movie all over again? As fun as it sounds, I want to get home. So, I found the one person who I think will be able to help me - a teenage girl who is homophobic, devoutly Christian, a picky eater, and, at times, a bit of a spoiled princess. In other words, everything I'm not. It's okay though, because I know she doesn't really mean any of that.</p>
<p>How do I know that? Because once upon a time, I was her... literally.</p>

<p>Based very strongly on my own personal experience in high school, this book addresses mental illness, and what's it like to live with (and hide) a serious mental disorder. Part of my aim with Feed the Rain is to show readers that people with mental illnesses are just people, not dangerous, or murderous. Just confused and scared.</p>

About to be sold to the highest bidder, Ali makes a break for it, and soon finds herself alone in the city of demons.

<p>Bard Company is the project name for a fantasy series that I started during last year's NaNoWriMo. It all started when I was trying to come up with an interesting and unusual cover for an assassin, and decided that a bard would be awesome because they can travel, get into all sorts of places, and I've always had a soft spot for bards. <br/><br/>Then I started wondering how this bard became an assassin, and suddenly my story went from being about a 20 something bard assassin, to being about a 10 year old boy. Oops. It has since morphed into a novel series about a group of eight kids as they go through a bard academy. Learning, growing, and eventually, joining the revolution. For magic has been outlawed and a church (which I'm calling the Holy Shit until I come up with a real name) has arisen that holds the continent in a stranglehold. Only their holy prophet (or maybe god?) is actually a magician that's found a way to make himself immortal (essentially), and the priesthood controls what magic is actually allowed on the continent, disguised as the work of prayer and intersession from god(?). <br/><br/>This can't be allowed to continue. <br/><br/>Last year I wrote 50,000 words of what was mainly backstory. For only one of the characters. Oops? (I say that a lot) It's been a rough year so I haven't gotten to work on the project much. As I head into this year I have a good handle on four of the main characters, sketchy ideas for two more, and two left to figure out. I plan on starting with finishing figuring out those characters, writing a little bit (hopefully) of backstory for the characters I don't know as well and, if all goes well, actually starting Bard Academy Year One. We'll see what actually happens. <br/><br/>(oh please, please, don't morph drastically again. i'm begging here guys, i'm the author and you are just the characters remember? don't give me that look! gah! really, i'm supposed to have some control of this project guys. Adair, what are you doing here, you don't even belong in my novel, you belong in Meri's!)<br/><br/>(oh dear sweet stars above, i'm going to need a lot of coffee to survive this)<br/><br/>Ahem, sorry, already-losing-my-brain author moment there.

<p>The continent of Zeria was under the thumb of a religion known as the Holy Shit*. Even Kings and Queens had to follow their edicts, and they were in charge of education in all the lands. They even had control of what songs and stories the bards were allowed to teach. The people were taught that magic was just a myth, as were any magical creatures, or magical races, that they had ever heard of. It was all a lie.</p><p>One day a boy named Rorykai, who was training to be a bard, learned the truth of what was behind The Holy Shit, and his life changed forever. He joined the underground resistance, and they saw potential in him to become an assassin and a spy. As a bard he could travel. He could gather information from the servants that were always chatty, and occasionally take out key people for the resistance. It was time to fight back, it was time to bring magic and the old gods back to the people, and Rorykai is going to do everything in his power to help make it happen.<br/><br/>*The Holy Shit is being used as a place holder until I figure out what I'm actually going to call the religion. </p>

<p>In order to restore peace after the Dawn of Dae, the United States has declared martial law. Enforcing the militant regime won't be easy, and a new policing force of dae and their bonded humans has been mustered to keep the populace under tight control.</p>
<p>Alexa wants nothing to do with the government, it's army, or the special forces meant to keep rebellion at bay, but she has a choice: do what Kenneth Smith wants, or die a quick death. As one of the unawakened, she has no chance of infiltrating the police on her own. Forced to partner with Kenneth's dae, who dislikes her almost as much as she dislikes it, her life hinges on how well she convinces others she's a big, bad monster just like them instead of an ordinary human woman.</p>
<p>Woking for the police is no easier than dealing with Kenneth's work. During the day, she's a part of the law, but at night, she's a tool of crime and war. It's only a matter of time before she's caught--or fails her mission and is killed by her drug-dealing boss.</p>
<p>If she wants to live a free life, she'll need to take care of Kenneth once and for all. Since he won't listen to reason and let her go, she's determined to buy her freedom with his death.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Kenneth isn't the only problem in her life, and unless she does something about Rob, she'll lose the independence she fought so hard for. Worse, unless she's careful, he'll make her like it...</p>

<p>The Mayans predicted the end (and beginning) of an era on 12/21/12.  Izzy Wall doesn't see much change, or ""transformation"" (as promised by the new-agers) in the world around her, but she thinks she might feel something shifting within her.  See, Izzy is her own worst enemy.  She's in a constant battle with herself.  She thinks her natural inclinations are weaknesses to be fought, because they're unacceptable to her family.  She's convinced that she can't live her dreams without crushing her parents - it seems like it's always a choice between them and her.  </p>
<p>But then Izzy meets Michelle Stone, who challenges all of her beliefs and makes anything seem possible.  This is Izzy's journey to seeing just what is possible, to finding which dreams actually can find their way into the real world, and learning to live with her imperfect self as she fumbles along.</p>
