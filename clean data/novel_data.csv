1,Nicaless,Novel: A Mystery in the Kingdom of Aermon,Genre: Fantasy,50919,"1,697",1,"
<p>Hitoshi is appointed the youngest Judge and master of the Veris Saber in the history of Aermon.  His new responsibilities may prove to be a bit more challenging than he first anticipated.  It certainly does not help that he's standing trial for murder...  </p>

<p>This story, funnily enough, started out as a history textbook.   An academic at heart, I always knew I wanted to leave something behind for future students of the world.  However, while trying to engross myself in the process of writing history, I was swept away in the process of making it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The events described in the following collection of newspaper article, letters, diary entries, etc., that I have procured over the years and arranged like so for this book/website(?), tell a story of magic and mystery, of science and disbelief, of treachery and thievery, of love and war. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It may sound cliché.  It may sound like you have heard it before.  And it does.  And you have.  Such is history.  May you enjoy it all the same. </p>

<p>Sun withered hands work the earth with expert knowledge and care. The sun hits Bruja Verde's silver curls that hug the frame of her joyfully aged face. It has been too long since long since she last she had dug her fingerprints into the rich soil of the garden. Her eyes glistened holding a million snapshots of the pieces of earth she had touched. Although the woman was a passionate vessel of wanderlust, she was weak to the overwhelming force that called her back to this small piece of land. She had walked all of earths soils and touched leaves on every continent, but always found herself back in this place digging into the ground in hopes of filling her fingertips with enough soil to feel home again. She says that there is no place on earth where plants grow quite as beautifully as here, in the thick warm air and moist clay soil. In her garden there is no hierarchy. As she cares for and blesses the earth with her powers of nourishing and care, so tierra madre cares for and nourishes her. The garden is lush and green overflowing with abundance of fruits, vegetables, and flowers. La Bruja Verde casts all of her power and energy into the ground, and in return is gifted the sweetest of life elixers. She is strong as earth, and just as beautiful. Her eyes crinkle in the corners like her pumpkins when they are beginning the transition from fruit to earth, and her cheek bones strong as the roots of a fig tree.</p>
<p>It is said that la Bruja Verdetierra, was born into a strong family that founded the central city. When she was young, her sisters chased comfort and material joys, bouncing between the family members with the greatest wealth. La bruja verde prefered to stay with her grandmother, who would sit in her chair and sew and pat masa in her hands to make tortillas. When she wasn't watching her grandmother, she could be found with the plants marveling at their beauty sometimes singing to them. They say that Tierra madre ( the womb from which land was born) made saw that she was not an ordinary child. She made la Bruja Verde her apprentice, showed her how to use the powers within her, to connect with earth and call forth plants. La Bruja Verde soon was able to call on the earth dust (from which all people come from) within her, and stir la magia verde (the green magic) that women like her have cultivated for generations under the careful guidance of Tierra Madre. As she grew in age, so she did in strength and knowledge of el mundo verde (the green world). Not only could she use her calloused fingers call forth plants from the espiritus de la tierra (spirits of the earth), but she also learned to accept those offerings of the earth and use them as healing, magic, and blessings for the people of her town.</p>

<p>Instead of a single manuscript, this year I'm going to be trying to reach a total of 50k for three different projects, two of which are incomplete Camp Nanowrimo books...<br/><br/>A Witch of Arion: From the time she first heard a little boy calling out 'Come see the witch, get your fortune told' at the fair, Nashua knew she'd become a witch. She runs away from home, joins the fair, and ends up trapped in the tower of an evil witch with a cruel demon. But an unlikely alliance of good witches and fair folk rescue her and help her contact the Voice of the Looking Glass, who arbitrates the Three Challenges for Nashua to sever the psychic link the demon still has on her. (Camp manuscript from August 2012)<br/><br/>The Aurigae Express: When a scam artist slips the Global Police net and escapes to an alien trading planet, Alan Sinclair, mild-mannered forensic accountant volunteers to become Earth's first extra-solar Fugitive Retrieval Marshal. Along with Diane Stewart, (don't call her Dixie!) he travels to the domed city of Argos, where Earthlings are an obscure minority and only the laws that all species can agree on are enforced!

<p>""You have to do whatever you can to disrupt this brainwave link,"" a man of about Stevens' age said. Brett wasn't sure what his role was on the ship, but knew that he'd been part of the Space Force - a military man who was used to the notion of taking direct action to promote the safety of planet Earth.<br/><br/>""Without knowing in advance what the effects of such a disruption?"" the doctor shot back. ""I wouldn't advise that.""<br/><br/>""You don't know the effects of leaving her in this state for any longer!""<br/><br/>""That's not true,"" the doctor said. ""We can't be sure of the psychological impact until she wakes, admittedly, but phsyiologically the brain is not being harmed. In fact, from the scans that the medic - excuse me, that Ensign Peterson was able to forward, the state appears to lie somewhere between alpha sleep and REM...""<br/><br/>""So she's dreaming?"" Colin broke in. ""Sorry, sir, I didn't mean to interrupt.<br/><br/>""No, that's quite all right, Lieutenant,"" the Captain told him. ""The five of you are on the spot, so this is your show until Discovery can reach low orbit at least. If any of you Ensigns have input, please speak up.""<br/><br/>Brett decided that this was his moment. ""Sir, I believe that at least some of us should follow the alien's unspoken invitation and follow Melissa into the crystal sphere. Or, allow them to bring our brainwaves inside, whatever that ends up meaning.""<br/><br/>""Really?"" Stevens paused. ""Is that you, Walker?""<br/><br/>""Yes, captain.""<br/><br/>""There's no denying that this is risky, Ensign,"" the captain continued. ""I wouldn't order anybody into an inscrutable danger like that. But I think I'm starting to believe you that it's our best chance. So this is where I call for volunteers.""<br/><br/>""I'll be happy to volunteer, sir,"" Brett said.<br/><br/>""I wouldn't think of letting anyone else go in without me, sir,"" Archer chimed in immediately.<br/><br/>""Very good,"" Stevens said. ""You were the two that they asked for. Does anybody else want to present themselves, and see if the aliens find them worthy to join in?""<br/><br/>There was a moment's pause. ""If I were in tip-top condition, I'd be sure to volunteer, sir,"" Jody said. ""But the symptoms of Kane syndrome are getting worse. Presumably weakness of the body won't directly affect my performance in a mental exercise, but...""<br/><br/>""Petersen, could you give Ensign Quinton a quick scan with the portable imager and send me the results immediately?"" the doctor asked, and Gary hurried to get it ready.<br/><br/>""I'll volunteer myself, sir,"" Exec told the captain. ""Unless you think that as ranking officer of the mission, it's my duty to remain unaffected by this.""<br/><br/>""Nonsense, Commander Zehethoffer,"" Stevens said. ""Your duty is to do whatever's necessary to establish contact with the natives. I think that you can best do that from inside the damned crystal ball.""<br/><br/>""I understand, sir. Then my offer to volunteer stands.""<br/><br/>""I can't think of anybody better to carry out the mission, Yvonne,"" Stevens said, and Brett nearly broke out laughing from the incongruity of the Captain referring to Exec by her first name. He'd heard her surname before, but none of his friends had even been able to find out about 'Yvonne' from the computer records.<br/><br/>Gary finished off making the scan of Jody's condition, and in just a few seconds the doctor cleared his throat. ""Yes, I'd have significant concerns with Quinton perticipating even if she'd volunteered. She's not too close to critical harm with adequate care, but undergoing the brainwave transfer might be a strain to her autonomic system, and if she were unconscious, then the caregiver would be unable to diagnose her condition as well, with - um, with the patient unresponsive.""<br/><br/>""And that gives me my decision, too,"" Gary said. ""Like it or lump it, I'm the caregiver. It's my job to keep Jody alive until you guys break through the inter-species gap, and tell these alien guys that we need help bad. Who knows, maybe I'll need to keep you alive too, by the time it's over.""<br/><br/>Somebody on the conference muttered about 'that fool hotshot pilot's attitude,' but Brett could hardly blame his good friend for speaking freely without asking permission. Gary had to be jealous right now - he'd have loved to get into this whole brainwave thing, but felt that he couldn't volunteer honorably. And although he wasn't as sure, Brett wondered if Gary was afraid as well - afraid that all the rest of them would die here, despite anything that he could do.<br/><br/>So he walked up and offered Gary his hand. ""Thanks, man. It means so much to know that you'll be staying behind and watching our backs.""<br/><br/>""Yeah. Get the job done, superstar."" Gary slapped his hand in friendly fashion.<br/><br/>""Okay, that would appear to settle your team's strategy,"" Stevens said. ""There's one other thing that I'd like your input on, Exec - and your junior officers, as well, if they have input. If we reach orbit and there's no progress on project Brainwave, where should Discovery go?""<br/><br/>Exec considered. ""What's your ETA for orbit?""<br/><br/>There was a moment as Stevens called up to the bridge to get an update. ""Twenty-two hours, nineteen minutes, standard time.""<br/><br/>""Then, if we're stuck in the crystal ball with nothing to show for it, I'd consider this entire area - a unpromising avenue,"" Exec said. ""Send short-range shuttles to the space hibitates, and - and land Discovery in a spot as close to the far side of the planet as seems promising, I don't know.""<br/><br/>""Well, thank you for your suggestion. Any other thoughts?"" Brett considered it, and mumbled no. Gary, Jody, and Colin all answered 'No, sir' one at a time.<br/><br/>""Then thank you, and best of fortune to you all,"" the Captain said.<br/><br/>""Aye, sir,"" Exec replied, and broke the connection.<br/><br/>#<br/><br/>Gary checked to make sure that Jody would be okay for a little while, and followed them all out to meet their alien destiny. Exec turned to face them when they were twenty meters away.<br/><br/>""Let me approach them by myself to start, and try the sign language gambit,"" she suggested. ""I'm curious about how they'll react before knowing that either of you are agreeing too.""<br/><br/>""Okay. Do you want to carry your own chair?"" Colin offered. They'd found folding chairs in the small cargo section of the Gaia's Hope, and decided sitting down would be a dignified way of waiting while their brainwaves were taken away.<br/><br/>""Yes, of course."" Exec took the chair that Colin offered her, walked over to the nearest native, and then pointed at her own head, then into the platonic solids model. They eagerly got their metal rods out, and were about to zap her right away before one of them seemed to notice what she was doing in unfolding the chair and sitting on it. Then the chair seemed to completely monopolize their attention.<br/><br/>""Why's it so interesting to them?"" Colin asked. ""They have a table, why not chairs?""<br/><br/>""Tables are something that you can use no matter what your body is shaped like,"" Brett said, stepping cautiously forward. ""But how would guys with three legs use a chair? Think about it.""<br/><br/>Before they got there, Exec had slumped into the chair. ""Okay, they got her brainwaves too,"" Colin said. ""Who volunteers next?""<br/><br/>""You can go, if you want to,"" Brett said. ""I'll bring up the rear.""<br/><br/>""Actually, I had one idea,"" Gary said. ""I brought the brainwave scanner, and though that it might be a good idea to record what's going on step by step.""<br/><br/>""Yes, good thinking, Peterson,"" Colin agreed. ""Scan the exec, and Brett - see if you can get them to present the sphere in scanning position again. Then Peterson can scan it with two sets of brainwaves inside, and three, and all four - and all of us as we go in.""<br/></p>

<p>Brandon programmed the rocar for HQ.  Ellen and Brandon rode in silence until her computab beeped, signaling an incoming call.  It was Parkin.  She put him on speaker.<br/>“I’m here at HQ with Cayley,” he said.  “And we’ve got something to show you.  Sending video now.”  <br/>Ellen waited for the prompt, tapped the code sequence to receive the secure video transmission.  She held the tablet so Brandon could see as well.  <br/>The video opened to show Tommy Knudsen standing next to Cayley Berriton in one of the SIS interview rooms.  The video surveillance cameras in those rooms hadn’t been upgraded to holovision yet, and the image looked flat to Ellen’s eyes.  They were facing the table, on which was a large bulky object:  a dead pig.  Tommy was wearing the distinctive blue-on-blue jumpsuit of an SIS detainee; his own clothing would have been confiscated for forensic analysis.<br/>“You want me to hit that?”  Tommy was asking.<br/>“Yes, I do,” Cayley said.<br/>“But why?”<br/>“Well, it’s like this.  Our agents told you that Alex Armin’s injury couldn’t have been inflicted by a punch.  And that’s true, at least for any punch I’ve ever heard of.  But it doesn’t seem like there was time for anyone else to have killed him, which would suggest you must have done it.  And you say you didn’t have a weapon.  So you must have killed him with your fist.  Even though that seems impossible.”  She talked breathlessly, in staccato sentences; Ellen realized the junior investigator must have been nervous.  <br/>“That’s ridiculous,” Tommy said.<br/>“Well, I figure we can solve it right now.  Go ahead.  Hit the pig.  It’s already dead, you can’t hurt it.”<br/>“I don’t want to hit the pig.”<br/>“Just hit the pig, okay?  Humor me.”  She smiled.  She had a charming smile.<br/>Tommy looked around.  “This is stupid,” he said.  But he made a fist and swung it at the pig, halfheartedly.<br/>“No, no.  Hit the pig like you really mean it.  Like you’re really mad at it.  Like you were mad at Alex Armin the other day.  As hard as you can.”<br/>Tommy just stared at the pig.<br/>“Come on.  Pretend it’s Alex.  Pretend he just beat up his girlfriend.  Can you picture that bruise on Jennica’s face?”<br/>Tommy got tense.  Not just his face, his entire body, perceptible even on camera.<br/>“Yeah, that’s it.  Alex Armin, who hurts pretty girls who never did anything.”  <br/>Ellen couldn’t be sure, but she thought she saw something change in Tommy’s eyes.  “Goddamn him,” Tommy hissed through clenched teeth.  He hurled a punch at the pig.<br/>Was that a flash of light?  No, it couldn’t have been—but a dark stain started to appear on the flank of the dead pig.  Cayley was staring at it, her eyes getting wider, her mouth hanging open.  Tommy was shaking out his hand.  “Satisfied?” he asked.<br/>Cayley just pointed at the pig.  Tommy looked.  “What the …?”  Then: “Did I do that?”<br/>Cayley nodded.  The video froze.<br/>“We checked the pig,” Parkin said.  “It had exactly the same type of tissue damage as Armin’s body.”  The screen went dark.<br/>“That’s impossible,” Brandon said.  “It’s got to be some kind of trick.”<br/></p>

Stitches tried to help, he knew that, but it didn’t mean he wanted it.  Any of it.  Advice on Claire was one thing, but the topic of his mother was something completely different.

<p>The day they put my husband to death, I wore silk.</p>
<p>They say that the smells are the perceptions most likely to stay carved in the memory, but what I remember most from that day is touch. The silk dress, the way it caressed my body with my every move. It soothed, cooled, consoled, like a breeze on a hot summer day.</p>
<p>I still remember to the smallest detail what I wore that day. The black silk dress barely reached my knees, so scandalously short it was. The buttons were small and round, like children’s tears. It had a long ribbon around the neck that I tied into a bow. I wore black shoes with velvet bows on them, and I took a pink clutch bag. It gave it the right theatrical touch. After all, it was all a big theatre for which I was given tickets I couldn‘t refuse.</p>
<p>They abolished public executions a long time ago. They have become a private, almost intimate thing. They only require one member of the family to be present at the execution. Even though the whole family usually comes, they can leave after they say goodbye. One person has to stay until the end. It‘s a formality, they say. For me, it is a part of the punishment - maybe more cruel than the actual death penalty and everything that follows.</p>
<p>What they say about the smells must be wrong indeed, because I don’t remember what the room smelled like. Maybe it didn’t have a smell of its own, maybe it was just a blank canvas for the blend of our perfumes, the scent of rain we brought with us, so inappropriate because it was alive. It was a reminder of the world outside that wouldn’t end after this was over, that would still turn when he would be gone. When we would be gone. And maybe there was a hint of the officer’s cologne as he moved closer.</p>
<p>“<span>Have you agreed on the witness?” he asked.</span></p>
<p>It was then that I realized we hadn’t talked about it. Ever. There was no family meeting, no spoken agreement. There was no need for it.</p>
<p>“<span>I will be staying, sir,” I said.</span></p>
<p>He gave me a surprised look and I think he didn’t feign it. Usually the wives are not the ones to stay. Not when there are others that could stay – the father, older brother, another male relative. There were five of us in the room, but I wouldn’t ask any one of them to take that place instead of me. Certainly not his mother or sister, and certainly not Daniel, the youngest one. As for my other brother-in-law, I barely knew him. He worked in a different city and only came here because of what happened and what was to follow. When I thought about it, we were a group of strangers only united by this singular event.</p>
<p>The officer turned to them. His voice was quiet and calm, almost sympathetic. It was neither affected nor honest. I think it was simply his professional voice that he wasn’t even conscious of anymore. “You have to leave now.”</p>
<p>They all nodded in the resigned way of people who have given up hope a long time ago. Except for Daniel. He threw himself at his older brother with the desperation of a fifteen years old boy whose life fell apart in one single minute, whose dreams, chances, ambitions and future loves slipped through his fingers when the judge read the sentence. There was an unspoken question in the way he clinched to him, a question he didn’t want to speak out loud because it would sound like a reproach.</p>
<p>“<span>You have to leave now.”</span></p>
<p>The voice of the officer was still the same. He sounded like a machine that repeats the same thing every two minutes until you get so angry that you smash it.</p>
<p>The door opened with a buzz. My mother-in-law immediately headed to it, like she was only waiting for it to open again, as if she couldn’t wait to be out of there. As if everything that was happening would become just a nightmare when she would exit that room. Her oldest son and daughter followed her without a word. Again, Daniel decided to take another side. Our side, if we had one.</p>
<p>“<span>I will stay.” </span></p>
<p>“<span>No.” It was the first word my husband said that day. Simple and resolute. But Daniel didn’t move an inch.</span></p>
<p>“<span>I will stay with you.”</span></p>
<p>I didn’t know if he meant only him or us both, but none of us argued anymore. There was some desperate, foolish bravery in those words - childish naivety, hope that such a decision could change something.</p>
<p>I waited until then with my goodbye. A light kiss on the lips, nothing more. No words, there was nothing unsaid between us. If there was anything we didn’t do while we had the chance, it couldn’t be done in the last minute anyway.</p>
<p>The door closed quietly and, for a moment, everything was quiet, almost peaceful, like it was already over. At that moment, Daniel’s eyes darted to the door, like he would give anything to be behind it. I did the only thing that I could do. I wrapped my arms around him and let him hide his face in the black silk of my dress like a mother shelters her child from things he shouldn’t yet see or know. He was no longer a child but was also too young to know about death and pain. Even though he was to know about them, if not now, then soon.</p>
<p>My eyes didn’t leave my husband’s for a moment. He was calm and composed. There was something eerie in that calmness, something distant. It was transmissible, too. I had thought I would cry, scream, launch myself at them, I had thought I would try to stop them. I didn‘t.</p>
<p>I stood there motionless, watched them insert the needle in his vein and let them take him away from me forever.</p>

<p>I could hear the steps behind me, two pairs of shoes, the peculiar sound they made on the wet sidewalk. I forced myself not to turn around. <br/><br/>Maybe I expected it. I wasn't that naive to think all those Riccardo could turn in would remain sitting at home, waiting for the police to come. And I had to acknowledge that it was easier to get to me than to get to him.<br/><br/>I quickened my pace. I was wearing high heels, so running was out of question. I started to think that those who were pursuing me didn't want to kill me. At least not now.

A dark-haired man maybe a few years older than me was smiling at me from the back seat.

But now I didn't even need such instinct. It was sticking out a mile who he was.<br/><br/>""I don't want to intrude, but maybe you would like to get in,"" he said calmly.<br/><br/>I knew it was out of the frying pan into the fire.

<p>I got up from the chair and walked over to the stand. I took my bow and came to Madame Laverna. She handed me an arrow and smiled encouragingly. I recognized the arrowhead I had made myself. I was the only one to make a broadhead with four blades, like the ones used for war. They could penetrate the armour and they killed quickly. At least for that I was grateful.<br/>   I set the arrow on the bowstring and took the right position. Riccardo was looking at me with a spaced-out look, his eyes veiled and pupils large. Altae. That was their act of mercy.<br/>   My hands felt cold and clammy. I wished it was me with altae running in my blood now.<br/>   I breathed in and breathed out slowly. With the next intake of breath I pulled the bowstring. I breathed out and released the arrow. It sank into the sand barely five feet from me. I heard the whispers around me and I knew I had to explain.<br/>""I cannot fulfill this task!"" I said, my voice resonating strangely between the walls.<br/>I turned to Madame Laverna, who was tentatively handing me the second arrow.<br/>""I am able to kill, I know I am. But I cannot prove it to you here and now. I can kill an enemy or a stranger. But I cannot kill a friend. I don't want the second chance. No need to waste another arrow.""<br/>I slipped the opal ring off my finger and handed it to Madame Laverna. I wanted to apologize, but the words never came out. I simply didn't know what I should apologize for.<br/>""Is this your final decision, Yvaine?"" she asked.<br/>I glanced at Riccardo. Then I looked at all the faces in the row. Margot and Briella were smiling scornfully. Lucetta and Loretta looked almost terrified, Etta seemed utterly confused. The rest of the faces were blank, except for Imani's.

<p>Lionel was sitting on the wooden boxes behind the big top, red cigarette light shining between his fingers. He looked at me and for a while it seemed like he was hesitating whether to pretend that he didn't see me or not.<br/>""Paloma!"" he called on me finally.<br/>I turned around.<br/>""Be careful!"" he said. ""Paolo isn't someone you'd want to be friends with.""<br/>""Oh really?"" I snapped. ""And who is? Who wants to be friends with someone here?""<br/>He shrugged and let me be. I entered our van, undressed myself in the dark and lay on the bed. Lionel's words were echoing in my head, and even more my answer to them.<br/>   I realized that I was doing it because I finally had some vague feeling that I belonged to someone here. Because I felt the lack of intimacy and I needed some relationship. I needed to be connected to someone here. And I needed it so desperately, that I didn't mind that it was Paolo and that the connection between us was the fact that I was secretly helping him to inject heroin and that because of him I spent a night walking through a street where grown-up men didn't dare to go even by day.<br/>   I was sixteen and I needed to feel important, wanted, desired, all that I wasn't. And Paolo was offering me that illusion. I felt important when he was telling me all the half-sarcastic compliments, and how he was touching me sometimes was persuading me that I was desired. Or, rather I was persuading myself. It was strange because I knew that even if he wanted me, which I doubted, I wouldn't allow it. But the slightly provocative touches felt good. It was something like my drug that was helping me to survive. It was suddenly easier to put up with Igor's scolding, Carmen's vicious remarks, the tension and stress in the ring when I knew that at the end of the day I would come for my little recognition, that I would feel important for half an hour during our ritual and that someone would touch me at least a bit tenderly.<br/>   I had been waiting all my life to find my place here, and I wasn't going to let anyone take it from me.<br/></p>

The creatures they created are soulless, ravaging monsters who kill every human they can find, and within just a few weeks more than 85% of the human population is eradicated, cities destroyed, the blue planet a wasteland. The beginning of these terrible times is known as Break Down After World, and every 1,000 years the calendars are reset to remember this day. <br/><br/>But hope is still strong, for the destruction by the dragonlike creatures that are henceforth known as Draconia is followed by the revelation of planet earth's real Dragons - kind, gentle and magical beings that can take on human forms. What is left of the human race divides into colonies - hiding from the Draconia - and the 25 bases around the world, a military organization set out to destroy the rapidly multiplying Draconia with help of the Dragons, which need human companions as switches in order to control their dragon fire while in dragon form, known as Dragon Riders. Two rider-and-dragon pairs serve each of the 25 bases respectively, protecting the people and looking for ways to end this reign of terror.<br/><br/>90,000 years later, a team from Base 9 discovers the in an iceberg off (what used to be known as) Greenland frozen sleeping body of a young woman.

Not long after, Halían, a Dragon who hasn't found his Dragon Rider yet and has been forced to live in his human form for the last 900 years, is transferred from Base 16 to Base 9 (he's been switched around the bases every decade) to be watched over. When Lily and Halían finally touch one day, Halían's dragonstone cuffs break and free him from his human shape, making him able to take on his real form for the first time since he received his dragon fire on his 100th birthday, revealing Lily as his destined Dragon Rider. From now on, the pair serves Base 9 - which has been the only base with only one rider-and-dragon pair instead of two - along with Base 9's original pair, the Dragon Jar'esh and his rider Molly.<br/><br/>Their fight against the Draconia begins...</p>

<p>""Poor girl, way too young to die,"" a female voice said somewhere to her right.<br/>Valerye tried to lift herself up, only to realize that she didn't have any feeling in her body. Anxiety washed over her. Move! she screamed at her muscles, panic starting to swallow her mind. Finally, her upper body jerked, causing the people around her to scream in surprise. With a gasp, her lungs sucked in a handful of air—only to realize that the sensation didn't bring them any relief. She held her breath and waited for the familiar choking feeling that signaled her body it needed oxygen. It didn't come.<br/></p>

<p><br/>Chapter 1<br/><br/>“Come on, keep it moving! Badges out and in plain view, everyone!” <br/><br/>There is a huge attendance at WaukeeCon, Milwaukee’s premiere anime convention. So much activity is going on there that the biggest buzz outside any Hollywood movie premiere could ever hope to have just keeps the otaku and cosplaying droves coming left and right. Those same crowds seem to be heading to one place and one place only-the voice actors autograph signing. It just never seems to stop. A whole lot of pushing, pulling, shouting, screaming, coughing, glomping, posing, flashing and photo snapping, it seems to be happening all at once. The few security guards on staff, really only two of them, are making weak attempts to control the crowds and the lines to the VA autograph table. Now, if there were any time that a fucking catastrophic, aneurismal event was about to go down, this would definitely be it. <br/><br/>The monstrous crowds of otaku, game freaks and cosplayers run back and forth all over the place. They trip all over themselves trying to get to a certain special ballroom in the Milwaukee Convention Center. All are oblivious to the somewhat imposing figure that they are constantly running and bumping into. Like savage winds blowing through a moveable forest, one mighty tree is standing tall and strong, refusing to bend or break from the taut force. <br/><br/>“Come on! The lines are growing! The lines are growing!”<br/>“And, uh, who gave us the wrong fucking time of the VA signing?!”<br/>“What the hell. Somebody smells in this crowd.”<br/>“Is Treg Mondol gonna be here?”<br/><br/>While the crowds get bigger by the minute, the imposing figure finally decides to start making his way to the growing lines that are snaking out of Ballroom A, more than likely the largest ballroom that could possibly accommodate the hellish throng that threatens to push its way through to the other side of paradise. Somehow, the tall creature that looms forth manages to cut his way in line near towards the front, allowing him to actually see above the sea of heads that tries to block his vision. There in the near distance, a long, black draped table beckons otaku and cosplayers as far as the eye could see. Almost at the ballroom’s wide open doors, he stands and waits patiently-and impatiently-for the line he‘s in to at least budge. <br/><br/>Some official looking dude comes out to control the flow of geeks who dare stampede their way in. The official dude kind of pushes and guides people who are trying to step out of line a little bit. Those same pushy people try to see what the hell’s going on and try to also catch a glimpse-any kind of glimpse-of their favorite voice actors. <br/>Ah, the magic moment is at hand, the figure silently thinks. <br/><br/>Inside Ballroom A, the mega large table, draped in black heavy cloth like some sort of prop for a Gothic Lolita function, continues beckoning the throngs that keep pushing their way towards five unimposing figures that seem ready to bless the oncoming onslaught of anime fans. Surrounding the five unassuming gods are various posters, merchandise and streamers of a nondescript anime series, which decorate the table. A few nerds of various sizes, ages and genders are buzzing around the table, making sure everything is in order and in its place. <br/><br/>The five gods at the table ready themselves for what looks like a marathon “blessing” of otaku and otome. One of the geeks, a heavyset woman, is leaning over and talking to an elderly woman seated at the very right end of the table. The woman seated next to her, a pretty African American, seems to not even belong there. The other three, a redheaded Irish looking girl, a big fat papa bear nerd and some middle aged jerk wad looking dude, take up the next three seats and converse for a bit, before the first of many fans excitedly sprint up to meet them all. <br/><br/>A guy in a cheap suit says a final word to a young geek outfitted with a headset of some sort, be-fore beckoning the anxious front of line fans to come forward, “but in an orderly fashion!” he barks. He then guides those lucky fans to the voice actors, who might be less than enthused to be meeting some of their more rabid ones. <br/><br/>While several fans, motioned to come forward for their coveted autographs, hightail it to the voice actors, all look over towards the pretty black woman seated almost at the other end of the table. Supposedly, the drill for most of them is to meet the “other” voice actors and get their John Hancocks and then scoot right on over to the black princess’ line and wait to meet her. <br/><br/>The figure has been in line for almost half an hour now, when he tries to amuse himself by reading the makeshift cardboard sign that trumpets one of the hottest anime shows in North America, Corico. All of its crudely drawn anime characters are falling all over the sign, with each one subliminally pointing to the names of the voice actors who give them, well, the squeaky childlike voices that delight the show’s fans each and every day that it airs on Cartoon Network. Mr. Figure trains his bright gray eyes on the one name that is his true obsession: Carin Wiley. Closing his eyes, he tries to recollect the beautiful face that has haunted him since his auto mechanic trade school days. <br/><br/><br/>One day, his last class of the day was released early and he had some time to kill before going in to work. He could never imagine that a simple stop inside a dingy, small gas station convenience store would change his life forever. <br/><br/>Mr. Figure stopped inside to grab a greasy lunch for work and an anime magazine to read along with it. On the cover was a show that he didn’t exactly care too much about at first, which was Corico. He found it childish and devoid of any semblance of a storyline, which often some anime creations simply do lack. Harbinger and Red Zanning are more to his liking. There is much more action to be had in those titles. <br/>As Mr. Figure flipped through the pages of the well worn publication, something or someone had caught his eye. <br/><br/>On the page that featured interviews with the voice actors and actresses of the often featured anime titles, a young and pretty African American face looked softly back up at him. Her deep and bright eyes seemed to beckon him. Her mysterious beauty, soft medium skin and faint, bewitching smile had entranced him. Instantly, Mr. Figure fell madly in love. It was as if he had become enraptured in a strange new world that he’d never seen nor have heard of before. <br/><br/><br/>The sudden rush of the other fans pushes him along in line. An event guard, dressed all too casually in a black heavy metal t-shirt and black jeans, bellows at the slowly moving lines of fans. <br/>“Come on, guys. Keep it steady, and moving. And don’t push me out of the way, or I will push back!” the guard screams. <br/><br/>Mr. Figure steps up to the ballroom doors, which were flung wide open to accommodate the rush of anxious people. The guard stops him by putting up a slight, pudgy hand bedecked with a cheap silver watch, which is probably broken. Mr. Figure snarls at the guard for impeding his way towards his beautiful anime goddess. But hey, at least he made it to the door.<br/><br/>A full hour has past by now, but the lines are starting to finally move a little faster. Mr. Figure is now in the queue line directly in front of the black velvet ropes that spaciously separate the anime voice gods from the hungry packs of fans that dare to break through the sacred barrier. Mr. Cheap Suit continues his duty of motioning the unending numbers of fans through the barrier. He also keeps a stern eye on the lucky ones who have made it through to the voice actors, while making sure no one freaks out too badly. <br/><br/>Mr. Figure takes a few short breaths, knowing the magic moment is near for him. He slowly dips his head down and to the left to catch an inkling of a glimpse of his true love, Carin. When she fails to fall into his line of sight, he switches peripherals by turning his dirty blonde head to the right. Aha! Success. He gets a clear view of Carin, who is excitedly, yet a bit tiredly, meeting all her fans, signing millions of autographs, shaking hands, handing out hugs and posing for pictures with many of them as if she were a real mega superstar. At least she is, to many of Corico’s followers, but most of all, to him. <br/><br/>The queue line continues to shrink, thanks in large part to Mr. Cheap Suit, who keeps the fans from taking up too much time with the Corico voicers so that everyone else in line can get their chance to meet them. Now there are only two people in front of Mr. Figure, which gives him the opportunity to finally prepare himself to meet his favorite and one true love, Carin. <br/><br/>The fans that are already at the table attempt to take up a bit more time meeting Carin and the others than anyone is allowed to. Mr. Figure busies himself, reading the names of all the other voice actors and actresses written on bright white folded cardboard nametags. <br/><br/>Seated at the far right end of the table is Barbara Waller, an aging voice actress. It seems she’s been around for years in the anime genre. Carin Wiley is of course seated next to her, on her left. <br/><br/>Purportedly the first African American voice actress regularly working in the anime medium today, Carin was relatively invisible because of the dearth of roles available for black actresses in anime series, or in any genre. Later in years she became a huge star in anime after being cast in Corico as the main character in the series named Rokio, a loopy, cheerful chibi princess that has endeared herself to the show’s viewers everywhere. <br/><br/>To Carin’s left is Mary Lauter, a fairly new player to the game of anime voicing. Mary doesn’t really stand out, except for her pale white skin and deep red wavy hair. <br/><br/>Bob Newell sits to Mary’s left, a stocky, gruff veteran voicer who seems to have been there and done that at one too many anime conventions. <br/><br/>The smug jerk wad at the end of the table is Jason Layman, a cocky son of a bitch if ever there was one. A rookie voicer, Jason sits leaning to one side, waiting for his few fans to come to him for his autograph, even though he’s totally unaware that his body language is giving off worse attitude than he even thinks. <br/><br/>At last, Mr. Figure’s moment has arrived. Mr. Cheap Suit motions him to the barrier that he must cut through to get to the table. Mr. Figure zooms right through it, making a beeline to Carin. Once there, he stops dead in his tracks and in front of her. He stands straight as if awaiting a command from the goddess, and fixes his mesmerized gaze on her. His heart is pounding and his breathing quickens as the very live sight of her takes him. It’s safe to say that he has completely forgotten all about the other voice actors, because only Carin has taken his full attention. <br/><br/>Standing there frozen in place, Mr. Figure takes several minutes to say anything to her. But, it just so happens that Carin had caught sight of this handsome, imposing man, and has become completely entranced by him as well.</p>

<p><strong>Downtown Los Angeles, 3:00pm</strong></p>
<p>Lysandra watched the steam from her coffee swirl in the afternoon sunlight. Her mind turned over all the possible explanations for the consistent smell of boiled cabbage that permeated the tiny cafe.</p>
<p>“So...” Matt sat down across from her with his usual glass of whole milk and chocolate a warmed chip cookie.</p>
<p>The Formica table they say at looked like it had been stolen from a fifties drive- in dinner. The small mom and pop type shop was directly across the street from the Department of Planetary Affairs building. When the DPA had fist moved into the neighborhood people were alarmed by their presence. The imposing uniforms with classified weapons and an association with the government intelligence and the mystique of dealing with aliens unnerved people.        Lysandra imagined this must be what it’s like to be a cop, a strangely contradictory position for her. The nervous looks and the way people moved out of the way for them wherever they went. She had never liked giving the authorities deference and she certainly did not like receiving it.</p>
<p>But now after months, the area workers and residents had gotten used to them and the interactions with public were usually positive. Putting names and faces with mysterious members of the DPA really helped people feel more comfortable with their presence. Most officers had gotten used to the impromptu question and answer sessions citizens asked them. Commander Draegg had been very pleased with this turn of events.</p>
<p>Matt cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Lysandra shook herself and took a sip from her coffee. “What were we talking about?”</p>
<p>“We weren’t. You’ve been suspiciously quiet all day.”</p>
<p>“What’s suspicious about it? You’re the one who usually does all of the talking anyway.”</p>
<p>“Not all of it. And yes, I have always been more talkative than you, but today it’s like you’re not even here.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’m distracted.”</p>
<p>“By...”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Uh, I wouldn’t call staying out all night nothing.”</p>
<p>Lysandra could feel the heat in her cheeks. She was not going to be discussing her sex life Matt of all people. The thought made her cringe. How many people knew she had been off the premises all night? Did it matter? She had never cared what people thought about her before, but it could make for awkward working relationships.</p>
<p>“Edward Drake asked me to marry him.”</p>
<p>Matt gagged on his milk and started coughing violently. Lysandra jumped up from her chair and got him a cup of water. She patted him on the back until he regained his composure. “Are you being serious?”</p>
<p>Lysandra nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“What any sane person would say, ‘we’re not going to talk about this.’”</p>
<p>“Uh- huh.” Matt turned in his chair to sit square with the table and held his milk at arm’s length, silent and unmoving.</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, how was your date?”</p>
<p>“Not yet, no changing the subject on me.” He relaxed again and looked at her. “So what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“Do? There’s nothing to do.”</p>
<p>“Well you have to give him an answer.”</p>
<p>“No I don’t. Where’s the rule on that?”</p>
<p>“Lysandra. Come one. The guy is—“</p>
<p>“Is what, Matt? Being vulnerable with me? Going out on limb? Exposing his soul? What are you going for here, buddy?”</p>
<p>“Okay, sarcasm is your defense mechanism. So for whatever reason, this is hitting a raw nerve. But yeah, all those things. This is some serious stuff.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Now you and me are not going to talk about it.”</p>
<p>“Hey, woman, you’re the one who brought it up with me.”</p>
<p>“True. But only because you’re supposed to agree with me. You’re my friend, on my side, partner.”</p>
<p>“Friends don’t let friends act stupid unless it will be hysterical.”</p>
<p>“I. Am not Derek.” Lysandra tapped the table with each word. “So you do not get to make jokes at my expense.”</p>
<p>“I’m just being honest. I don’t like the guy but I think he’s good for you.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you like him?”</p>
<p>“For all the same reasons you shouldn’t like him either.”</p>
<p>Esben was the Elbie, not the man. Esben had been the worst of them all and caused all of them the most suffering. Edward, as a host, had not come onto the scene until well after the damage had been done. Being allied with the worst Elbie of them all did not help his case in the eyes of Matt and his friends.</p>
<p>“You mean you don’t like his Elbie.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like either of them, but as a host Edward has really tamed that Elbie and I’m sure the world is a better place for it, even though he refuses to register or cooperate directly with us.”</p>
<p>Lysandra drew doodles in her cup sleeve with her thumb nail. Edward and Esben were very distinct entities that happened to work really well together.</p>
<p>“You’re smiling.”</p>
<p>Lysandra looked up. “What?”</p>
<p>“I said, you are smiling.”</p>
<p>“Shut up.” She sat up in her chair and took another sip of coffee. Matt broke off pieces of his cookie, looking at her. “Fine, Matthew. I’ll think about it.”</p>
<p>“There ya go.” He gulped down his milk in triumph.</p>

<p>“Remind me again why we can’t go in our own clothes.” Matt’s voice came from behind a pile of colorful fabrics. He had been the first to finish her food and therefore the first to be fitted.<br/><br/>Great swaths of color draped down from floor to ceiling in the crowded shop. So far India seemed to be a place of enhanced senses. Or maybe people’s senses were deadened and that was the problem. From the moment they landed in the country it felt like all of Lysandra’s senses were under attack and she was not the only one that felt that way. From the heat and stench or the place to the color of food and clothes there was no rest for the senses so far.<br/><br/>“Why’d we bring him again?” Lysandra jerked her thumb at Ian who was being measured for his Punjabi.<br/><br/>Eriksson paused before answering. “If we are dealing with Elbie he will be able to speak to them directly.”<br/><br/>Matt pulled on the collar of his tan Punjabi as he stepped forward and presented himself to the group. “You mean Ian is the only one willing to communicate directly with Elbie.”<br/><br/>“We could have brought—“<br/><br/>“Kwin,” Eriksson cut Lysandra off, “would have been too conspicuous.”<br/><br/>Lysandra snorted. “We would stand out less dressed as tourists. And Kwin could have come in the cargo hold and saved the tax payers some money.”<br/><br/>“It that your concern, fiscal responsibility?” Eriksson kept his tone even.<br/><br/>Ian returned to the group in his linen Punjabi. “I love undercover work.”<br/><br/>Lysandra snorted a second time.<br/><br/>The owner of the shop came to the group talking quickly in Hindi and making gestures at Lysandra<br/><br/>Sadhri spoke with him and turned to Lysandra. “It’s your turn. Have you picked a fabric yet?”<br/><br/>“I still think going native is a bad idea.” She protested as she was being led away.<br/>“I vote for green.” Matt shouted after her.<br/><br/>Sadhri followed Lysandra to the back so she could translate. “They are right?”<br/>“Who?” Lysandra held her arms out as she was being measured. <br/><br/>“Matthew. Green is an excellent choice.” She pointed at a ream of green and gold to the owner and said something to him. “I recommended to the commander that you use native clothing. Where we are going the people are not used to foreigners and being dressed in traditional garments will help them to trust us.”<br/><br/>“Well I’ll take your word for it but don’t tell Eriksson. I prefer to complain loudly and frequently about it.”<br/><br/>“To what end?”<br/><br/>“To piss him off of course.”<br/><br/>“Isn’t he your superior? Is this not looked down upon?”<br/><br/>Lysandra laughed. “Ah, technically he is, but I am an exception to this group. If I were an actual member of the group then, yeah, but I’m not really.”<br/><br/>Sadhri looked over shoulder where the others waited. “You seem a part of the group to me. I don’t think I understand your meaning.”<br/><br/>“I’m an orphan that they seem determined to smother.”<br/><br/>“I don’t think that Commander Eriksson would have brought you if that were true. He accepts you. He trusts you.”<br/><br/>“Ha!” Lysandra had to steady yourself. The woman at the sewing machine working on green cloth jumped. “Now that’s entrainment. Hold that thought a few more hours and you’ll how very much I am not a part of the group.”<br/><br/>The woman from the sewing machine came and handed Sadhri a pile of fabric. “Would you like help wrapping your sari?” She asked Lysandra.<br/><br/>“Definitely. I don’t want that thing unwrapping on me.”<br/><br/>After getting the matching top on over her bra Lysandra suffered in silence as Sadhri and the shop woman moved around her wrapping the sari around her. It was a dark green weaved with a copper pattern. Her midsection was exposed on the sides and there was no place her to conceal anything. She would have to rig something for thigh.<br/> <br/>“I’m not going out there like this.” Lysandra looked at herself in the mirror. <br/><br/>“You have nothing to be ashamed of.” Sadhri stood with her. “After a few minutes you will forget all about it.<br/> <br/>Sadhri’s had picked a sari that was blue at the center and phased into yellow with gold weaved patterns. It was a perfect match to her skin tone. Next to Sadhri Lysandra felt like she had never seen the sun in her life, her skin was so light in comparison. The shop woman was behind Lysandra braiding her hair<br/><br/>Sadhri took Lysandra’s hand. “They will forget too. It will only be a few minutes.”<br/><br/>“It’s humiliating.”<br/><br/>“That’s not how it’s intended.”<br/><br/>Lysandra sighed heavily. “Let’s get this over with.”<br/><br/>The two of them walked out together. Matt stood up at the sight of them and whistled. “Wow.

But how many parents did she see in a given week saying the same thing about their totally human offspring. Minilla, his actual name, but everyone referred to him as “the Son of Godzilla, this was just one of his many gripes about humanity and having a famous father.<br/><br/>Rivalry:<br/>Irina remembered the day Kellen enrolled in her school. It was like from Day 1 he had it in for her. It was stupid really because while he broke every one of her records, in the order that she had had achieved them, his could not be compared to hers because he was male and she was female. No one thought anything of it because boys and girls records were never compared to each other. But somehow, in her gut, Irina knew that he had broken her records on purpose and in some strange way was challenging her to break his.  She had no way to explain why she thought this. He never taunted her verbally, he never spoke to her at all. It was just pure instinct. And maybe the way he looked at when she passed by him in the hallway.</p>

<p>Elba<br/>The humans, they call me Elba. That is not my name and this is not my planet. I have left them both aside but this was not of my choosing. I am not like the humans; I am an oddity among them. My short coarse fur is to my advantage since our refuge in the old subway tunnels does not offer much warmth. At times I am an object of fear and anger because I look like the enemy. I look like the ones that have destroyed their homes, stripped their planet, and killed their loved ones. I look like that ones that did this but I am not like them either.<br/>	Like the humans I am a victim of tyranny by outsiders. There are others like me on my world but they are beyond my reach so I have taken my place with the only ones I can relate too. I will stand with them even if at times they can’t stand the sight of me.<br/>On my world I was what the humans refer to as a scholar. The young ones say ‘geek’ but this is a word I do not understand no matter how many times they try to explain it with their excited gestures and pitched voices. As a ‘scholar’ I am compelled by my curiosity and habits to capture the story of human kind. That is my goal. It is really a story of desperation, daring, and discovery. These kind of tales have both tragedy and triumph no matter where you come from.<br/>	What is this phenomenon called humankind? There is nothing like it in the whole universe. It is unique. Of all the wonders among the stars it is odd to my kind that something so desperately chaotic should exist. Geo physics and free will aside, life here is hard and beautiful all at once and our arrival has only emphasized these attributes.<br/>	We have never encountered another species. Like you we thought we were alone. Like you we felt that something so vast as what you call the Universe should contain a lot more but nothing can really prepare you for such an encounter.<br/>	The darkness that had swallowed my being passed and light was left in its place. For some time I was not sure that I was living. I thought I was existing between planes of reality. Eventually memories returned to me and I remembered that we had been sent here. I, and the others with me, were sent to explore this planet. We were to be left and at a designated time a ship would return to pick us up. How long ago that was I cannot say. Unless something has happened to the rest of my species they will come.<br/></p>

<p>“Mr. Moore?” She giggled nervously, smoothing the sleeves of her navy blue suit jacket. Everything was perfectly pressed; the knee length skirt, white pinstriped blouse, and goldenrod ascot— perfectly poofed. “Oh, he is a nice man. So well mannered. He was my first sale ever. And my biggest sale you know. Ever. Of course it is the biggest property in the area so that isn’t much of a surprise.” Her desk was adorned with pictures of cats doing cute things. It was personal, the personal touch without over doing it. It was a functional desk, with matching accessories, the jubilee of pens in the burgundy holder, her business cards leaning at just right angle from the burgundy dispenser.<br/>	“Yes, it’s true.” As if to dispel any disbelief. “That house had been in the Rochester family ever since people have settled in this area. That’s a couple hundred years, you know.” She straightened the nameplate on her desk, Beverly Banks, in black on faux copper. It was a large replica of the mini one pinned on her left shoulder above an embroidered logo, 21st Century Realty, also in goldenrod.<br/>	“Such a fascinating place. It started off small, you know, just a place to keep the snow off ya really. Terrible. Can you imagine, no central heating? In these mountains. Those pioneers, real troopers I tell ya. It’s a wonder any of them lived through that first winter. In the spring, that’s when the first loggers started coming in, ready to work. It wasn’t just about the trees you know, they were put to good use of course, but what it was really about was getting the tracks laid to finish the first railway across the country.<br/>	“Oh! I’m so sorry,” she lifts her hand in the air and wiggling her understated, but tastefully groomed fingernails in a dark pink color, not scandalous like red would be, but not the cotton candy pink of a tween. Lifting slightly from her seat she looks across the top of the cubicles, “Marie!” She waits until she has the girl’s attention and then beckons her over. “Can we get some more coffee over here for our guest? Thank you.” She sits down again folding her hands in front of her. “Now, Mr. Moore—“<br/>Marie quickly appears, she is young, just out of high school most likely. Her shoes made of shiny black patent leather, like a dolls, her office casual clothes fit her awkwardly, too restrictive maybe. She holds a plastic tray, fake wood grain on both sides, and sets it down on the edge of Beverly’s desk, a silver carafe, a coffee mug of milk, and three kinds of sweetener in white, blue, and yellow packets.<br/>	“Aren’t you thoughtful,” Beverly squeezes Marie's elbow. “She’s my best pupil,” she smiles at the girl. Marie smiles apologetically, blushing, embarrassed and leaves. “Someday, when I have to leave God’s green earth I know, that while I may not have children, my legacy will go on in people like her.” She watches as Marie goes back to whatever it was she was doing before. “She is such a wonderful girl.” Beverly’s gaze goes into the distance.<br/>	So many nice people and nice things fill her life. Her cats, the Monday night quilting circle, and of course her job and all of it in a place like this, one of America’s most pristine Alpine forests. The freshest air on earth, the cleanest water anywhere. Surrounded by pines every day smelled like Christmas to her. Christmas and sunshine. Sometimes, when it’s been snowing like crazy for a few hours and she has just spent two hours shoveling out a path for her car and she looks back to see she has to do it again, with trembling arms and her back on fire in excruciating pain, she thinks maybe she should finally get out of this place. Afterward, sitting in front of the fireplace, wool blankets piled on her legs and a cup of homemade hot chocolate in her favorite mug, a photo of Mit Mit and Choo Choo in Santa hats, she watches the snow fall and with a deep breath of satisfaction. All the frustration of the previous few hours melts away like snow on your tongue. What a blessed life this is.<br/>	She blinks suddenly. “I don’t know what is wrong with me today.” She reaches up, patting her dark auburn curls. The precisely sculpted chunks of hair are held in perfectly unnatural places and add a few inches to her height. She clears her throat, “Where were we? Yes, the Rochester Estate.” Folding her hands again, she takes a deep breath.<br/>	“Logging became a big business up here, well still is, and of course once the trains were running that brought in all kinds of people looking to start new lives and more people means more business. Mr. Rochester was an excellent business man and his house grew right along with the town and his… assets.<br/>	“He’s a very important man around here, Mr. Rochester, he was our first mayor. Have you driven around much? Rochester High School. The middle school was named after his wife, Margaret Winslow- Rochester. If it wasn’t for him, this town wouldn’t be nearly as nice as it is. Many of the streets are named after his heirs.” She nods her head assuredly, as if to say that’s a fact, everyone knows it.<br/>	“The house, the house, the house.” She poured herself a fresh cup of steaming coffee, without putting any sugar or cream in she stirred her spoon absently. Clink, clink, clink. “Each addition was always a new undertaking. It meant clearing more trees and moving more dirt, it’s on the side of a hill you know. Sometimes it involved blasting right through all that rock. From certain angles it looks like the house has grown right out of the side of the mountain. Some of that was intentional. Mr. Rochester loved nature and it was important to him that nature was not interrupted just because he was there.<br/>“Here’s a fun fact.” She leaned forward across her desk as if she was about to reveal a great secret.  “Did you know there is a room, right in the middle of the house, that is made of the original walls and a ceiling that Mr. Rochester had cut down himself all those years ago? Completely made of pine tree trunks. Makes it look like a giant Lincoln Logs cabin.” She leaned back in her seat. “So it’s said, anyways. It’s supposed to be the wood from the original structure; it’s possible, I guess. They could carbon date it or something, I’m sure, to check if it’s the original cabin, but what does it matter really, it’s the thought that counts, right?” She looks wide- eyed for a nod of mutual agreement.<br/>	“Through the years rooms were added onto other rooms, hallways extended. On occasion there had been a collapse due to heavy snow. Because of that the roof has several tiers where the owner at the time decided to add high ceilings, or a new level, that kind of thing. In a way I think each Rochester has left his or her mark on the house.<br/>“Because of all the changes and reconstructions, there is nothing symmetrical or reasonable about the place. But my, it is a beautiful house, don’t get me wrong. In the entry is this gorgeous wood staircase, and beautiful slate stone work everywhere. Majestic fireplaces in most of the rooms, including bathrooms. I have never seen anything so beautiful in all my life.<br/>“So tastefully decorated but it is a bear getting through it. I literally needed a map to find my way around the place. The county clerk had so many blueprints on file I finally had to call in an architect to make whole new ones just to update the county records. It had to be surveyed so we could list it properly and makes sure that all those changes hadn’t created some unforeseen damage.”<br/>	Her eyes dropped and her lips were pressed together in a tight frown. “Poor Mr. Rochester, Richard. He was the last of them, no children, even the grandchildren were up in years.” She shook her head sadly. “So many of their beautiful things sent to auction. There was some mix up at the lawyers about his will, I don’t remember, it was so long ago now, but they needed a realtor and by default really, the account was given to me.<br/>	“The grounds are extensive, massive, most of it rock, and dirt, just pure forest, not really any gardens to speak of. And the private road, it’s quite long when you consider the cost of up keep and plowing in the winter.<br/>“Mr. Moore, he pays to maintain the road at his own expense, no tax dollars are used for it.” She chuckles softly to herself. “You know, he even pays to make sure there is plenty of avalanche control. I suppose he would lose a lot if anything happened to the house. I’m sure he must have other homes. A man in his position usually does. But I don’t really know, I’ve only sold him the one.<br/>She leans in, this time much closer, her voice dropping below the chatter of the other agents on the phone or at the water cooler. “I can’t tell you anything personal of course, I respect my clients privacy, and the law. But. I did Google his name once, he’s quite a prolific man. It’s the perfect house for him really. As diverse and interesting as he is.” She winks.<br/>	A shadow fell across the desk. Without moving, her eyes shifted up, “Marie!” She forced an impatient smile, “what can I do for ya?”<br/>	Marie leans in and smiles plaintively, “Your three o’clock appointment is ready.”<br/>With surprise and ting of irritation at Marie, Beverly checks her watch. “Oh my. I love it when I’m busy, just makes the day fly by. It feels so productive too.” She waves Marie away and stands to her feet. Leaning over she straightens a photo of her with a man, they are young, the gold bands on their fingers gleam. Beverly is still wearing hers.<br/>“It has been so nice talking with you today.” She tugs on the hem of her jacket. “If you have any other questions please don’t hesitate to give me a call. You have my card…” She looks over, “Good.”<br/>“Mr. Moore, he is a very nice, so lovely to talk to, I sure hope you get the chance to meet him. It is a unique experience. Now remember, if you are thinking about relocation, it’s not a bad place to be, give me a call if you want to look at some properties.” She winks.<br/>Beverly squinches her eyes shut. “What a ninny.” She shakes her head and puts her hands on her hips. “Honestly, I do not know what has come over me. I have never done something like this before; you must think me so rude. I never asked your name.” She held out her hand, her smile bigger than ever.<br/></p>

If that's the  Welcomeology!®  'brand', it certainly makes ordinary people look oversized, dark, and gloomy. <br/> <br/>         The subject of today’s all-staff meeting was branding, and Sharon Harper was the brand facilitator brought in at some expense to “ensure that brand values came from within, not from the outside or from the top down.” At least, that was how the email from the new Deputy Director of Community Awareness had described it.

But months go by and Alexander Covington and his junior Logan Madden are still no closer to finding her. With that, and the fact that Derek, a recently out of work cameraman has somehow managed to get hold of some of this so called propaganda and has decided that Karsh would make a fitting mascot for a revolution, and the Party is beginning to crack down on anyone thought to support the ""Free Melody"" movement.

<p>            “What information can you give us about these terrorists?”</p>
<p>            “The main one we are looking for is a 19 year old by the name of Melody Karsh,” Covington said, ”I believe we have a picture?”</p>
<p>            “Yes, it should be right in top corner of the screen,” Denise beamed.</p>
<p>            “Right.” Covington shifted in his seat, “We found information regarding her treachery against the government. With her former Party status, we believe this group was plotting against the government.”</p>
<p>            “What information?”</p>
<p>            “That’s classified.” Covington glared.</p>
<p>           “What other information should the public be aware of?”</p>
<p>            “Well we were able to detain an accomplice of Karsh, and it was reveled that she was operating under an alias, Sam Trillow. The accomplice denied any affiliation with her other affiliates, Elizabeth, Gregory, and Leon Myers. We have to assume, however, that they could be using aliases as well.”</p>
<p>            Derek’s hand tightened on the camera stand. Her name was Sam? And Sean had…no. It was too big of a coincidence. Even so…he wanted to see that picture.</p>
<p>            “They should also be aware,” Covington continued, “That these people are skilled at distributing anti-government propaganda and are determined to escape justice. I will not get into the specifics of the propaganda for obvious reasons, but those who commit treason must be held accountable. The public must be cautious and alert, and report any sightings of Karsh to the hotline number listed below, or to their local authorities.”</p>
<p>            “How long ago did they disappear?” Denise asked.</p>
<p>            Everyone froze. Morgan started frantically looking around as if searching for a black hole to jump into.</p>
<p>            “The moment it was determined we had lost trace of her we began our investigation. We are positive she and the others will be found quickly, but it would be best for the public to remain vigilant and help our investigation during this time.” Covington’s face did not show a trace of rage, but the room could feel it emanating from him in waves.</p>
<p>            “But, Detective, if she’s only been gone a day, surely it would not be a national story? It would be confined to a regional area. So, just so the people will have an idea of how far she could have gotten to….” Denise smile seemed to crack as Covington’s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>            “She’s been gone a week.” Covington said icily. “Which is why we are urging the public to remain attentive and tell authorities if there are any sightings of her or her allies.”</p>
<p>            “Commercial!” Morgan frantically mouthed, “Go to commercial!”   </p>
<p>            “Well we thank you very much Detective Covington for your time and shall follow your advice. Again, the hotline number is listed below. And now, a word from our sponsors.”</p>
<p>            “Clear!” Morgan called, and Covington stood up. He said no word to anyone, but strode out of the studio without a backward glance.</p>
<p>            Morgan started screaming the second he was out of earshot.</p>
<p>            “DO YOU WANT US SHUTDOWN? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU’VE DONE?”</p>
<p>            “Morgan, what is he going to do?” Denise asked, leaning back. “Look, he didn’t want me to ask a question, and I did anyways. People deserve to know how far she’s gotten. If she’d only been gone a day, there’s no way she’d have been able to get farther than, say, Pennsylvania or, maybe Ohio or North Carolina. So it would’ve been silly for people on the West Coast to worry. But she’s been gone a week, and they still haven’t caught her. No wonder they’ve actually gone to the press. They never actually announce stories like this. I wanted to know why.”</p>
<p>            Megan gaped at her, before returning to the mixing booth. Derek followed her, and peeked over her shoulder to watch the playback.</p>
<p>            There, on the screen, were the pictures of the so called terrorists. And there was her picture. She’d been with Sean that night, he’d seen her picture, the background of Sean’s phone, heard Sean moping about her.</p>
<p>            “We have a problem.” He muttered to Megan.</p>
<p>            “What?” Megan jumped, not having seen him following her. “Why?”</p>
<p>            “Because that girl’s been gone a hell of a lot longer than a week.”</p>

This surely can’t take that much longer, can it?<br/><br/>Caught between a stubborn old woman, a best friend who doesn’t see her for who she is now, and a city she left on her eighteenth birthday, Hope snaps. The town may have underestimated Grandma, but Grandma has underestimated Hope.<br/><br/>She seizes legal control of Grandma’s assets in order to set everything straight. When Hope hires Ed, a contractor and an old classmate from high school, she only wants him to rebuild the house. When he also builds a relationship with her, she falls for him. Hard.<br/><br/>Hope doesn’t know what she wants anymore. She has to decide whether this love, despite the issues with her hometown and her old best friend, not to mention her grandmother, are worth giving up the life she left town for in the first place.</p>

<p>Abby Brewer just cut a deal with a talking frog.</p>
<p>He's retrieving her lucky soccer ball, which is floating away down the river, in exchange for a promise: she must help him become human again and get back to his fairy-tale kingdom.</p>
<p>Varsity tryouts begin today, and she's doomed without her ball. If she can't make the team, she can't get her dad off her case and can't get Jackson Foster to finally notice her.</p>
<p>All the frog needs is a kiss, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Attempting to turn Prince Brendan back into a human takes longer than either of them plans. It also attracts the attention of the sorceress who cast the spell over him. Abby's got to help Brendan before the witch finds them and transforms Abby into a frog, too.</p>
<p>Abby wants to get the whole thing over with and focus on her own life – namely Jackson. When she falls for Brendan, keeping her promise may be the hardest thing she's ever had to do. Besides outwitting a witch, of course.</p>
<p>Right.</p>

<p>She sat at the corner of the room, looking across the tavern with hooded eyes. She tapped her foot with annoyance briefly and sighed. Her eyes wandered to the clientele in the opposite corner of the room, who were engaged in deep conversation. Her mouth quirked in consternation as her mind wandered, her eyes losing focus as she watched.</p>
<p>The lights overhead didn’t reach far enough, leaving parts of the establishment eerily dark. Maybe with comrades it would seem comfortable, almost cozy, but sitting alone she felt unsettled. She scratched the wooden table absentmindedly with her fingernail, trying to focus and enjoy her drink, but she felt something tugging downward at her. She felt like she was in a haze.</p>
<p>“Can I get you another?” A voice called out across the room. She jumped slightly and looked with wide eyes at who had spoken.</p>
<p>“You look like you could use another…”</p>
<p>She watched as a bartender slowly came around the counter towards her, a slight grin on his face. She unconsciously tensed, her shoulders collapsing inward slightly. One side of his mouth curled up slightly, noticing her reaction.</p>
<p>“Easy there. I’m just here for a little conversation. You look like you could use to take your mind off something.” He tentatively put his hand on the chair across from her.</p>
<p>She studied his face, searching for signs of ill will. Her eyes narrowed and she frowned slightly. Taking a deep breath and sighing as she concluded that he seemed honest enough, she looked down at the table briefly and gave a hint of a bitter smirk.</p>

139,MamaHen40,Novel: The WayFinder,Genre: Science Fiction,66128,"2,204",1,"
<p>A young computer programmer works for a startup that has an app that gives intelligent, up to the minute driving directions. She is put in charge of fixing a bug that has been sending drivers on weird, out of the way routes to their destinations. After listening to some of the stories people report about their experiences that result from the odd routings, she decides to let the app lead her through a route that helps her reconnect with something important from her past that she hadn’t realized she had been missing (prerequisite). Eventually, she comes to believe that something more spiritual has become enmeshed in the artificial intelligence engine that drives the wayfinding app, maybe a saint or the Virgin Mary, or God Himself (requirement). But when she shares her findings with others, she is laughed at, and worse, almost loses her job (costs) because of course, any discussion of the spiritual in context within the realm of science and technology is completely blown off by the establishment (preconditions). At first she decides to just keep things to herself, but the startup she works for is running out of money (forewarning), and she learns that if they don’t get more funding all operations are likely to be shuttered, including pulling the plug on the servers running the saintly AI (consequence). She decides that she will have to get others to believe in the AI saint as well, to get help saving the program from being unplugged (story goal). She meets a professor of computer science from India, who is the first person to believe her about the spiritual nature of the AI (prerequisite). Luckily, the AI saint itself is able to help her find a way to bring its messages to more people and build a following as well (dividend). As word starts to spread though, she finds herself in conflict with leaders of major world religious organizations, who want to either control her and the AI or undermine her credibility by telling people it is a fraud or the work of the devil (forewarnings / consequence).</p>
<p>From the beginning of the story, the young computer programmer never intended to be an entrepreneur herself, she just saw herself as a programmer, interested in the calming mental challenge of solving problems via code. She has to change this attitude and be willing to become a leader of the startup herself, setting an actual vision for how the app and its saintly AI will be made available to the public. After making this personal adjustment, she succeeds in getting enough backing to buy out the startup herself, via a crowdfunding campaign. She has a show-down with the original founders, the VC’s who provided the previous funding, and several religious leaders to wrest control of the technology owned by the startup.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">I quickly pull the sleeping bag up over my head. Hooves thunder across the field in the quiet of predawn. Grandma Celia said something about what if you get trampled by deer. I silently laughed. Now I was facing that very thing. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">I chose to set up camp in the middle of the two old fields. Better site lines all around me. Better light as the day fades. The ground felt like an earthquake but it was only 8 white tails, a big buck at the lead. No denying they were headed straight for me. I clamped my hand over Max’s mouth. She was growling anyway. I stuffed the little terrier down farther in the sleeping bag. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">The deer stopped about 20 feet from me. Huge snorts of steam exploding from their muzzles in the cold crisp air. The buck shook his head up and down vigorously a few times. He moved forward slowly. Curiously. I was still jammed down in the sleeping bag, feeling ridiculously vulnerable. Holding Maxine’s muzzle shut with one hand, holding the sleeping bag around my face with the other. As if by holding it closed he couldn’t smell me. Futility. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">The buck inched closer getting braver with every step. His front hooves were a foot or two from my head. If he spooked right now? I didn’t even breathe. He sniffed at the sleeping bag were my head was. I could feel the heat of his breath, steamy and rapid from running. He snorted probably from my smell. They hate the smell of human hair. Two or three more snorts. My heart was hammering so hard I was sure it would explode. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">Maxine was still, sensing our predicament. If she barked now, would he dance on my face? The buck jumped up on his front legs, spinning on his back legs and bounded off to the does standing near. As one, they continued running across the field and into the woods on the other side. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">I let go of Max and pulled her to me. Holding onto her tight. It was hard to make sense of what just happened. That didn’t just happen. Did it? Blood was pounding in my skull with painful intensity. I’m sure I was all jazzed up on adrenaline. Fight or flight. Not too many possibilities for flight in a sleeping bag.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">Every year in October I camped up here. My family owned 40 acres of land on the top of the bluff. No road access, very remote. That’s why I loved it. My dad chopped wood up here before winter every year when he was a kid. Only thing it was used for now was deer hunting. I loved watching them as their behavior intensified with the fall rut. They were so plentiful up here. Regular routes crisscrossing the bluff in all four directions. Down the east side of the bluff it was steep and rocky and insane to think of how easily they navigated the face.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">It took a little time for me to calm down and feel safe enough to let Max out of the sleeping bag. It was time to go. I had to get home and get ready for school. It was Friday. Football rally, Donut Deli, game tonight. I had to go. Maxine was more than willing to jump out of the bottom of the sleeping bag and run around barking and being all tough, now. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">I laid in the warmth of the bag a few more minutes and scooched over to my water bottle. It was so cold and calming to do something normal. Would I tell anyone at school today?</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">No. Who would believe me. They thought I was nuts just because I camped the whole month of October in some god forsaken corner of nowhere, got up at the crack of dawn to go home and change and eat and go to school – when I could be sleeping in a warm house in a warm bed with indoor plumbing. Wake up with frost on your sleeping bag? Insane. I hated tents because you can’t see the stars. Why go camping if you’re not going to be outside? Hang the sleeping bag in the tree so a snake won’t crawl in? Rattlers were common up here. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">My best friend was a cheerleader. She could not understand my October habits. So we didn’t talk about it. Once in a while, she would ask me how I slept. I never said much more than, “Great.” </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">First hour today was drafting. Love that class. The athletic director teaches it. He’s the best. I am the only female in the class so my drafting table is the one directly facing his. Face to face. I am so totally his pet and he is mine. The quarterback for the football team sits on my right. Star tight end on my left. I love this class. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">I love it especially on Fridays because of the donut deli. I walk right by on the way to the drafting room and get a Honeymooner. O M G. Chocolate, chocolate covered, cream filled messy amazingness. My senses must still be a little jazzed up. The smell and the taste are hyper intense. Can’t take it into class. Mr. Athletic Director is standing at the door looking at his watch, watching me cram the last of my honeymooner into my face as the bell rings. I am into my seat by the time the bell rings.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">“That was close!” he says. “Your eyes are even more twinkly than usual. What have you been up to?” </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">You would never believe me in a hundred years mr athletic director. And yes, it was close.</span></p>

<p>    Xander’s eyes snapped back into focus. He was still in his living room; checking his watch, he could see he had only been daydreaming for a few minutes. It was late Saturday morning. Shaking out his arms, he looked around the room to see that everything was as he’d remembered; at least this flashback hadn’t come with any walking episodes.<br/>    It had been ten years since The Introduction, but he remembered it vividly. He thought of it often, noting how no one ever really understood what he was saying when he tried to explain what had happened and how he’d felt. It was the only time in his life when Xander had felt truly afraid, and he was the only person with whom he could talk about everything because he was the only person alive who had seen it all. The other person - the grinning woman - well, he assumed she was long gone, locked up forever, or better yet, dead.</p>

<p>Bobbie-Shawn, 17, is the oldest of four girls. Their mother, Darlene, drives them one night from their hometown in southeast Georgia to the grandparents' home in the Appalachian foothills to escape their father. While they're there, Shea burns down the house they'd left, along with family heirlooms and memorabilia. Bobbie-Shawn determines to figure out what would make her father the way he is; why won't he ever talk about his childhood?</p>
<p>Darlene is torn about her decision to leave her husband and grows into a withdrawn waif of a mother, who alternates between obsessive worry over her husband and fierce maternal emotions at seemingly random times. Bobbie-Shawn takes over the care of her three younger sisters. The youngest, Cassandra, constantly gets sick in the middle of the night. Audra Mae retreats into a world where her ""pets,"" the wildlife she rescues and rehabilitates, are her only concern. And the second oldest, Lanie-Mills, has a tendency to disappear and doesn't talk about where she's gone. Darlene sends Bobbie-Shawn to camp one summer to give her a break, and while there, she meets Sam Kelly, a gregarious young man from Chicago who takes an interest in her and offers the hope of escaping the situation she's in at home. He seems sure and determined with his plan for the two of them, but does she want to trust him to call all the shots, as he insists on doing?</p>

<p>Bobbie-Shawn leads her sister over the bowed rushes at low tide, stepping over the fiddler crabs on their way to the river. The sun lights everything around them into a washed-out haze, even this early in the day. It would be a hot one. They find their canister tied to a scrubby tree on a hammock that would be an island in a few hours. Inside, the few pictures of their family that still exist in the world. One a studio picture of the six of them, when Cassandra was only five months old, everyone wearing denim and staring awkwardly just to the right of the camera. Shea’s glasses were huge, covering half his face, and that’s when he still had a beard, covering the other half of his face. Cassandra sat on his lap, her chubby arms lifted like wings and his hands completely surrounding her torso. Cassandra stared and stared at this photo, while Bobbie-Shawn looked at the other two.</p>
<p>Annabelle-Grace and Lanie-Mills took up the foreground of the second picture, sitting in a kiddie pool together. Annabelle-Grace had slapped her hands into the water, and beads hung like an inverted chandelier around her. Lanie-Mills faced her sister but had reached out one arm to the side of the pool, her whole body leaning away from the sprays of water. In the fuzzy background, Bobbie-Shawn lay on a beach towel with her mother, reading a book together. Bobbie-Shawn lay on her stomach but her mom lay on her side, with her round belly facing the camera. Bobbie-Shawn remembers that story, one about a princess who would save the kingdom but thought she was a lowly slave.</p>
<p>The third picture is a candid of their mother and father. A friend had taken it at one of the many parties they used to host and they’re sitting on a couch, one she recognizes from before Lanie-Mills was born. There’s a baby swing in the background, so Bobbie-Shawn knows she’s around at this point. But her parents are leaning in to each other, Shea has his right arm around Darlene’s shoulders. And Darlene has her legs crossed toward Shea, and her hands gently clasped and tucked between her legs and his. Their shoulders are relaxed, their faces are at ease, they’re listening to someone, or more likely, watching a friend draw a Pictionary sketch. Someone on the other team. Bobbie-Shawn can remember that they had that kind of relationship once, but her two youngest sisters, Annabelle-Grace and Cassandra, know only their mother’s tense shoulders when their dad came in the room, her tight face when he spoke to her, his refusal to make eye contact with her and not say more words than he had to. They know only angry voices, late at night, the sounds of furniture in the kitchen getting banged around, a door slamming, the quiet of their mom’s crying. They know a fun dad, a loving dad, a dad whose breath sometimes smelled astringently sweet with rum or whiskey, a dad who took them on car rides to the beach and exploratory hikes through dry swamps. A dad who made their mom cry, and sometimes made them cry too.</p>
<p>Cassandra swaps photos with Bobbie-Shawn and lingers over the other two for a moment. “So it is possible for our family to be happy together,” she says.</p>
<p>“It was,” says Bobbie-Shawn, studying her youngest sister. She wants to say, <em>But you can’t make people see that, it’s not your job to fix us</em>, but she doesn’t.</p>

<p>Poor Umberto D. He has a hard lot in life. To go about in this social world with a face like that. I believe even his mother would have to admit that he is ugly. His face is like a deflated basketball used as a punching bag and then left in the sun to dry and crack. He was short and very stout. His hands were like sledge hammers. He crouched and waddled along on massive square boots, swinging his sledgehammer hands, and pivoting his basketball head this way and that to make sure of where he was going from his crouched position. And yet he was a gem. He was one of the most precious things on this earth because, despite his hideous appearance, and despite the way others treated him, he was good, and generous, and compassionate to all things living, even to other people. He spent his days in his garden, or rather it was the monastery’s garden, but he took responsibility for it as if he was the only one there, and to him it was his garden. It was the gift God had given him to take his mind away from the complications of society. The garden was simple and pure and sought nothing from the world except to exist. And the garden responded to him. He gave it love and it grew lavish. It produced food and flowers of every kind and attracted birds and bees and butterflies of seemingly infinite variety.</p>

185,Uriel238,Novel: Fleet & Federation,Genre: Science Fiction,25501,850,0,"
<p>I am editing the game I worked on last year <strong>which desperately needs a good title</strong>*, though at this point I'm liking the bennies of <em>Fleet &amp; Federation</em>, though can't completely commit to being sold on it. <em>F&amp;F;</em> It feels like the <em>Mortimer</em> before the <em>Mickey</em>; the <em>Bingo</em> before the <em>Frodo</em>.†<br/><br/>That said, I'm too deviant this year even to be regarded as a <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/forums/nano-rebels/threads/724"">NaNorebel</a>, more of a NaNo-satellite, though my fellow outside-the-boxers may debate the number of additional dimensions required to express the magnitude of my deviation. (Is it possible to think outside a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle"">Klein Bottle</a>?)<br/><br/>* Interestingly, the sequel (in the same diegesis) was much easier to name. The game <em>Space Pirates</em> was modeled on <em>Firefly</em> and <em>Serenity</em> as <em>F&amp;F;</em> is on <em>Star Trek</em> (both have an ensemble-based narrative). The diegetic term <em>pirate</em> became a catch-all for commercial crime in space (raiding, smuggling, illegal broadcasting and so-on), but between low profits driving small-ship commerce to less-legal revenue generation, and law-enforcement cracking down needlessly on procedural missteps (usually so they could be bribed), it eventually became impossible to operate a small commercial ship without doing something criminal, and the term pirate became synonymous with a small commercial ship and its crew (albeit a disparaging term). <em>Space Pirates</em> features the gritty underbelly of the Federation (and the fleet) involving shady deals, rampant double-crosses, fighting The Man and fabulous (highly illegal and questionably ethical) contraband. My far-reaching dream was to sell the design to Joss Whedon (or Fox) so that <em>Serenity</em> could fly again and <strong>you</strong> could be <strong>Malcom Reynolds!</strong><br/><br/>† Really. I kid you not. Bingo Baggins, but for an editor's recommendation. <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer"">I am not making this up.</a><br/><br/><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_concept"">High Concept</a> Premise:</strong> What if <em>Star Trek</em> was a reality show?<br/><br/><strong>Single Sentence Summary:</strong> Six young, idealistic fleet officers sign on to the Enterprise and what is the highest rated show in Federation media, only to discover it isn't as glamorous or as lofty as they imagined, or as is portrayed to the viewing public.<br/><br/><strong>Relevant details about the project:</strong><br/>~ It is an affectionate parody, though sometimes a deconstruction of <em>Star Trek: The Original Series</em><br/>~ It features more than a few nods to <em>The Next Generation</em>, significantly less the later spin-offs.<br/>~ My genericized exported elements such as <em>Pirates</em> and <em>Romans</em> have evolved significantly from their counterparts in the originals (<em>Klingons</em> and <em>Romulans</em> respectively, for example, Romans are much truer to <em>SPQR</em> preferring demonstrations of unstoppable force and superior culture over stealth and cunning.<br/>~ As I'm trying to avoid paying for IP licensing from Paramount (and shouldn't have to, since this is a parody) I've been really careful to allow Star Trek-specific diegetic elements be inferred but never expressed. I don't use any specific terms such as <em>phasers</em>, <em>tricorders</em>, <em>warp core</em> (there is a <em>power</em> core, though) and so on.* At this point, much of my diegetic elements are quite removed from their Trek-expy origins.<br/><br/>* Interestingly, warp drive or bending space is the going hypothesis as to how long distance travel would work as per the <em>Alcubierre metric</em> (by scrunching space before travelling through it, and then letting it unfurl afterwards, so that local speed never exceeds speed-of-light, or even comfortable levels of time dilation, for that matter).<br/><br/><strong>Game Title ideas:</strong><br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Fleet and Federation</em> (play on the phrase <em>King and Country</em>, also nodding to the <em>D&amp;D;</em> style RPG naming convention of the '70s)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Pioneers of the Future</em> (based on NASA's mission statement, 2006 <em>[to] pioneer the future in space exploration...</em>)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Pioneers of Tomorrow</em> (as immediately above, <em>Tomorrow</em> is a more raygun gothic term than <em>The Future</em>, as per Disney's <em>Tomorrowland</em>*)<br/><strong>Rejected names</strong><br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Trek!</em> (Working title. Would rile Paramount's lawyers)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Free Enterprise</em> (taken by a movie about trekkies pestering William Shatner. Seriously! And a sequel's in the works!)<br/><strong>~</strong> <em>Stars in SPACE!</em> (Too plain, and payoff of the double meaning was wasted).<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm open to, and in need of name ideas, specifically ones that might indicate a fleet-based <i>Wagon Train</i> to the stars, planet-of-hats milieu, yet won't work Paramount's lawyers into a froth.<br/><br/>* Disney is even considering <em>The Future</em> is a bit zeerusty a concept, so that Disneyland Paris features <em>Discoveryland</em> which features more steampunk and clockworkpunk themes hoping they will age better than futurological projections that need to be regularly replaced.<br/><br/>More later...<br/><em>last update: Tuesday, November 08, 2011 5:11:08 PM</em></p>

<p>Although the mechanism by which thoughts are separated from reality are unclear, the dreamers have made it clear that they do not have to remain separate. Not everyone can do it. For example, it wouldn't matter how long I sat around and daydreamed about pink kittens, said pink kittens would never appear in my room. But if a dreamer were to put some real thought into the idea of pink kittens, and then sit down and write a story, paint a picture, sing a song about pink kittens, then you may very well return home to find a whole litter of pink kittens sleeping on your pillow. <br/><br/>You can easily imagine how this could become a problem. Maybe your dog doesn't get along with kittens, or your spouse is allergic. Or maybe it isn't pink kittens that the dreamer was singing, dancing, writing about, but an angry tiger.<br/><br/>Naturally, something had to be done to control these odd points of breakdown between imagination and reality. That was the original purpose of the conduit, and the Institute. Perhaps it has gotten a bit out of hand over the years; there is an entire movement of people who think so, but honestly I don't pay much attention to the news about them. The dreamers aren't going anywhere, and my job is to look after the poor addled dreamers. After all as I have pointed out, their gift is not unmixed. </p>

But maybe a case of mistaken identity will be enough to help him find his lost idol.

<p>Thirty-Nine Palms		<br/>© 2012 Amelia Sue Marshall<br/><br/>begun 1 November 2012	updated: 2 Nov 2012<br/><br/>May Banister of Mojave<br/><br/>On the day she first saw Edward Loomis, the sky was painted a gritty pink hue above the horizon.  Blooming yuccas stood in a dark row, silhouetted on the hilltop where the sun had yet to rise.  From the distance came the trill of a cactus wren.<br/><br/>Over by the railroad loading dock, a group of the borax men were waiting for the westbound train.  She recognized Mister Stiles, sitting in the red buckboard wagon that belonged to Mister Borax Smith himself. But it was a tall, unfamiliar figure that caught her eye.  She drew a soft breath.  It had been a long time.<br/><br/>How much can be learned from a first impression, a fleeting moment, perhaps a momentous moment?  He stood, with broad-brimmed hat in his two hands, gazing at the desert sunrise.  There seemed to be a probity, a sobriety about him. His hair was dark brown, his features perhaps passed down from Viking warriors.<br/><br/>Enough idle fancies, May, she told herself.  Thou hast a business to run.<br/><br/>Gathering her skirts to descend the five steps, May walked around the corner to the livery stable where Dionisio waited with a handcart.  Exchanging timid smiles and greetings, they headed for the loading dock.  There would be no waiting today; the train was on time.  It came roaring into the town of Mojave.<br/><br/>With a mighty roar, a hiss of brakes, and a cloud of smoke, the iron behemoth settled back onto the rails.  Promptly the conductor popped open the rail car door.<br/><br/>A small crowd had gathered. Propelled forward by the sheer force of personality was Mister Zebulon Cornish, who kept the general store.<br/><br/>“Mornin’, mornin’!” he saluted them with his usual great cheer.  The conductor nodded politely, handing down the bulging canvas mailbag to Zebulon Cornish. His helper, the nephew of Mister Sun the laundryman, in turn accepted armloads of merchandise from the railroad men.<br/><br/>“Here Mizz Bannister, here’s your flour and sugar and beans.  And, oh yes, there’s a side of bacon and a bolt of brown cotton cloth,”<br/><br/>“Excuse me, where are my supplies?” a shrill voice piped up.  “I am expecting two bushel baskets of apples.”<br/><br/>May stood aside to admit Missus Cornelia Higgs to the fray.  That worthy was quick to demand what was her own, May reflected, but what’s a widow to do?<br/><br/>“Come along, Edward,”  Missus Higgs, with groceries now safely stowed in her cart, called toward the borax men, with a note of rare gaiety.  The tall stranger detached himself, telling Mister Styles that he would accompany them to the diggings on Monday morning. <br/><br/>There on the edge of the crowd, their brown eyes first met.<br/><br/>“Oh Edward,” cooed Missus Higgs. “May I present Missus Bannister, who keeps the east boardinghouse?  There are so many borax men now, and railroad men and travelers, that they need all the rooms we can offer.   May, this is my cousin Edward Loomis.  He just arrived last night from Chicago.”<br/><br/>Mister Loomis tipped his hat and bowed, gracefully.<br/><br/>“How do?” May murmured.  There was no more to be said that morning.<br/><br/>Back at the house, May helped Carmelita stack the groceries in the pantry, then carried the bolt of cloth to the sewing room. Her SINGER SEWING MACHINE, OPERATED BY FOOT TREADLE, was her prized possession.  It was the tool with which she made clothing, tablecloths napkins, and curtains for every window. Bed linen had been ordered from Chicago.  Monday would be washday, and Dionisio would help her cart the laundry to Mister Sun Cho Lee.  May prided herself on changing the linen on every bed at least once a month for the longer term guests, and she tried to change the sheets more often after guests who stayed only a few nights.  It seemed to make the men more courteous when they had clean surroundings to return to after work.<br/><br/>Carmelita had set a pot of beans to cook.  She was chopping the chile peppers and tomatoes that grew in their garden, irrigated with Mojave River water in the canals that had been dug by her hard-working Mexican helpers.  How different it was here in the West, May thought.  The Mexicans were quiet and modest, diffident even, around their employers. After hours she could hear their jolly music, faintly rising from their little village on the outskirts of town. Perhaps someday she would find herself in the same room with a Mexican mariachi band, with its odd-shaped guitars and military trumpets, the musicians singing in broad harmonies, clad in suits with glittered piping.<br/><br/>Back in Indiana she had been only sixteen when she was wed to Stephen Bannister. Her father gave permission reluctantly, knowing full well that every idle hour of their childhood had been spent together, riding off on the farm horses along country lanes far from the watchful eyes of their families. <br/><br/>Stephen had been well-known to be a very fine rider, and naturally Colonel  Jackson had come calling at their farm to ask him to enlist in the fighting Indiana Third Cavalry Regiment.  As Quakers, May’s own family members suffered much spiritual turmoil over the dilemma of whether to exercise their conscientious objection to war in a case where the intent of the hostilities was the abolition of the repugnant practice of enslaving Africans for hard labor in the South.<br/><br/> Stephen had served with distinction, the Colonel wrote to May, after her beloved husband and companion had fallen at Antietm. <br/><br/>That was how, at age 17, May became a widow woman, an object of pity in their small town.  The good Lord must have looked down upon her in her misery, for soon came a letter from her mother’s sister Sarah, providing a scholarship for May to attend the young women’s seminary in TERRA HAUTE. <br/><br/>Youth is marked with passion, yet it is also blessed with the ability to heal from the most grievous wounds. At the academy, May took to literature, to accounting, to the life of the mind and to business alike.  She discovered in herself a love of music, something that was not part of the Quaker worship experience.  She knew that now as a woman grown she could not go home again.<br/><br/>Her school chum Anna had married Amos Green, a telegrapher, and May had accepted their invitation to join them on a train trip to the California desert, where Amos would be stationed in the town of San Bernardino.  <br/><br/>They had boarded in Chicago. Over the next few days, as the scenery of the American West flew by, May’s thoughts also flew.  Where would she go?  What would the rest of her many tomorrows bring?  What was God’s divine plan for her life?<br/><br/>From the flat plains of Kansas to the rugged mesas east of Santa Fe, May felt like a stranger in this country. Crossing the parched expanses of Arizona, she wondered aloud at the varieties of land on God’s earth, so different from the rolling green hills from whence she had come.  But on awakening in the Mojave River Valley, the small, still voice within told her plainly that she had come to where she belonged.<br/><br/>Twenty years had now passed. Each year at Christmas or at Easter she took pains to travel to visit Anna and Amos Green, now parents of six children, all like nieces and nephews to her. <br/><br/>But most of her life, first as a farm girl, and now in keeping her boarding house, had been hard work. She was now nearly forty, a successful business woman who had never married.  Perhaps there was no man who could replace the love she had shared with Stephen.<br/><br/>In the mornings when no deliveries were expected, May liked to ride her mare Dolly on the nearby trails. Sometimes as she rode she felt the spirit of Stephen present  there in her heart. In the embankments at the base of the foothills she could find the imprints of ancient sea creatures, left from when this desert basin was under the ocean a million years ago. <br/><br/>Headed back to town, May could ask Dolly to take up a canter in the sandy washes. Thus it was on that cool Wednesday morning that they emerged behind the west side boardinghouse of Missus Higgs.<br/><br/>That cousin of hers, that Mister Loomis, was standing on the back porch, shirtless, attending to his washing-up.  May observed that he was shaving, studying himself gravely in a small mirror.  Glancing up, he noticed her arrival.  Embarrassed somewhat at what felt like her unwitting intrusion, May gave an offhanded wave, then turned and trotted Dolly eastward along the street.<br/><br/> Well, even with plenty of sewing to be done at the house, accounts to be reviewed, and pies to be made for Sunday dinner, May did have legitimate reason for being abroad in town this morning.  She sat deep in the saddle to whoa Dolly, dismounted, removed the bit from the mouth of the mare, and tied her to the rail in front of the Yellow Aster Mercantile Company.<br/><br/>Zebulon Cornish, as was his custom, was bustling about in the back storeroom, all the while chattering amiably to young Sam Sun.  Having been an apprentice to the talkative Mr. Cornish since boyhood, the younger Mr. Sun spoke the English language with no Chinese accent.  Whereas most of the China men labored in the heat at the borax diggings or laying track for the railroad, the Sun family pursued business in town, working harder than many of the white people.<br/><br/>At some point May intended to ask Sam Sun about his family back in China, and whether any of their women folk would someday be allowed to join them here in California.  But it was a rare occasion when Sam could get a word in edgewise when Zebulon Cornish was holding forth.<br/><br/>Mister Cornish was a thin man, wiry as a whipsnake, with twinkling blue eyes. There were few hairs on his narrow, rounded head, but he sported yellow-white chin whiskers that gave him the appearance of a goat.  He seemed to be animated with an inner pep that caused him to cheerfully ask the most personal questions of everyone he met.  People new to town were sometimes offended at this, and gave curt replies.  But Zebulon Cornish appeared not to notice, and continued his interrogation until the customer fled.  This was of no concern to the shopkeeper, as the next general store was at least one hundred miles in any direction, and anyone worth knowing would soon return to his emporium.<br/><br/>As a consequence of his keen interest in everyone’s lives, Zebulon Cornish had a great deal of information to share, and his only known vice was his gossiping.<br/><br/>“Howdy Mizz Bannister.  I got some new sewing notions you might want to look over, and some darning needles and yarn.  Got some barrels of red spples, too.”<br/><br/>“Yes, thank you, Mister Cornish, we can certainly use two bushels.”<br/><br/>Mister Sun went to work, gathering apples into baskets, discarding ones with bruises or other damage.  May nodded, with an approving smile.<br/><br/>“Have you met Mizz Higgs’ cousin yet, Ed, just come to town?  Come from Chicago.  Some kind of engineer, land surveyor, I think he said. Going out to Greenland Ranch in Death Valley to help John Perry tinker with the borax wagons.  I think that Mizz Higgs is sweet on ol’ Ed.  He’s only her third cousin, after all.  Wife died of pneumonia last winter.”<br/><br/>Speak of the devil.  The clatter of hobnail boots on the board walkway announced the arrival of Cornelia Higgs.  Whether she had overheard these remarks by Zebulon Cornish was not to be made clear. It was to May that Missus Higgs promptly turned.<br/><br/>“WELL, Missus Bannister, aren’t you the least bit fearful to be riding out in the desert by yourself?  I would be worried about the snakes. And there’s some people who might find it a nosy thing for you to be doing, peering into people’s windows from the back yards.”<br/><br/>Zebulon Cornish could barely contain his mirth.  Eyes aglitter, he waited with patient anticipation for what promised to be an entertaining exchange.<br/><br/>“Dolly is very aware of snakes, Missus Higgs,” was the measured reply.  “She does not like snakes, and many times I have seen her quickly stomp on them with her powerful hooves.  And she has such a swift canter than when we ride past the town I am taking no notice of what goes on at people’s homes.  You should try horseback riding yourself sometime.  I find it a very good way to find respite from the cares of the workaday world.”<br/><br/>Missus Higgs had nothing to say in reply.  Anticipating her next request, Zebulon Cornish handed her a SEARS AND ROEBUCK CATALOG and a letter.  <br/><br/>“Looks like your people back in Illinois,” he observed.<br/><br/>The features of Cornelia Higgs softened momentarily as she gazed at the letter in her hands. <br/><br/>“My cousin Harriet will be wondering how her son is doing.”<br/><br/>“You mean Ed?” Zebulon inquired.<br/><br/>“Yes.  Harriet will understandably want to know that Edward has arrived safely.  Tomorrow morning early he will ride with Mister Stiles and the twenty-mule team up to the Greenland Ranch.  He will be working with Mister Perry.”<br/><br/>“Ed told me that he is a land surveyor,” commented Zebulon. <br/><br/>Cornelia Higgs smiled proudly.<br/><br/>“Edward is a man of many talents. He is a surveyor and quite handy with machinery.  He has been to college.  Mister Perry asked him to help with the design of the borax wagons.  They must be very strong and sturdy to carry the borax and also the water tank must ride securely over those rutted roads.  They will need to bring the Chinamen to fix some of the roads that were flooded in the spring.”<br/><br/>May nodded and told them good-bye.  This would be a good time to slip away from the tiresome Cornelia.  There was supper to be prepared for her guests.<br/><br/>Back at the house, Carmelita was sitting on the open porch, gazing up toward Wingate Wash as she snapped green beans into a great basket propped unsteadily on her capacious lap.   May went back into the garden, pleased to see that the corn stalks had grown tall. Swinging her axe, she cut down a dozen, plenty for each person at the dining table, with anything left over to be used in corn bread.  She had better remember to buy soda from Mister Cornish tomorrow.  The tomatoes were ripening.  After gathering the reddest three, May carried everything back into the kitchen.<br/><br/>By now Carmelita was chopping potatoes for the hash, to be mixed with some roast beef left over from Sunday.  May always encouraged her to be generous with the use of chili and Mexican herbs.  The guests may be white men, but they were also Westerners who would appreciate good cooking.  May sliced the bread that had been baked early that morning.  She sliced the tomatoes, and set everything out on the table.  For each man she dished up a bowl of beans with bacon, and set the bowls in place.<br/><br/>Wiping her brow with the corner of her clean white apron, May stepped out onto the porch to ring the BRASS triangle to summon the men to their mealtime.<br/><br/>Each in turn they filed in the door.  First tonight was Mister Scott, the carpenter with hair like yellow straw.  Then came two of the borax men who gave their names only as Melvin and Jim.  Mister Horace Jones came next. He had been a railroad brakeman until his right hand had been cut off in an accident between the rail cars.  Poor soul, what would become of him? May wondered inwardly.<br/><br/>She had a new guest tonight, a traveling salesman who had arrived on the train.  His name was Tom Lancaster.  <br/><br/>“Howdy, Ma’am,” he greeted her at the door with a smile.  “That railroad conductor told me to come to your house for the night.  He said your place was the cleanest in town, and you had the best cookin’.”<br/><br/>“Mister Lancaster, that is very kind. You are very welcome here. Please make yourself at home.  After supper, will you please leave fifty cents in this jar on the sideboard?”<br/><br/>“Yes, Ma’am, I surely will.”<br/><br/>The final half-dozen men had entered and seated themselves with the others at the table.  Some bowed their heads for a brief blessing. Some eyed the food greedily, ate rapidly and kept a watchful eye out for the possibility of second helpings.  May stood to the side, unobtrusively in the pantry, so that she could oversee the goings-on at the table without being in a position to be called on to serve. There was little talk, and what conversation there was centered on matters of business.  The borax men would depart early in the morning for Death Valley.<br/><br/>“Old Brigham the black mule come up lame,” said Melvin.  “I asked Dionisio at the stable about a replacement and he has that green broke gelding he got off a man last week.”<br/><br/>“Gelding?  Brown one?” asked Jim.  <br/><br/>They agreed that the horse would make a satisfactory replacement.  Back at the Greenland Ranch, Mister Perry had a big burro he thought would go with the team, as long as he was not in a position where he would need to jump the chain on the curves.  Heck, a burro was not smart enough to learn to do that.<br/><br/>“What’s that new engineer, Loomis, going to ride?” Jim wondered aloud.<br/><br/>“I heard Dionisio got him a ten year old army horse that was left by a cavalryman.  Should be fine if the animal is an easy keeper.”<br/><br/>“If that fellow is from Chicago, I wonder how much of a greenhorn he is.”<br/><br/>“Stiles told me yesterday that Loomis has done some work as a muleskinner.  We’ll see how it goes.  Seems like a solid fellow.”<br/><br/>The borax men retired to their beds, expecting to leave well before the daylight.  May wound the clock, as she did the same time each night.  <br/><br/>Some of the men offered thanks to May as they picked up their hats and returned to the town, probably headed for the saloon, she guessed.<br/><br/>Mister Lancaster, the “drummer,” lingered at the table and tried to interest her in the pens and paper that he carried in his valise.  May smiled kindly at him, but did not pause in her progress as she helped Carmelita collect the dishes from the table.  They carried everything back to Ignacio, Carmelita’s sister’s boy, who had proven to be an industrious dishwasher.<br/><br/>May wished a Carmelita good night, and the women retired to their separate quarters.  Carmelita had a room behind the kitchen.  May reserved for herself the attic room.  It was sometimes hot during the summer, yet cold in the winter,  But by opening the windows at either end, she could enjoy the sweeping view of desert hills and the low, green pathway that marked the course of the Mojave River.  One year, for several months on end, the surprising sight of a bright comet was there to be seen by all.  May marveled at this, and wondered what it might portend for her and for all humanity.<br/></p>

<p>This was it.</p>
<p>This was what Brad had been waiting for and planning for. This was what he knew was going to happen, what he had wanted to happen after feeling so goddamn alone for so long. Matt had been having success in the world, but him? He was nobody, had no income, had to mooch off his parents and little brother. Not that they minded, really; Matt had always welcomed Brad into his home and their parents were always loving and supportive, as they had been when Brad had come out as gay in high school. But the rest of the world wasn't so into that, and he couldn't even keep a job in food service because he was too damn depressed to function and greet customers. Matt was starting to get concerned, as were their parents, and Brad knew he had to do something before they tried to force him to get help... Again. He had refused each and every time, not wanting to take any more from them than he already had been. But it was getting close to them telling him that he needed help, and that wasn't going to happen.</p>

<p>Somewhere else in that city, a certain girl stood on a rooftop three stories above the alleys below, her wide eyes watching the lights fall from the sky. Before she could drift any further into amazed introspection, her phone rang in a pocket, which she answered with a flourishing hand movement. Even still, before her caller could utter a word, she began to speak. “Hey, are you seeing what I'm seeing?”<br/><br/>“Good, I was hoping you'd be outside too.” The voice on the other end sounded a bit relieved, its bell-like clarity still intact albeit having been sent over the airwaves. “Let me guess, are you on a roof?”<br/><br/>“Yep!” The rooftop girl spun once on her heel to prove a point to nobody in particular, her purple ponytail trailing behind her head as she rotated. “I mean, why not, right?”<br/><br/>The phone speaker somehow managed to preserve the silent nod and sigh from the other end of the line. “Just as I'd expected.” Not too soon after, the caller added, “Be careful up there.”<br/><br/>The spinning girl laughed as she brought herself to a stop, pushing her hair back over her shoulder. “Yeah, yeah, I know.” Her eyes pointed themselves at the sky again, watching what they could of the stars through cloud cover and light pollution. “Well, what do you think of that, then?”<br/><br/>“As the winds continue to blow and flowers fall from their lofty branches, petals become separated from their buds – but of course, those flowers fall together, and in groups.”<br/><br/>After a few seconds of laughter that echoed off the city block, the girl managed to eke out a few words of encouragement. “You're always so poetic, Rachel!” She wiped a tear from her eye as she made her way to the edge of the roof, dangling her legs over the side as someone yelled at her to quiet down.<br/><br/>“Well, I have to be, Marie.” No reception quality could possibly hide the fact that Rachel's words were delivered with a smile. “After all.”<br/><br/>“I guess, I guess... So, do you want me to stay out a while longer, then?” Marie swung her legs back and forth as she watched out for a stray cat stalking down the alley, looking for something to eat.<br/><br/>“No, that won't be necessary.” This time, Marie could swear that she heard her friend pushing some of her hair out of the way of her face. “How much longer do you have on your break?”<br/><br/>“It's just about to end, and then after that I have two more deliveries to make.” The alley cat down below managed to find the scraps of food that Marie had placed earlier, eliciting a smile from her face and a gentle rumble from her stomach. “Uh, d'you want me to pick something up from a shop while I'm still out? I guess I'm feeling kinda peckish.”<br/><br/>“No, it's fine, Claude's giving us some of the extras, which I will pick up after I'm done working with him today. Ah, one moment–”  A male voice with a heavy accent sounded in the background, before a few muffled words followed, sounding vaguely like an affirmative. One of Rachel's good habits was covering up the microphone when she was carrying on a conversation that required a raised voice – it was the little things that Marie, uh, appreciated about her good friend. “Hello, are you still there? How do you feel about smoked salmon and julienned carrot again?”<br/><br/>“Hmm.” A wistful smile began to form on the face of the purple-haired rooftop walker. “I dunno, Rachel, did you help make it?”<br/><br/>“Naturally, Marie.”<br/><br/>Marie smiled, mimicking the hair-pushing action that she could imagine Rachel having done earlier. “Y'know, that's the way to make it my favourite.” She scooted back from the precipice before standing up and looking around at the windows near the alley. “It sounds good to me! Give him my thanks, okay?”<br/><br/>“Of course. Stay safe out there.” Rachel's voice sounded more serious for a moment there, almost icy but warm, like a warm cup of tea having a few perfect cubes dropped into it to cool off.<br/><br/>“You too. See ya at home!” Marie closed the phone and checked the time before replacing it into her pocket, making sure to zip the pocket up. “And now,” she said to nobody in particular, “we begin the most interesting time of my life,” as she took several steps forward and walked off the roof. </p>

<p>(From an early draft)<br/><br/>She held the worn paper in her trembling hands, barely managing to unfold it. The sheet was tattered, smeared, and spattered with bloodstains over the black ink. She tried to gasp back her tears; they refused and broke through the wall she had defended for the past twelve years, mixing with the rain that slapped off the corrugated plastic roof overhead and fell to the granite stone at her feet.</p>
<p>Blair wiped her eyes with her sleeve and refocused as she began to read.</p>
<p>""If you're reading this, I've passed on. I didn't want to, believe me. I had plans, Blair. Big plans. I started this new life with the hope I could be a new man. A better man. For all the mileage I put on myself, for all the scars and the attempts at a cirrhotic liver, I didn't want to die. But here I am, gone from your life into whatever waits beyond. I never believed in love at first sight, but it didn't take me long to fall in love with you. It just took me too long to say it. Now I'll never get that chance--in person--and that is the one regret I leave in this world. I don't know how I went, but I'd like to think I slid in front of the Pearly Gates, beat all to hell, burned at the edges, bloodied and bruised, with the biggest crap-eating grin on my face. I might be gone, but believe me, you should see the other guy. I'm sure I killed him. I'm sorry I can't be there, even if you wouldn't ever cry on my shoulder. That was never you, and I'll bet it's that strength that's going to get you through this. Remember--""</p>
<p>The letter ended in a rained out smear that painted the bottom of the page in a marbled charcoal gray. Blair folded the letter closed and held it to her chest as she sat back, sobbing quietly into the noise of the rain and the distant thunder. The thousand-yard stare set in, numbing her to the quiet footsteps behind her.</p>
<p>""Remember I love you, and I always will. Vincent."" Jester grunted as he sat down next to Blair, a root beer in his bloodied, dirt-covered hand. He smelled like a sweaty campfire, and had several pieces of glass still embedded in his shoulder and the side of his face. Blood freely trickled down the side of his neck from behind his ear. He stared down at the root beer he held between his thighs in his lap.</p>
<p>""You know, we've been through Hell, Blair, but I think--given what we've been through--we did pretty well. So--""</p>
<p>Blair stared at Jester, trembling as she reached out for him, touching the side of his face. He winced in pain for a moment as she leaned against the wall to stand, looking down at Jester, her face a mixture of horror, surprise, uncertainty, and barely hopeful joy. Jester looked up at her as he struggled with his leg, dropping the root beer as he pulled his knee forward and propped himself on it.</p>
<p>""Are you--""</p>
<p>""Hurt? Badly. Alive? Barely. About to pass out? Probably. I just--"" Jester began digging in his pocket as Blair covered her mouth and wept. She leaned back against the wall, letting the tears flow before she tried to pull Jester to his feet. He resisted, still digging in his pocket. ""Before I pass out, I have a--a question."" He swayed on his knee, trying to remain conscious. ""Blair Treasa McDougall, will you marry me?""</p>
<p>And the world went black.</p>

Well, the stories go on and on to lead back to Aisling returning to live in California as a teenager with a distant cousin after both parents have died. The cousin is a member of a group of people interested in the occult and perks an interest Aisling to try to communicate with her deceased mother and father. Thus the title; Cemetery Girl.</p>

<p>My name is Liliana and I feel it's only fit that I have the opportunity to share my sidde of this story. I discovered her journals, the disconected and disjointed plumage of sheets of notebook paper and college essay books that she had been scribling in, I guess all during the time she's been living here in California, and well, my own wellbeing is at stake. I do not want to be brought up on charges of neglect in blame for what happened to her.</p><p> </p><p>Yes, she's dead now. But I don't want to talk about that yet. I am still in shock, as is everyone in the whole community around here, and yes, I've heard whispers of suspicion of how many think I am to blame for allowing her to slide into such a ruinous state of affairs. I was here, much of the time. I'll admit it, but I do not think that any evidence will be found of criminal neglect, or intent that would have led to her harm. Nothing that would stand in a court of law. I don't think so, at least. I hope not, at least. Worse, i'm subject to the never ending scrutiny of those that I work with here, but even worse than that is the gossip of those that will never understand why what happened, did.</p><p> </p><p>So where shall I begin. Do you want to hear me say that I'm a witch, and that I practice the dark arts? I won't admit to that, not so easily for you because any of us that ARE in fact witches, we don't label ourselves like that. I'm just an ordinary person that utilizes the skills and gifts that are inherently present in my life. If someone were to see me on the street, would they immediately say, ""God damn that woman looks like a witch!""? Hahah, on some days, depending on what I've been up to, and how I slept, whether I took much care in fixing how I looked, they might... but as far as the energy that emanates from my aura, I doubt that many people that are genuine strangers to me could discern that I am in fact a practitioner of ""dark arts"". All i do is breath. I breath through my days and follow the leadings of the things that arise in my mind. I work at things. I create things. I put actions into motion.</p><p> </p><p>Am I better at achieving the ideas that arise in my mind than someone that does not practice ""dark arts""? Maybe I am, and maybe I'm not. It's been a very strange year and I've been off my game. Sadly this tragedy that has befallen the dear girl Ashling may have turned out differently if I had been better on my game, but that is something that I am not willing to take full credit, or blame for. I had much bigger things going on than her simple confusions and insights.</p><p> </p><p>And she was not the only person that died recently that had their mind in places that they shouldn't have been thinking and worrying about. This is why I say the premonitions that I'm feeling scare me into thinking that the things I'm working on may lead to my demise. I've lost my center, my balance, my focus. There are forces greater than my own that have been at war with this family which have succeeded in bringing us down. That's what it really comes down to. That a fued has been occurring between our family and another. I hope to have time to go into enough detail about all of this so that whether or not my family is in the wrong or to blame or not, our side of the story will be told.</p><p> </p><p>Aishling was supposed to be an assistance to us here, but something so completely evil was set in motion by ""them"" that threw us all out of whack. We were not prepared for this. Too many of us have been individually stricken down by their attacks. And the alignements of the stars and planets has not been favorable for our success in fighting against them either. Yes, I fear that mine is the last story that will be told to explain what has happened, and I'll go into as much detail as I am physically and mentally able to tell you.</p><p> </p><p>Who, and what I am, and perhaps a little bit of an idea of how I got to be where I am today. I was born with a crooked spine and had six toes on my left foot. My mother was not a witch but she was a bit of an herbalist, and naturalist. She enjoyed nature and spent as much time in it's realms as was possible. Having the deformities I was born with was pretty much genetically blamed on a job she got working in a polluted lake in Southern California. She was assigned a temporary job taking samples of water at the Salton Sea, but her wild nature got the best of her, and well, when her official work shifts were over she'd go skinny dipping in the waters. Told me that she had some idea in her head that the ""natural chemicals"" were beneficial for the skin condition she had. She knew full well that the chemists and biologists she was working with believed that there was something NOT GOOD about the waters, but she followed her own intuition and tried to defy science. Yes, that was the kind of woman my mother was. One that belived in whims, not logic. At first the condition with her skin improved, but that was only temporary. It was more her spirit that healed from the frolicking in nature, but the psoriasis worsened, then stabilized, and she kept it a secret from everyone. She also followed her intuition and made love on a full moonlit night and conceived me. That man was not interested in her though. Not for a long term commitment anyway.</p><p> </p><p>She told me that she felt it was very important that she become pregnant with me when she did, that there were signs that appeared in her dreams. That the dreams are what led her to believe in the need to swim in the toxic waters. Those waters seeped in deeper than skin deep though. They infected me, inside her womb, and well, deformed the development of my wee fetus causing secret and strange things to happen to me. Am I upset with her for what happened to me? I was called a freak by kids all my life because I could not stand up straight, but it made me stronger inside. And no one EVER got to see my special foot. I've only dared to share this with you now because I want to be understood. I don't want there to be any doubt in your mind that what I am is special beyond the norm.</p><p> </p><p>I wish I could tell you things about the man that helped create me but all I know are the half memories that she shared with me. She did not even date the guy. He was a musician, part of a band that lived down in a desert near the Salton Sea. She only referred to him as The Captain. I wish she had liked him, well, loved him. I wish I could have known him. But my mom, oh, she preferred to not allow anyone to have power over her decision making. She liked being boss, even if she was not a good one.</p><p> </p><p>My mother also had a knack for story telling, and she told me so many stories I don't know what to believe anymore. See, I lived alone with her. I had no reason to believe that I had siblings, but she told me that I did. That there were six other children that she gave birth to - all boys, but that they had all been made to go live with other people. I never saw any of them in person. She had photos of who these boys were, and told me that she got to see them if she was sneaky enough to not get caught by the fathers. Like my mom was a surrogate, or something... a birthing machine out for hire. Sad and scary, huh? I pretended that I knew my brothers. I acted like they were my imaginary friends and that I could talk with them. The scary thing is that I really, really did believe this. I had my own names for them - she never told me their real names. In fact, she never spoke about them again other than when she initially told me they existed. That was all I needed. They came to life inside of my mind and heart and I nurtured my friendship with them, invisibly. i would have dreams in which I could see what was happening in their lives and I would act out in my dreams doing things to help them. I'm not going to go into explicit detail about who they were, not now at least. I just want to let you know that I had strengths to do things that I suspected that normal people could not do. And by that I mean that if I did not read in any stories or books about things that happened like I experienced I believed that no one else could do them. I was special. My chemical deformed birth gave me special powers.</p><p> </p><p>For the most part I've never been mean, nor have I acted maliciously towards others. Sure, there has been plenty of reason to think that people deserved payback, but I somehow grew up believing that everyone had deformities. And that if you could not see the deformities in someone's external being, the deformities were inside of them. Otherwise why would beautiful people have reason to be cruel to less fortunate beings. Why would normal, pretty looking people act cruelly towards people that were not as perfectly beautiful as they were if they were not cursed with some internal deformity that made them mean. It was the only thing that made sense. So I ended up being the kind of person that did not fight back when I was treated cruelly, but tried to be loving instead. I'd let them keep hitting me, or spitting at me, or throwing food at me and would not report them to the teachers. It wasn't that their attacks did not hurt me, what hurt me more was imagining how awful they felt inside of themselves that they had to pick on someone less fortunate. This was how I learned the power of prayer - or the invisible transmission of healing energy from my heart. See? This is not evil behavior is it? I am indeed a witch, but I am a white witch, because I use the powers of my heart and mind to do good for others.</p><p> </p><p>I learned eventually too that there were things I could do that would make myself more attractive to those that felt a need to abuse me. I mean, I could lessen the severity of the attacks on me if I became more like them. If I prettied up my appearance, they did not hate me as much. If I made my hair nice, if I wore nice clothes. it was a temporary experience though, one that showed me the variety of strengths that external actions could arouse. Okay, where am I going with this...  When I got older, in my teens and my body changed, I became able to attract men to myself. Even though I was deformed, oh, and yes, my crooked stature became more and more intense as I aged. There were the parts of me that were of attraction to men, men wanted to touch me, and I allowed a few to do it, just to see what it would be like. It was of no benefit to me though. I mean that they did not help me increase my powers. I thought that they would but their actions were rough and unkind. They said mean things to me when they would use me and it did not give me good feelings about myself. So after a few experiences like that I decided that I would not engage in physical acts with other people anymore. My power, my core, my special abilities were too important to not let be weakened. My invisible brothers were more important, helping them, than letting strangers experience wasted joy.</p><p> </p><p>Contrarily, I did find enjoyment in using those powers of my body and started to experiment with expressing my sexuality in nature. I lived in a small town in Northern California and was able to get into nature alone easily. There were fields and  orchards not far from where I lived. In fact, I'd just have to go outside our house into an orchard behind our property.. well, the favorite things were when I could ride my bike out fo the neighborhood to a special grove. it was special because i saw things happen there in my dreams. the field behind the house was okay but the grove was better. it was charmed. i'd lie and tell my mom that i was going to the library, and yes, i was not so deformed that i was physically incapacitated and could not ride a bike. it was not easy, and i could not go far or fast, but it was probably the most liberating, normal experience that I could take part in. getting away to this grove was like a sacrament for me. it was private enough that i could walk around and talk out loud and i'd know that no one could hearr me.</p><p> </p><p>It was a long time before I became brave enoough to be naked there, but that was what was most empowering for me. when i was natural in nature, my powers increased.</p>

<p>NOTES, REFERENCE MATERIAL, TO BE SIFTED THROUGH...</p>

<p>Imitation, leadership, and the role of the trickster[<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liminality&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8"">edit</a>]</p>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimesis"">Mimesis</a>, or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitation"">imitative</a> aspect of human behavior, is an important aspect of liminality.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-60"">[60]</a></sup> Individuals who are trapped in a liminal situation are not able to act rationally for two reasons: “first, because the structure on which ‘objective’ rationality was-- based has disappeared; and second, because the stressful, emotive character of a liminal crisis prevents clear thinking”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-61"">[61]</a></sup> This can lead to “mimetic” behavior on the part of the trapped individuals: “a central characteristic of liminal situations is that, by eliminating the stable boundary lines, they contribute to the proliferation of imitative processes and thus to the continuous reproduction of dominant messages about what to copy”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-62"">[62]</a></sup> Without stable institutions (which are effectively broken down in a liminal period), “people will look at concrete individuals for guidance”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-63"">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>This notion of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitation"">imitation</a> is closely tied to that of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickster"">trickster</a> figure. The trickster is a universal figure that can be found in folktales and myths of nearly all cultures. These tricksters can be characterized as follows:</p>
<p>[they] are always marginal characters: outsiders, as they cannot trust or be trusted, cannot give or share, they are incapable of living in a community; they are repulsive, as – being insatiable – they are characterized by excessive eating, drinking, and sexual behavior, having no sense of shame; they are not taken seriously, given their affinity with jokes, storytelling, and fantasizing.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-64"">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the context of liminality, the trickster is a very dangerous figure: “in a liminal situation where certainties are lost, imitative behavior escalates, and tricksters can be mistaken for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_authority"">charismatic leaders</a>”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-65"">[65]</a></sup> This means that in their search for guidance, the individuals caught in the liminal situation might choose to follow a trickster, whom they confuse with a charismatic leader capable of “saving” them. Liminal periods that affect entire societies are characterized by the absence of a “master of ceremonies” (the leadership figures that are supposed to lead the initiands out of the liminal phase), which can in turn lead to the rise of tricksters into positions of power. When a trickster enters into a position of leadership, “liminality will not be restricted to a temporary crisis, followed by a return to normality, but can be perpetuated endlessly”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-66"">[66]</a></sup> This can be explained by three important characteristics of the trickster: his lack of a home (the trickster is, by definition, homeless and an outsider), lack of deeply felt human relations, and lack of existential commitments.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-67"">[67]</a></sup> These traits cause the trickster to have no interest in solving the liminal crisis; “on the contrary, being really at home in liminality, or in homelessness, his real interest lies in its opposite, in perpetuating such conditions of confusion”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-68"">[68]</a></sup>On the other hand, the trickster is also a mime. “Imitation, whether in learning or in social activity, is only possible in so far as we are not aware that we are actually imitating…because as soon as we do so, imitation becomes a mere miming and would produce no effect in learning or no pleasure in involvement”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-69"">[69]</a></sup> Seeing as the trickster is incapable of “experiencing learning or the pleasure of sociability” as others do, he can be considered a mime rather than an imitator.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-70"">[70]</a></sup> He thus appears to act just as everyone else does. With this in mind, there are “two characteristics [of the trickster] that under certain conditions could turn to be profitable, even [leading him to gain] unlimited and total power”: “his permanent state of exteriority helps him to think rationally and makes him a good mime: he cannot learn by genuine imitation but learns how to mime others and this produces laughter; thus he receives appreciation that otherwise he would never obtain”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-71"">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>The term <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schismogenesis"">schismogenesis</a>, developed by British anthropologist <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson"">Gregory Bateson</a>, can be used to describe situations of permanent liminality. Through this concept, Bateson suggested “that societies can be stuck for a long time in a state where the previous unity was broken, and yet the schismatic components are forced to stay together, producing an unpleasant, violent, harrowing, truly miserable existence”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-72"">[72]</a></sup> Bateson further suggested that “entire cultures might systematically produce schizoid personalities” and, by combining such an idea with the work of Turner and anthropologist <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard"">René Girard</a>, one could say that the trickster is capable of founding such a culture. Girard’s concept of mimetic desire (and, more importantly, the phenomenon he called the “mimetic crisis”) can be linked to the trickster and to absence of masters of ceremonies in large-scale instances of liminality:</p>
<p>When a mimetic crisis is artificially staged in the ritual process, it always happens in the presence of a “master of ceremonies” who maintains order once the stabilities of everyday life are dissolved in the rites of separation. When the schism takes place in real life, however, it is not certain that charismatic heroes emerge that are up to solving the situation through eidetic perception, in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato"">Platonic</a> sense.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-73"">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>In any normal situation, the trickster would not be able to gain any appreciation from others, but in a crisis situation (which, as an outsider, the trickster has no emotional connections to), “might come up with a rational way of ‘solving’ the crisis by turning things into his own image”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-74"">[74]</a></sup> It is precisely in these situations that “schismatic doubling and copying are escalated, and the erratic, even repulsive, becomes normal”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-75"">[75]</a></sup> Once others become aware of the true nature of the trickster’s behavior, it “becomes a genuine problem as a trickster character cannot be altered, so there is genuinely no solution”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-76"">[76]</a></sup> It is also not possible for the trickster figure to be punished, as “punishment is only meaningful if there is a chance of correction and improvement, which is hopeless in the case of a trickster character”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-77"">[77]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some examples of trickster figures of 20th century politics include <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler"">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini"">Benito Mussolini</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin"">Vladimir Lenin</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin"">Joseph Stalin</a>.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-78"">[78]</a></sup> Szakolczai describes what can happen when such tricksters emerge in positions of power:</p>
<p>When trickster figures are mistaken for saviors, then emotions will be continually and repeatedly incited, until the community is reduced to a schismatic state. Societies can maintain themselves in such situations of oppression and violence for a long time, without returning to normal order, if stable external referent points are absent. This is why schismogenic societies need to maintain themselves in a perpetual state of war; presumably surrounded by enemies who try to conquer and destroy them.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-79"">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus the culture that is established by such tricksters following their rise to power “can have its structure and persistence, as the negative sentiments of hatred, hostility, fear and envy, based on vital instincts of self-preservation, can indeed maintain in the long term a social order in a relative state of stability”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-80"">[80]</a></sup> But in addition, this same society would “preserve, forever, its broken, fragmented, schismatic character”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-81"">[81]</a></sup></p>

Through this concept, Bateson suggested “that societies can be stuck for a long time in a state where the previous unity was broken, and yet the schismatic components are forced to stay together, producing an unpleasant, violent, harrowing, truly miserable existence”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-72"">[72]</a></sup> Bateson further suggested that “entire cultures might systematically produce schizoid personalities” and, by combining such an idea with the work of Turner and anthropologist <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard"">René Girard</a>, one could say that the trickster is capable of founding such a culture. Girard’s concept of mimetic desire (and, more importantly, the phenomenon he called the “mimetic crisis”) can be linked to the trickster and to absence of masters of ceremonies in large-scale instances of liminality:</p><p>When a mimetic crisis is artificially staged in the ritual process, it always happens in the presence of a “master of ceremonies” who maintains order once the stabilities of everyday life are dissolved in the rites of separation. When the schism takes place in real life, however, it is not certain that charismatic heroes emerge that are up to solving the situation through eidetic perception, in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato"">Platonic</a> sense.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-73"">[73]</a></sup></p><p>In any normal situation, the trickster would not be able to gain any appreciation from others, but in a crisis situation (which, as an outsider, the trickster has no emotional connections to), “might come up with a rational way of ‘solving’ the crisis by turning things into his own image”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-74"">[74]</a></sup> It is precisely in these situations that “schismatic doubling and copying are escalated, and the erratic, even repulsive, becomes normal”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-75"">[75]</a></sup> Once others become aware of the true nature of the trickster’s behavior, it “becomes a genuine problem as a trickster character cannot be altered, so there is genuinely no solution”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-76"">[76]</a></sup> It is also not possible for the trickster figure to be punished, as “punishment is only meaningful if there is a chance of correction and improvement, which is hopeless in the case of a trickster character”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-77"">[77]</a></sup></p><p>Some examples of trickster figures of 20th century politics include <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler"">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini"">Benito Mussolini</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin"">Vladimir Lenin</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin"">Joseph Stalin</a>.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-78"">[78]</a></sup> Szakolczai describes what can happen when such tricksters emerge in positions of power:</p><p>When trickster figures are mistaken for saviors, then emotions will be continually and repeatedly incited, until the community is reduced to a schismatic state. Societies can maintain themselves in such situations of oppression and violence for a long time, without returning to normal order, if stable external referent points are absent. This is why schismogenic societies need to maintain themselves in a perpetual state of war; presumably surrounded by enemies who try to conquer and destroy them.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-79"">[79]</a></sup></p><p>Thus the culture that is established by such tricksters following their rise to power “can have its structure and persistence, as the negative sentiments of hatred, hostility, fear and envy, based on vital instincts of self-preservation, can indeed maintain in the long term a social order in a relative state of stability”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-80"">[80]</a></sup> But in addition, this same society would “preserve, forever, its broken, fragmented, schismatic character”.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-81"">[81]</a></sup></p>

Donned in black clothing, darkness loomed over her, blackness was her. It was etched on her pinched lips, woven in her hair; it leaked on her clothes and was painted on stiletto fingernails. She moved in a swarming way, as if to cover all of the ground she could with her hypnotizing movements. Like oil, she left a trace of murkiness; she skimmed, hypnotized final thoughts with each movement.</p>

<p><em>Soho, New York City - 2015 - Just remember this picture, we'll get back to it in a moment or two.</em><br/><br/>I normally stay out of this particular conversation because it makes people uncomfortable. Mostly me. But today I am going to go with the idea this is a troll seeking to provoke controversy and I am going to lay the smackdown on this idea once and for all, political correctness, be damned.<br/><br/><strong>Once upon a time:</strong></p>
<p><img src=""https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-82a290bba424bada63620a10a89c58cb?convert_to_webp=true""/></p>
<p><br/>There was a nation known for its less than ideal treatment of what it deemed minority members of their population. These populations hadn't done anything wrong other than exist. There were many social issues around these populations, particularly how they came to be in this nation.<br/><br/>There was much inherent and underlying cultural shame in their being brought to this nation, why they were brought here, the wars fought over their being here and ultimately their release from four hundred years of chattel slavery at the hands of one of American history's bloodiest wars.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img src=""https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d102bf465a94a0a865b0408a08fc136e?convert_to_webp=true""/></p>
<p><br/>As much as we like to pretend this distasteful part of American history didn't happen, and revisionists work daily to change its inherent meaning, causation and outcomes, the truth stands. The Civil War was fought over the maintenance of slaves and the Slave State. <br/><br/>What made it worse was once those minorities were released from bondage, they weren't allowed to have a piece of the pie. They weren't eagerly embraced by those who wronged them for centuries. They were falsely imprisoned, ostracized, marginalized, segregated and even attacked for decades after their so-called freedom had been obtained. This was not a good time for anyone who wasn't deemed ""White"" in America.<br/><br/></p>

<p><br/>At the same time this was going on:</p>
<p><img src=""https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cf4964156f1941a3004d6fb699fcf7c9?convert_to_webp=true""/></p>
<p><em>Birmingham, 1963: A 17 year old is attacked by police dogs during a Civil Rights peaceful protest.</em><br/><br/>This was going on:</p>

<p><em>The mighty Avengers were foiling the threat of Loki.</em><br/><br/>Now ask yourself: this new mythology of superheroes, heroic legends fighting newly created monsters of science and old mythology wasn't spawned in a vacuum. These new heroes, related distantly to their 1940 predecessors, were created by White men who had the opportunity and lack of socialized constraints to write these creations who would become legendary in American culture. <br/><br/>These legends weren't spawned in a place where people were not affected by the social and cultural mores of the world around them. In fact, they were a reflection of that world, as those writers and artists saw it and encouraged to make it so.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, do you believe it could be possible that the world that would attack Black people on the street with dogs would empower the same marginalized people with worlds of fantasy and power when the culture they lived in wanted nothing to do with them?</li>
<li>That they would have been given an opportunity to show up empowered, able to challenge the status quo, alter the perspectives of White America and be seen as equal both in the real world and this mythic one?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Not a chance in hell.</strong><br/><br/></p>

<p>The very nature of the hypocrisy is such that a character created by Modern Marvel uses this very theme as part of his origin story!</p>
<blockquote>In 1962, Adam Brashear received the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom"">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> from President <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy"">John F. Kennedy</a> on the day the President asked him to retire, since it had been discovered by the public that he is an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American"">African-American</a>. As the Blue Marvel, Brashear wore a full-face helmet, but when it was damaged in a battle, his identity was revealed. There was massive controversy as the era of 1962 was too <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"">racist</a> to accept a black superhero. Although Kennedy personally approved of Brashear's actions, the President reluctantly decided to ask Brashear to step down, and the Blue Marvel conceded.</blockquote>
<p>So we are clear on the subject: This hero did not exist in 1962! He was NOT part of Marvel's lineup of heroes and did not predate the first appearance of Marvel's first African superhero, the Black Panther (appearing in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four""><em>Fantastic Four</em></a> #52, July 1966), nor the first African American superhero, the high-flying Falcon (appearing in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America""><em>Captain America</em></a> #117, Sept. 1969).<br/><br/>This retcon was created to explain why this particular powerful metahuman was not fighting crime at the same time the Fantastic Four was supposedly experiencing their origin story in midtown Manhattan. <br/><br/>Marvel used the specter of racism to explain retroactively why there weren't more heroes of color in their lineup of mythological beings who could have been any color but were almost exclusively White.<br/><br/><strong>This is not an apology, mind you. But it's as close as Marvel will ever get. </strong><br/><br/>Black superheroes in the Marvel Universe were already rare. Powerful ones, beings capable of competing with the likes of Thor, Iron Man and the Hulk, were non-existent until the creation of Storm, the mutant weather-manipulator who appeared in Giant X-men #1 in 1975. And she would not grow truly formidable for another fifteen years, give or take.<br/><br/></p>

<p><strong>What does this have to do with race-bending and gender-bending in comics and media today?</strong></p>
<p><br/>What this has to do with and why so many fans rage against the change is simple and has to do with the very first picture in this article. The world we live in does not resemble the ideal world of White America, where everyone is White, minorities are not seen, and the hegemony of White power is omnipresent in this nation.<br/><br/>Instead it looks far more like Soho in that first picture.<br/><br/>Diverse, mixed, people of all sorts of colors, cultures, social groups and religions populate the nation's largest cities. While the economic power of Whites has continued to grow, their numbers are slowly being eroded and this ultimately means their social cache, their influence, their dominance over all forms of media will also be reduced. But it may take some time.<br/><br/>As media continues to develop, however, the people who are paying to see movies being made already know what many media companies are unwilling to accept.<br/><br/><strong>If all of your heroes stay White, you will lose your audience. </strong><br/><strong>Maybe not today, but as you transition toward the future, this will become an unacceptable circumstance.</strong><br/><br/>Here's where the problem lies. <br/><br/><strong>The fans will say: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>But those heroes were always White.</li>
<li>Why is it a problem now?</li>
<li>We should stay true to the canon.</li>
<li>We should just make new heroes for those minorities to aspire to instead of changing the established ones.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/><strong>My response is simple: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get over yourself and check your privilege at the door.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We don't live in the racially-segmented, culturally-insensitive, radically-offensive time of your fathers and grandfathers.</li>
<li>While it may have been considered acceptable to pretend Black people couldn't be anything other than slaves, servants or entertainers in 1940s, 1950s or 1960s, it is now considered the very soul of racism to continue to promote those ideas today.</li>
<li>If these entertainments were created in 1960s I would expect to see an all-white superhero team because Blacks and other minorities were simply excluded from any form of media that didn't portray them in a negative light.</li>
<li>This is the year of our Lord, 2015. We are supposed to be better than this. What we say we are supposed to want, equality and an egalitarian society should be reflected in our workplaces, our streets and in our media. It should be reflected in the hopes and aspirations of all of our citizens not just our White ones.</li>
<li>All of our children should have the opportunity to see themselves represented mythically, as idealized constructs, the same way White men have been allowed to do since such media came into existence.</li>
</ul>
<p>And don't get it twisted. I recognize the world we live in is still very racially divided. There is still murder and mayhem based on color, religion, culture all over the globe and it is unfortunately not likely to change to the more idealized perspective to which I am espousing. I get that.<br/><br/>But if you tell me it is okay to say, there should never be any representation of people of marginalized groups: women, LGBT, Black, Asian, just to start, and every movie, every television show, every newscast should feature exclusively White men in positions of power and authority...<br/><br/>You have a problem. And you should get some help. Look back at that picture of Soho.<br/><br/></p>

<p><br/>This is the future. This is the world we will slowly come to have everywhere. Different regions will have different mixtures but we are mixing. We are recombining to form new relationships with each other.<br/><br/>And as such, we are asking...no we are demanding our media, our entertainment, to reflect a viewpoint that is not only White or male (of which comic companies are all to unwilling to change) but that it be about something other than White male stereotypes of superiority.</p>
<p><br/><br/>Two of Marvel's hottest properties are the new Ms. Marvel, Kamala Khan and Jane Foster as Thor.</p>

<p>These relatively minor roles have caused the comic and movie fanbase to boycott the publications, stay home from the movies, and rail online as if Ragnarök itself were around the corner. They scream as loud as their tortured voiceboxes will allow: How could this happen? Why would you do this?<br/><br/><strong>The question should be: Why has it taken so long for anyone to notice the lack? It's right in front of you.</strong></p>

<p>It will be nearly twenty of Marvel's newest movies before a woman or a Black lead character will be featured. Really? <br/><br/>Has it taken this long to recognize there is a problem? Or is it just White privilege which prevents anyone from seeing the problem. Because to them, there isn't one. <br/><br/><strong>This is how its always been. </strong><br/><br/>That, my friends, IS the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>And if you are one of those people railing against change,</li>
<li>railing against a diverse representation of people of color appearing in roles they have previously not been seen in,</li>
<li>if you are indeed saying only Whites can be superheroic,</li>
<li>you are the problem with our world today.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps you should stop going outside. Stop going to the movies. Stop doing anything which puts you in contact with anyone else. Because the ideal world represented in the racially-insensitive, but oh so popular series, Mad Men, is gone.</p>

<p>If you are young enough, you may have never heard about Hal until recently because this Black Green Lantern, <a href=""http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Lantern_(John_Stewart)""><strong>John Stewart</strong></a>, was all the rage in the animated series, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League_(TV_series)""><strong>Justice League</strong></a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League_Unlimited""><strong>Justice League Unlimited</strong></a>. For nearly a decade and ninety episodes, give or take, he was the only Green Lantern some had ever known.</p>

<p>In recent years, and in the terribly irresponsible <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1133985/"">Green Lantern (2011)</a>, Hal Jordan was returned to prominence, likely for the same reason most White heroes who get replaced for a time do, because the rabid, foaming at the mouth, comic-buying fan base said: We want him back. <br/><br/>Was this because John Stewart wasn't good enough? Certainly didn't seem to be a problem for nearly a decade or more. In fact, John Stewart as Green Lantern, was a necessary change for DC to have any diversity in their major lineup of heroes at all.</p>

<p><br/>The same case could be made for the change in Johnny Storm, portrayed by Michael B. Jordan in the recent Fantastic Four movie.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img src=""https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-71648abf39819836a21542a901da3e48?convert_to_webp=true""/><br/>Storm being a step-brother to Susan Richards, doesn't inherently change the quartet's dynamic. A change that is not a change, isn't a change. He's still the same character, with the same powers, with a slightly altered origin story. Is this a reason to lose one's mind?<br/><br/><strong>Only if you think you are losing something else instead. </strong><br/><br/>Perhaps the misguided belief that only Whites should have power. Because if you look at the history of metahumans in comics and note that no one has a problem with a White guy having incredible, unbelievable power. There doesn't seem to be any lack of them.</p>
<p><img src=""https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2b0ddb8611df4089e9004964d964ec2b?convert_to_webp=true""/><br/>But the history of comics shows that few, if any such characters of equal power or capacity were ever regularly depicted as heroes of color representing any social group outside of Whites. And when they do have power equal to Whites, it doesn't last long. <br/><br/>Monica Rambeau was such a character. When she first hit the scene in the Avengers, she was the second person to ever carry the name Captain Marvel (1982).</p>

<ul>
<li>When she first hit the scene, her powers were so great, she was considered to be one of the most powerful Avengers to EVER exist. But it didn't take long for Marvel to change that.</li>
<li>Yes, I said Marvel. It was the decision of writers, editors and publishers who made the changes to the character. It was a conscious choice.</li>
<li>Not only was she stripped of the powers that made her the equal of ANY Avenger including Thor, but she was stripped of her codename as well and she became Photon.</li>
<li>Far less powerful and less interesting, she was eventually benched and disappeared from view until her recent reappearance in Mighty Avengers and returned to her previous power level by no less than the same Black hero who supposedly hid away for 53 years, Blue Marvel...</li>

<p><em>Now, she is as powerful as she was before. At least until those aforementioned 'side effects' kick in... For a bit more insight into Monica Rambeau: </em><a href=""http://io9.com/the-unfortunate-and-obscure-history-of-monica-rambeau-1726108988""><em>The Unfortunate and Obscure History of Monica Rambeau, the First Female Captain Marvel</em></a><br/><br/><strong>You have to remember, all of the decisions made about these characters depends on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Whether they get good writers or not</li>
<li>Whether a writer who may be sensitive to the social lifestyle of the character (i.e. women writers, or writers of color) ever has a chance to write the book, and indeed this is invariably NOT the case.</li>
<li>Whether the effort to ensure the successful deployment of said characters is made</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things are decided by the producers and publishers of said characters. You can be assured every issue of Thor was not a good one. There are plenty of times his book did not sell well, for extended periods. And there are times when his book might even go off the shelves, briefly.<br/><br/>The difference is: Marvel didn't give up on trying to find an audience for him. They were certain they could sell his book. So they kept trying.<br/><br/><strong>This is why Thor is still on the shelves sixty years later and Luke Cage is not.</strong><br/><br/>Is Thor inherently more interesting? No. But significantly more effort is made to keep him on the shelves. <br/><br/><strong>By any means necessary. (I'm sorry, Malcolm X, but it's appropriate in this instance.)</strong><br/><br/>The reason we don't see new heroes of color is because no one is making the effort to create them. No one has decided there needs to be one or two or eight. They currently don't see any value in diversity.<br/><br/><strong>Or maybe because the creators of comics enjoy the same level of privilege their comic counterparts get and just don't want it to change.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What about a Latino Superhero?*</strong></p>
<p><br/>What about it? There haven't been many of them. Goodness knows there should have been more by now. In old school comics, there may have been one or two, but I have to think hard to remember: Superfriends had one, but he appeared in less than ten episodes, and I was never truly clear about what his powers were. These characters got so little screen time between the four of them, any mainstream Superfriend could equal their total time in a single episode.</p>
<p><img src=""https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a396f0df7a3c51d18a2c90ac01747434?convert_to_webp=true""/></p>
<p>Apache Chief would later go on to an episode of Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law and get more screen time there than he did during his entire time with the Superfriends.</p>
<p><img src=""https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9e2554fb8218a58136341aaaeee07093?convert_to_webp=true""/><br/>A few other Latinos of note among DC. Fire, appearing in Superfriends #25 and reappearing in the Global Guardians and Justice League. A second stringer for most of her career.</p>
<p><img src=""https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a0edd22f459f2ad1ac9082b11d4b24f0?convert_to_webp=true""/><br/>Then I remember Vibe (far right), a break-dancing member of Justice League Detroit during the comic's less popular eras. <br/><br/>The legacy heroes replacing both the Question (Renee Montoya) and Wildcat (Yolanda Montez) of DC Comics. Both Latina women and both characters languished in obscurity for the most part.<br/><br/></p>

<p><strong>Are there any famous Latino superheroes?</strong><br/>There may be others, but the most famous one I know is most likely NOT KNOWN as a Mexican-American. His name is Kyle Rayner. You may know him as the legacy hero, Green Lantern.</p>
<blockquote>Kyle Rayner was a struggling-but-gifted freelance <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_artist"">graphic artist</a> who was raised in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood"">North Hollywood</a> and currently lived and worked in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"">Los Angeles</a>. Kyle was raised by his mother as an only child; his father abandoned his mother when she was pregnant. It was later revealed that his father was a Mexican-American CIA agent named Gabriel Vasquez and that Aaron Rayner was merely an alias.</blockquote>
<p><img src=""https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3bbc6c29c9a071cccc5bc4e3cf8caa1b?convert_to_webp=true""/></p>
<p><br/>Kyle Rayner would become Green Lantern after Hal Jordan destroys the Green Lantern Corps during one of his many periods of remorse over one such thing or another. At this time, the Guardian, Ganthet, makes Kyle the custodian of the Last Green Lantern and Ring in the universe. Kyle eventually masters the ring and begins rebuilding the Corps.<br/><br/>Kyle Rayner would go on to be considered one of the most powerful Green Lanterns of Sector 2814, possibly one of the most powerful Green Lanterns ever. He would be instrumental in saving the Green Lantern Corps, he would master every color of the Emotional Spectrum, save the Guardians of Oa and nearly all of space-time itself. I am willing to bet, most people don't know he is considered Mexican-American.<br/><br/><strong>And here in lies the lesson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A hero goes only as far as his writers and editors are willing to take him. The idea that heroes of color sell less well, are less viable, and inherently less interesting is BS.</li>
<li>Considering the War of Light series for Green Lantern is a high point in the series entire career, and it stars Kyle Rayner.</li>
<li>Before Kyle's example, there were few minority characters given the opportunity to shine at the level he has. He has proven instrumental and as capable as any White hero before him.</li>
<li>Even heroes such as the Green Lantern, John Stewart, were depicted unevenly and were more often failures than successes. The destruction of the planet Xanshi is laid at John Stewart's feet. Millions died due to his hubris. And he is never allowed to forget it:</li>

<p><br/>And there is this one other half-Black, half-Latino fellow who has recently gathered a bit of fame: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(Miles_Morales)""><strong>Miles Morales</strong></a>. You might know him better as the Ultimate Spider-Man (of Earth 1610).<br/><br/>If you don't know who Miles Morales is, you better get caught up because he is going to be a part of the new Marvel Universe and a member of the newest team of Avengers. </p>

<p><strong>Summary:  </strong></p>
<p>The dominant subculture in control of the media knows one thing, if it isn't aware of anything else:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images are powerful.</li>
<li>Media is powerful.</li>
<li>It shapes minds.</li>
<li>It alters consciousness.</li>
<li>It inspires.</li>
<li>It changes the dreams of everyone who interacts with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If media and advertising didn't work to do these things, would we spend hundreds of billions of dollars every year worldwide, to keep making it? Absolutely not.<br/><br/><strong>In media, the rule is: Perception is Reality.</strong><br/><br/>Think of comics and movie depictions of superheroes as advertising for the imagination. <br/><br/>When you hear the litany of society saying Blacks or minorities don't aspire to anything, I have to wonder:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they saw more of themselves reflected in their media,</li>
<li>If they saw themselves as able to transform the world,</li>
<li>If they saw themselves as instrumental in the shaping of today's world,</li>
<li>If they saw themselves being portrayed in media in a positive light instead of always in orange jumpsuits and handcuffs,</li>
<li>if they saw themselves the same way White children get to see themselves portrayed in media, maybe it could make a difference for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maybe it could teach them and inspire them the same way Action #1 inspired a generation or two including mine.</strong></p>

<p>This clamor for representation is not about ""political correctness"". It is about the understanding that media can shape consciousness. If you alter media to falsely represent society, then you are responsible for intentionally undermining any group you falsely represent there.<br/><br/>People are tired of that. Fanboys notwithstanding, People have had enough of misrepresentation. Do better or lose future audiences. People aren't sitting on their hands anymore. Change is coming.<br/><br/></p>

It was one of the first major production companies featuring diverse lineups of multiple minorities as lead characters.</p>
<blockquote>

<li>It was founded in 1993 by a coalition of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"">African-American</a> artists and writers (namely <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwayne_McDuffie"">Dwayne McDuffie</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denys_Cowan"">Denys Cowan</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Davis_(comics)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"">Michael Davis</a>and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Derek_T._Dingle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"">Derek T. Dingle</a>) who believed that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_minority"">minorities</a> were severely underrepresented in American comics. Milestone Media was their attempt to correct this imbalance.</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Priest_(comics)"">Christopher Priest</a> participated in the early planning stages of Milestone Media, and was originally slated to become the editor-in-chief of the new company, but bowed out for personal reasons before any of Milestone's titles were published.</li>
<li>By early 1995, Davis had left Milestone as well, to become President of the new <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Motown_Machine_Works_imprint&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"">Motown Machine Works imprint</a>, published by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Comics"">Image Comics</a>.

<ul>
<li>The shockwaves in the comic industry lead by these prominent African American writers has never been equaled and even when Milestone and its characters were absorbed by DC Comics, it was never forgotten.</li>

244,ebonstorm,Novel: The Aspect War,Genre: Fantasy,50557,"1,685",0,"
<p>The Aspect of Death, one of the most powerful of the Primal forces of our world, has gone missing and has been succeeded by his far-less-powerful second, the enigmatic Director of Death, Incorporated. Without the Aspect of Death to defend his dominion, it may fall prey to more opportunistic Aspects. The last time this happened, the Black Plague was unleashed and set the Second Worlds afire with war...<br/><br/>Meanwhile, an army gathers at the borders of the Realms between Earth and Avalon, the Selig and Ur-Selig Courts have reluctantly joined forces in an effort to return to Earth. Having been banished by the Compact, a divine restriction created nearly fifteen hundred years ago that banished the Cold Gods and their allies, the Selig Court, from the Realms of Man. Now under attack from a new enemy, the Cold Gods, and the Selig Courts are forced to retreat to Earth as their Realm falls to an unstoppable force...<br/><br/>The Angels of the White Host, who have been content with the status quo for the last thousand years, have been preparing for the prophesized Last War of Revelations. They are massing their armies, secretly, awaiting the signs that would reveal the Beast, called the Whore of Babylon. But she had another name once, one that brought fear to all who heard it, and nearly destroyed the civilized world in her time. She was the Aspect of Destruction, Tiamat, imprisoned by the Babylonians five thousand years ago, whose chains were being broken by a supercomputer at MIT.</p>

<p>He woke.<br/><br/>The first thing he noticed was the chill. It was a pervasive thing, it felt as if it froze the very marrow of his bones. Not normally affected by weather, he found the sensation unpleasant, but not unbearable. Standing up, he began to take in his surroundings. There was no light -- no that is not right, there was no normal source of light. No lantern, no torch, no lamp, no light bulb; yet the room gave off a subtle luminescence, centered on where he sat. Driving his vision further past the illumination, he noticed that there was a radius to the field of unlight and the area he was sitting in was larger than he was able to initially perceive. <br/><br/>""Curious."" The sound of his voice, flew free. Encoded with his desire, it fled into the darkness and did not return. The very nature of its failure told him everything he needed to know. This subtle use of his power told him he was not in the world as he knew it. He realized he must be in a nearby Shard or worse, lost in the Void. As he considered this, his apprehension began to take shape.<br/><br/>Almost casually, he inspected himself and found everything seemed to be normal. He was still wearing the grey and black suit and vest common to his attire and the last thing he remembered wearing to work. His shirt was still the silken, Italian blouse he favored for formal meetings. He was wearing his favorite leather shoes, with an added non-slip surface beneath them. Not that he ever feared slipping, but it was a habit from a bygone era when one's footing might cost one's life. And until now, He had been very careful.<br/><br/>He looked down at his hands. They were still the strong hands of a Roman soldier, a bit more weathered, a bit less callused, but still capable of relieving a man of his life with a variety of tools. But the thing he was looking for was gone. His ring was missing. The sigil of his power was missing. This did not mean he was powerless, it meant that for his duty to continue, the ring moved to his successor. That meant he could not leave this prison. And that his power was in the hand of a mortal, for the first time in two millennia. A mortal He truly loved but had poorly prepared for this day.<br/><br/>He could only hope that his impressions all those decades ago were right.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>The Director tried to wake from a dream that seemed overwhelming real and quite visceral. It was not his normal condition to dream, having not done so for many years since coming to work at Death, Incorporated. Having not dreamed in decades, left him open to the strange, surreal nature of this dream. He was standing in the middle of a field surrounded by monstrous creatures of all shapes and sizes, wielding a sword of ice and shield comprised of a field of force laying waste to everything around him. <br/><br/>In the distance, he could see demons and angels flashing swords of flame and lightning, illuminating the battlefield. This seemed to last days and nights and then with a final flash of lighting, the battle ended. He was the only thing standing unscathed on the field. Taking in the horrible vista, he wept, openly. <br/><br/>Time passed.<br/><br/>Sensing moving in the corner of his eye, he turned and dropped his terrible, ice-sword, which froze the very air near it and the blade shattered as it struck the ground. It was an Angel still moving slowly, feebly trying to remove the corpse of some horror draped across it. The Director found himself striding toward the Angel with a strange ambivalence in his core. Grabbing the nearest limb of the giant white gorilla, he flung it from the Angel, who sat up.<br/><br/>""Did we win?"" the Angel croaked, his voice dry and likely burned from angrily flung cocoastrum during the battle. ""I can't see you, please come closer.""<br/><br/>""No, I do not think your side won,"" the Director intoned gravely, ""we are the last things alive here, so I can safely assume, my side did not win either. Do you have a name?""<br/><br/>""I was once called Malik, the Guardian, and I guarded the doors to Hell,"" the Angel glowed visibly upon the recitation of his former station and for a moment seemed more majestic than his current condition, covered in the blood and offal of other creatures would allow.<br/><br/>""You may call me, Aurelius,"" the Director said. ""I think I was once the general of this army but now I am not so sure.""<br/><br/>""Well met, former general of a once mighty army. You must have been formidable to have defeated this mighty Host..."" Malik began. ""I cannot remember why we were fighting, though General. Do you have any memory of the conflict?"" The Director seemed surprised by the Angel's confession and had to think deeply himself.<br/><br/>""To be honest, I have no memory of why or how this battle took place. I am willing to forswear any further conflict if you are Malik, of the Angelic Host,"" the Director's feeling in this regard seemed sincere, even as this very real dream transpired.<br/><br/>""General Aurelius, as much as I appreciate you taking the time to free me from confinement, I am not able to forswear violence toward your person. There is still the matter of the Heavenly Host who even now, tell me to rend thee, limb from limb,"" Malik seemed pained to admit this and sat back on his haunches and spread his wings. While he was sitting, he appeared to slowly get cleaner and his injuries began to shimmer and heal themselves. ""Perhaps we could simply sit a bit longer and see if we can untangle this since there is no one here but you and I. Perhaps we can come to an agreement.""<br/><br/>General Aurelius - the Director took in the scene and for a moment was surprised by the carnage - there seemed to be a variety of warriors from a variety of ages, lost in time and space, vast incredible armies with amazing technologies all lay about the battlefield. The General's senses transcended the five and with his extended awareness could see ripples in time and space where these armies were snatched and conscripted. He could also sense the ruptures that the enemy used to reach this battlefield between Time and Space. Until he used those senses, his awareness was limited to this place, this space, this time, suddenly he was aware of a thousand times, a thousand places, where He reigned and suddenly realized where and who He was.<br/><br/>""Malik, Angel of the Host, I declare this conflict completed. And as an act of Mercy, I shall allow you, the final survivor, to return to your Host. Remind them, this is our final conflict. The next time we meet, I shall destroy you and yours utterly. Know this and never return,"" the pronouncement was clearly delivered and chilled the very air around the both of them. There was a weaving of force, of malice, of murderous intent in those words. The General was sure his words were relayed to the Host, even as he said them.<br/><br/>Malik, clearly shaken by the tone, and the message, stood and suddenly his twelve foot stature, seemed to overshadow the tiny General before him. ""General, looking around the battlefield, it is clear that you and I are at the locus of something terrible, but I do not believe that you are in any position to make demands, or to cast threats. From where I stand, it is you, who should be looking at surrender. I am Malik, the Guardian, the warder to Hell, the hand of God and Sealer of Doors. You are in no position to make demands."" Malik suddenly burst into white flames and a blue flaming sword appeared in each of his hands.<br/><br/>The General looked at the Angel and was momentarily in awe. ""Beautiful."" With a momentary pause, he whispered, ""I'm sorry."" The General raised his hand and suddenly the Angel appeared to be in a fearful wind, his flames flickered and were blown backward, wisps blasted back as the wind increased. Malik roared and leapt forward, blades flashing forward, blue fire glowing like the sun. The General Aurelius, the Director, watched in horror as his outstretched fist clenched and some unknown force exploded forward and simply erased the Angel Malik, Guardian and Warder to Hell, Hand of God and Sealer of Doors, from existence.<br/><br/>The Director screamed, a long wail that caused fear in all who heard it, and then he woke, his right hand burning. On his hand was the ring from his dream, bearing the Aspect Skull of Death backed with a nuclear plume, the symbol of the destroyer of Worlds.</p>

<p>I'm not worried about fitting in here. I don’t fit into my jeans; why should I fit into high school?</p>
<p>Pushing my way through second period passing, I’m a salmon swimming upstream. Make that a whale—one-hundred sixty-five pounds of raw sophomore flesh waddling through the halls of Armario High.</p>
<p>After transferring here less than three weeks ago, I’m about as popular as a stale donut at a wedding reception. Not that I’m worried. I’ll make friends once I join a club or something. Just need to find ‘my people.’ That’s what my mom says.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Two girls standing at my locker wave me over.</p>
<p>“Hi.” I tug at my jeans and smile, settling my stack of books into my hip crease. “I’m Magenta.”</p>
<p>“Great. You’re perfect.”</p>
<p>I blush.</p>
<p>“Look at this.” The smaller girl, a petite brunette, points at her locker. Its door sits ajar.</p>
<p>“Wow, pretty crowded in there,” I state the obvious.</p>
<p>“I know, right?” Her line of sight aims straight at my chest.</p>
<p>I adjust my books. “I don’t stuff my locker. Keep most of my books with me. Passing period’s such a pain.”</p>
<p>She smiles, flashing her recent orthodontic release. I know because she’s wearing a retainer which imprisons a tiny brown something.</p>
<p>I consider telling her but think different after her next comment.</p>
<p>“Yeah, so, um, help me out.” Her tone shifts from high-pitched and perky to downright demanding.</p>
<p><em>What the hay, man.</em></p>
<p>“Go on, put your girth into it,” her tall slender friend sings. <strong>(254)</strong> “A little hip action, and you can shove her locker shut tight.”</p>
<p>The two girls smile. The petite locker owner sets her hands on her hips—or slivers of bone that hold up her jeans. “I don’t want to be late. Come on.”</p>
<p>I stare once more at the over-stuffed locker, glance down at my “girth,” and try to decide if I want to help and make new friends or if I want to tell them to fuck off.</p>
<p><em>Bam!</em></p>
<p>“Nice. Thanks, Madeline!” The two skip off.</p>
<p>“It’s Magenta,” I say, but they’ve disappeared in the sea of students.</p>
<p>I twist the black knob to my own metal box, shove in my math text, and close the door. Like I said, I don’t cram my locker with too much crap.</p>

<p>Set in the 1760s in Northeast America, Alessa has been a traveling apothecary since her parents were executed on charges of witchcraft, and she searches for a master apothecary willing to overlook her status and gender to permit her to apprentice with him. On her journey, she finds herself in a town paralyzed by fear of an unspoken menace from the forests, and no can be trusted to be what they appear. With bands of Native Americans and French fur traders attacking nearby towns and British taxation causing increased tension among the colonies, Alessa must find a way to survive without being caught in the cross-hairs of conflicts, whether socioeconomic, cultural, or supernatural.</p>

<p>While she was trying to think of something noncommittal and evasive in response, Alessa heard a woman shouting from the commandant’s house. A woman in a gray dress with a loosely fastened white bonnet was screaming as she was escorted to the center of town.<br/>“You have to believe me! He was changing! That’s the only reason I did it! I had to!” she shrieked, trying to free herself from the two guards leading her to an ominous charred pole. The commandant and another group of guards followed after the two men, and all the townsfolk within earshot began streaming out of their houses. There were at least forty men, women, and children that Alessa could count. Mr. Churchill locked his house behind him and extended his arm to her, saying, “Shall we go to the execution?”<br/>“But what has she done?” she asked, slipping her hand in the crook of his elbow. It would be extremely poor form to refuse such a gentlemanly gesture.<br/>“A fortnight ago, she was found by her neighbor covered in her husband’s blood. He was the local gunsmith, so Mr. Faolan has had to take on many of his responsibilities. She claimed he was one of the demons in the forest, but he looked perfectly human when the guard investigated the scene.”<br/>He led her over join the crowd and watch the spectacle. Several blocks of tightly bound kindling were placed at the foot of the pole and the woman was forced to stand upon them while her hands were chained behind her. Several of the young boys gleefully added their own bundles of sticks and branches around her, while the commandant looked on. He was a stern man with a white curled wig that reached just above his shoulders. His face was perfectly clean shaven and even his socks were completely free of a single spot of mud. Beside him was a dark-skinned Cherokee woman with braided hair lying in front of her shoulders, who Alessa presumed was his wife.<br/>“Mrs. Brown, you have been accused and convicted of murdering your husband, a fine upstanding member of this community, without motive or provocation. You are sentenced to burn for your crimes. Do you have any last words before Mr. Evans says your last rites?” asked the commandant, watching her crying face dispassionately. <br/>“Please, I have children, I just wanted to protect them! I saw him turn into a monster before my eyes!”<br/>The commandant nodded to Mr. Evans, who flipped open a worn King James Bible and began the prayer. One of the guards, who Alessa recognized as Simon Lewis, carried a torch to the pyre, lighting each of the corners of kindling around Mrs. Brown. Alessa’s hand tightened on Norman’s elbow, feeling sick to her stomach. It was all she could do to keep from retching as she trembled against him. The sound of screams and the smell of smoky, burning human flesh evoked memories of sorrow and fear that she had felt two years ago, on the worst day of her life.</p>

<p>Once mere creations of fantasy and fiction, superheroes lived only on the pages of brightly-colored comic books and in the imaginations of children - at least that was the case before the Last War of Wars broke out like nuclear wildfire across all seven continents, and humanity began to systematically annihilate itself one missile strike at a time. In a last-ditch effort to find peace again, a group of scientists and world leaders initiated a secret military operation to design and create an army of the first Enhanced Life-form Prototypes in Humanoid Engineering, or ELPHEs. With the world on its knees, these genetically-enhanced super soldiers led mankind back to peace and prosperity, and fifty years later, a new generation born with those same extraordinary gifts, will take up that calling. Some will answer willingly, some...really won't.</p><p><br/>Eighteen-year-old Lexa Laney was debating where to spend her summer holiday after graduating from the Northeast Academy of Higher Learning when she received word that she had been accepted to the Unified Nations Military Core. This was surprising information as Lexa was confident she had not applied. Of average height, average build, and well-below-average ambition, there was no recruit less fit for service than Lexa Laney, and she was sure that twelve weeks and a new wardrobe weren't likely to change that fact. Nevertheless, it is as they say: when destiny calls, just try and play dead until it goes away.</p>

<p>Have you ever experienced those precognitive feelings?  Just knowing something terrible or amazing is going to happen shortly can shape the way you live.  After all, if you knew you where going to die, wouldn’t you live your life differently?  Well, for Clarissa she grew up experiencing these feelings more often than most.  As she got older, those feelings came more often and they always came true.  Then one day, she saw the strings for the first time.  She saw a faint line from her boyfriend John at the time, and saw how it just drifted out of his chest and followed him everywhere he went.  Later she saw how they knotted together with others strings showing how connected those people where to each other.  As this became stronger she started to experience other things as well.  She started to see how sometimes the strings seemed to fight back on their own while other times they just sat there and followed like loose hair.  <br/><br/>Then one day she had a dream.  She had a dream she was in the Forrest of Knots and could travel along the stings.  There was no time constraints, no feelings, just connections.  She caused the ripple that was noticed by the Somnio group that held charge of the Knott.  They controlled all such beings and they noticed she was strong.  They started their search for her and she continued to grow stronger.  <br/><br/>When they finally caught up to her, she was well in her 20’s and had experienced the Forest of Knotts more than she wanted.  She’s going to have to come to terms with her abilities and her roll on earth, or she’s going to die.  The Somnio doesn’t accept flounders and those who go against the grain.  They are the illuminate of the dreamscape and in turn, the world.  They don’t play nicely with others in their playground.</p>

258,Grant Faulkner,Novel: The Debaters,Genre: Young Adult,50114,"1,670",1,"
<p>This is the first novel I've written that has a direct connection with my life. I don't know its exact plot line yet (I'll discover that in the writing, I hope), but the story will revolve around a rollicking, rogue debate team I was on when I was in high school. We were essentially the Bad News Bears of the Iowa debate circuit. We were all nerdy outcasts and punk rockers who took pride in winning any argument with our bravura rhetorical flourishes (and we liked to instigate them). Each weekend we traversed the state, led by a delinquent and debauched debate coach. And then there was teen romance, of course. Or teen yearning. And plenty of references to Nietzsche.   </p>

260,Grant Faulkner,Novel: The Letters,Genre: Literary Fiction,51283,"1,709",1,"
<p>""The Letters"" is about one of my favorite fictional subjects: tragic, forlorn lovers. I've always wanted to write an epistolary novel, so this is my first attempt at one. The catch is that it's a one-sided epistolary novel--it flows from letters written, but never sent. The protagonist intends to send them, but somehow he simply knows it's wrong (for a variety of reasons), or just can't. <br/><br/>He writes as if to a muse, to a true confessor, and his letters become a reflection on his life and the existential dilemmas he finds himself trapped in (a la Camus's ""The Fall""). The more he writes, though, the more the reader must question his reliability as a narrator. Is he a true lover, obsessed, a mad man, or all three? Has he mythologized and rehashed his memories to the point that their reality is questionable? And then there's the question of whether he'll send the letters, what will happen if he does, or if the letters will be discovered by another?<br/><br/>It's a heady task, but I'd like this novel to trace the themes of Roland Barthes' ""A Lover's Discourse."" We'll see....</p>

It's not so easy to find Steinberg, or travel across states to get to his home.

<p> CHAPTER ONE            March 5, 1922<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jordayne clutched the scrap of paper in her hand tightly, while navigating around a mud slush pile of icy snow.   Here in Chicago, winter was fighting tooth and nail against the encroaching spring, the cold days still out numbering the warm.<br/><br/>This was not part of the city that she ever came to.  Along the dark narrow alleyways, old tenement buildings leaned towards one another.  The adjoining walls sagging together, old and forgotten from their glory days.  Now simply trying to stand with the help of their neighbors.  <br/><br/>Only a few of the windows had lights on, dimly yellow behind tacked up ragged fabric.  The far spaced streetlights spread dim illumination in small spots over the ice coated sidewalk.<br/><br/>The wind coming off the lake at this time of night was bitter.  She snugged her wool scarf a bit tighter, and tried to make out the numbers on the buildings.   <br/><br/>She’d missed the address, and began to backtrack.   Waiting once on a shadowed stoop until a group of men passed by.   The only people she’d seen since coming into this poor section.<br/><br/>It took three tries before she found the address scratched roughly into an iron post.  It stood near a flight of icy steps leading down to a basement apartment.  She went down carefully, one hand on the weathered wall for balance. <br/><br/>The building was old as all the others on this block, but the door new.  Strong and thick oak,  with heavy steel hinges, and no doorknob on the outside.    She banged on it three times, putting some strength behind each knock.  After a few moments a tiny slide in the door moved aside. From behind it,  a man looked her up and down.  All she could see of him was his blood-shot eyes.<br/><br/>Jordan fumbled with the slip of paper, almost lost it to the wind, and then by the faint light from the opening held it up.  <br/><br/>“Babe Ruth” she said.<br/><br/>The man behind the door flicked his glance to the paper, and made a grunt of disapproval.  The peephole slid closed. There was a rattle of chains and locks being undone, and the door swung open.<br/><br/>She stepped into a tiny room, as the door swung shut.  It just big enough to hold a tall wooden stool, herself, and the huge man, more fat than muscle, who methodically refastened all of the hardware. Overhead, the electric bulb hanging from a wire put out a feeble glow.   Another  narrow set of stairs went further downward into dimness.  The space felt close, humid and smelled of old sweat and garlic. <br/><br/>Breath coming in short, wheezing puffs, he hauled himself onto the stool.  His bulk sagging comically over the edges.   Then reached up and pressed a small button set in the doorframe. From somewhere far below she heard a faint buzz.  Without a word, he jerked a thumb towards the narrow stairs leading below.   His attention refocused on the door with its chains and padlocks, she might as well have been invisible.<br/><br/>The steps creaked under foot as she went down.  There was another door at the bottom, this one as old as the building.  Scuffed and splintered at the bottom, paint showing in faint streaks of yellow, white and green.  She hesitated a moment in front of it, feeling her heart pound, trying to screw up her courage.  <br/><br/>You can do this.  It isn’t theft and it isn’t illegal.  <br/><br/>She drew in a breath, pushed her shoulders back, and twisted the knob to go in.<br/><br/>The Speakeasy was nothing like those in the motion pictures.  There were no fringe-dressed flappers dancing on tables.  No walls covered in white satin.  No loud jazz band, or mirrors. No handsome young men in tail coats and white ties. <br/><br/>It was a dingy basement room, lit meagerly by more bulbs hanging from wires.  The floor was packed dirt, and the bar a broad piece of wood over two barrels.   The only thing that matched her expectation was that there were tables and chairs.  Scarred, chipped and broken bits of furniture, hardly capable of holding the rough dressed men that sat at them.    Their shoulders were hunched protectively.  Gnarled, work stressed hands wrapped around short, dirty glasses filled with dark liquor.  <br/><br/>She pulled the door closed behind her as quietly as she could.  None of them looked up or over at her.  Not even the beefy man behind the bar in a soiled apron.  He was counting bottles in one of the crates.  <br/><br/>It was hot in here, and filled with the haze of cigarette and cigar smoke.  Jordayne scanned the crowded room, trying to find the person she’d come to meet.  The note had been vague, just a password, this address, a date and a time.<br/><br/>There was a slight movement at a shadowed far table that caught her eye.  A brief glimpse of a gray fedora and a dark brown coat, out of place against the others here.   She squeezed around the room’s edge in that direction.  <br/><br/>The man at the table looked up at her in mild interest.  There was a half-filled bottle on the table, and two glasses.  One of which was mostly filled in front of him, the other empty. The table top was marred by layer upon layer of initials and crude pictures scratched into the top.<br/><br/>She took off her gloves and stuffed them in a pocket, unwound her scarf and unbuttoned the top of her coat against the warmth of the room.  She knew she looked a mess, windblown and with her face reddened by the cold. <br/><br/>He sat very still, watching her intently, until she was done fumbling with her things. <br/><br/>“Drink?” he asked, with a lazy gesture towards the bottle. <br/><br/>“Yes . . . I mean . . . no . .  I mean no thank you.”  <br/>She was nervous and flustered, out of her depth in these surroundings.   The steady gaze of his warm brown eyes did not put her any more at ease.  <br/><br/>“Pity.”<br/><br/> He tipped the glass up to swallow the liquor in one elegant movement. <br/><br/>An uncomfortable silence fell between them.  Jordayne looked at him, at the table, around at the other patrons, then back at him.  He was tallish, and broad chested — even though he slouched in the chair.  His hair was light, perhaps pale brown or blonde, the hat hid most of it.   His face attractive, with sharp planes and angles.<br/><br/>He set the glass back on the table slowly and very carefully.  In that instance she knew that he was just this side of drunk.<br/><br/>“You’re the girl then?  The girl who can get into the library?”.<br/><br/>It was more a statement than a question, and she head some faint, unplaceable accent in the words.  <br/><br/>“Look.  I know I came,  but I think this is a mistake.”  <br/><br/>He reached inside his coat, and slid a fifty dollar bill across the table toward her. <br/><br/>Jordayne caught her breath.  It was a lot of money.  Money she desperately needed. She  took a step closer, reached out for it, hesitated and then drew back her hand. <br/><br/>His gaze pinned her,    “Sit.  We’ll talk.  Maybe you’ll change your mind.”   He tap . . . tap . . . tapped the bill with a finger tip. <br/><br/>She hesitated a moment longer.  It’s not theft.  It’s not illegal.  You need the money. <br/><br/>Drawing out the chair, she sat across the table from him.  They were pressed up against the wall of the basement, through the wood paneling she could smell damp and mold.  <br/><br/>“Jordayne. .  .  .   Jordayne Pierson.  And yes, I’m a student at the University of Chicago.  So I have access to the library there.” <br/><br/>He leaned forward, all sharp interest now.   “A bit of a late bloomer for school, aren’t you?  You must be what . . .  twenty-three, twenty-four?”<br/><br/>She winced a little, “Twenty-six, not that it matters. I’d like to know who I’m doing business with.”<br/><br/> He brought out from another pocket, a much battered business card, handed it over to her. She glanced at it quickly, and then back to him.  <br/><br/>“Adam  A. Adamson?  Real Estate?”  <br/><br/>There was nothing about this man that would let her believe he was a real estate agent.<br/><br/>He leaned back, steepleing his fingers together to regard her with bemusement.  “The middle A is silent.”<br/><br/>She simply gaped at him, unable to form a response before he spoke again. <br/><br/> “This is not complicated.  The agreement is the book for cash.  Part now, the rest when you deliver.”<br/><br/>“And you’ll have it back to me before two weeks?”<br/><br/>A nod in answer.  “In the exact same condition that you give it to me.”<br/><br/>Jordayne tried to see the flaw.  The place where it would all go wrong and land her in trouble.  Maybe even jail.  The book wasn’t even valuable, it was in the stacks.   Anyone who was a student had access to it.<br/><br/>“All right.”  <br/><br/>She put fingertips on the bill, and slid it across the table, sealing a deal with the devil. Folding it up very small, she thrust it deep in the pocket of her coat.<br/><br/>“See that address on the bottom of my card?”<br/><br/>Jordayne looked at it again.  There was some darkish smudge on the edge.<br/><br/>“Thirty-eight State Street.  Number 301.”<br/><br/>“Bring the book there tomorrow, that’s my office.  After you get out of class, that would be around 4 pm?” <br/><br/>She opened her mouth to ask him how he knew her schedule, and then thought better of it.  Shut her mouth, and drew in a deep breath instead. <br/><br/>Jordan stood and rebutttoned her coat, snugged her scarf around her throat again.  “I’ll be there.” <br/><br/>“One more thing.” he added, just as she was about to step away.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“I need that business card back.  It’s the only one I have.”<br/><br/><br/> </p>

<p>Chapter One <br/><br/>It was the sharp stabbing pain at the top of his spine that made Jaith opened his eyes.  He took in a shallow breath trying not to move, blinking slowly once or twice.  The rough wood grain of the table dug into his cheek. <br/><br/>He’d fallen asleep.  Again. <br/><br/>He levered himself up stiffly, trying not to turn his head too much until the muscles relaxed.  His mouth was dry, eyes gritty.  One hand had gone numb where it tucked under him when he dozed off.  He stretched a little, rolling his shoulders gingerly, trying to work out the stiffness a bit at a time.<br/><br/>The late afternoon sun was slanting through the windows, dust motes dancing in the golden haze.  Sounds filtered in on the cool sea air.  Children playing in the street, the rattle of a passing cart over the cobblestones, a door pulled shut.  <br/><br/>Jaith shook his hand a couple of times feeling the prickle of circulation returning.  His shop front room was empty – as usual.  The only comfort in that was that no potential client had come in to find him asleep on his scribe’s desk.  That comfort would not put food in his belly, or pay the rent, which was near to come due.  <br/><br/>Even in this less than desirable part of the city, a large open space with three small cramped rooms behind for living – was an expense that he struggled to meet.  In this less than desirable part of the city, there was little call for a newly minted master scribe.  It was a vicious circle – to find work one needed to be in the center of things where.  Near the sea traders’ counting houses, the churches, or the luxury market where nobility would want fine books or letters written to far away places.  But to be in those places cost much more than he could manage.   <br/><br/>He’s struck out on his own, choosing independence over going into a position as a lowly clerk – writing dull invoices and hoping for an advancement that might never come.  It has been a simple plan, a year ago when he was fresh out of his master’s apprentice contract.  Work for a year, save his money, and move progressively upwards – until his fine hand and elegant designs were the envy of his betters.  <br/><br/>Only it hadn’t quite worked that way.  Jaith hadn’t counted on only writing an occasional receipt for the sale of chickens, or a set of labels for homemade cheeses as the showcase for his talents.  The steady stream of wealthy patrons had not materialized.  Their absence left him often choosing between keeping a roof over his head, or a loaf of two day old bread washed down by water from the communal fountain.<br/></p>

297,laceywilson,Novel: Barefoot & All Gussied Up:Confessions of a Small Town Hom...,Genre: Personal,761,25,0,"
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Growing up in a small town has its struggles, but it also has its perks. I was born and raised in the same town as both my parents, and my grandparents were either born there as well or within a 30 mile radius. I seriously have memories walking into the grocery store and not getting to the checkout counter for an hour. Why you ask? Not because it was overcrowded but because people like to talk. Small town people love to talk! Every time we went somewhere, we knew someone. No lie. Needless to say, everyone knowing your business got old for me, especially as a teenager. But the sweetness of growing up in such a place never goes away. From the genuine handwave you receive from the people driving by the house on their way home in the country, to the smell of the loblolly pines that stood in the State Park before the 2011 wildfire wiped them out, the town of Bastrop, Texas matters more to me now more than it ever has before.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There were times I felt like a fish out of water, not just being in the town but even in my own family. I loved school and learning and was apparently better at gaining white friends than anything else. Being little Lacey was difficult. I was sensitive to negative things, and always wanted peace. That proved difficult, especially at home where chaos would erupt during what was supposed to be Sunday dinner at Granny's house. School was my escape. My teachers were my role models, and I fought hard to not be a small-town-black-girl-who-thinks-she's-better-than-everyone-else-and-talks-white. At times, I felt like I lived a double life, and it was terrifying. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I learned a lot in my hometown. As a teenager, I played volleyball from the age of 12 until I graduated from Bastrop High School and threw myself into the world of being a teen in a small town. I must say, it is something everyone should experience at 16. When you are used to dirt roads and one, maybe two stop lights on the main highway through the town, you must get creative with how you spend your time. So that's what we did. In middle school (because it's wasn't called ""junior high"" in Bastrop), if I wasn't at volleyball practice or a game, I was walking the neighborhood with friends. One of my best friends, Heather, who you will hear more about later, lived about a 10-15 minute walk from me, and we would meet halfway and decide whose house to camp out at for the evening. My cousins, extended cousins, and cousins who were really cousins but you grew up with them like they were cousins would come over every single day during the summers to hang out. Our house was always where people ended up. My mom loved it! It was a much needed change for me and my siblings after living in the country. By the time high school rolled around, I was beginning to figure some things out about myself. I had started to go to church pretty regularly by the age of 12 (as a kid we mostly went on Easter and Christmas and occasionally we would attend a family member's funeral), so as a teenager, I was considered a bonafide Jesus Freak. Yes, yes that's right. Ok, well, maybe not bonafide (yet), but attending church and attempting to read the King James Bible was a serious priority. Don't judge! I continued to play and excel at volleyball, joined Student Council, played clarinet in Wind Ensemble (only freshman year). Being in a relationship wasn't really at the forefront of my mind, for many reasons, one being I knew I was gay and there was no way in hell I was going to come out of the closet. Instead I focused on my grades, sports, and friendships. I met my very best friend, Dallas Stobaugh (now Armstrong) my sophomore year! Thinking about this now makes me sound like I was a level-headed kid with no concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That's a bold-face lie! </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Senior year. The  Jesus lovin', all's good in my world, intelligent, out-going, loving black girl fell apart. I lost it. At school. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I skipped class the entire day. I couldn't get together. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It wasn't until I was 27 that I started to put together the pieces of me that were broken. 10 years later, I figured it out. That small town of Bastrop, Texas almost got the best of me. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Almost. And for that, I am grateful. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With the exception of my brief stint at dorm life, every tear, every joy, every sorrowful and celebratory moment I had happened there until August 2015. My wife and I packed up our car and moved to California. Bastrop is the only place I know. From the religion and politics that built me up then shattered me to my grandmother's homes that are an essential part of my childhood and also the cemetery where they were both laid to rest, the streets I roamed with my siblings and friends, and the school walls that kept me safe but also gave off this superficial aroma, reminding me constantly that I truly didn't know who I was, to the pine trees. Oh, the pines. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bastrop is home. It will always be home. All the people mentioned here are a true part of me, good, bad, and darn ugly. I wouldn't have these stories to share without them. I wouldn't be who I am today without them. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Peas + Fire</span></p>
<p>Senior year of high school was probably the most entertaining for me. I wasn’t the girl who sought out the crazy parties and couldn’t wait to partake in underage drinking. I preferred “innocent”  fun. To us country kids, that meant taking the backroads and stealing street signs. That also meant hanging out at the Jack Shack trying to figure out how we can spend our Friday and/or Saturday night. The Jack Shack was my friend Jack’s little studio he had on his parent’s property. It was basically a way for them to separate our rambunctious group of teenagers so they could have peace and quiet.</p>
<p><br/><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you walk into the Jack Shack, there was about 400 sq ft. of space, and the atmosphere reeked of teenage boy, not in a dirty socks and underwear kind of way. There was a mini fridge with random drinks in it and on the large wall were two posters of half-dressed women in cropped football jerseys. The video game system was hooked up to a large television we hardly ever used unless a scary movie was on the agenda for the night. There was a faded sofa that did the trick for seating and a few kitchen chairs just in case non-crew members decided to come and be cool with us for a night. It was a safe place for our crew to get together and just be...until peas and fire happened. Yep. Peas and fire. </span></p>

With all of this, she still couldn’t point out what was missing in her life. Until one night, a man appears with information about her missing parents, and sends her on a journey that changes her life forever. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sitting alone at the park or at the coffee shop around the corner from her apartment she realized too soon that she’d forgotten how to live in the world around her. People in this new city were always moving. It seemed that they always had plans, had a place to go, had other people to meet and see and hug and laugh and cry with already. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sometimes she would bring Tequila and cigarettes onto her roof and look at the scope of this city and think about what everyone was doing. Sometimes she saw her neighbor across the street changing clothes, usually in a hurry, and most of the time the blonde haired woman would change her top several times and each time look in the mirror sideways before changing again or running around looking for things to put in her bag before leaving. Several moments later the blonde haired woman would emerge at the bottom of the building, lock her door, and walk down the same street until she could not be seen anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Or she would see another neighbor who was always home for some reason--and with the tv on, though, frustratingly, Rhiannon was not once able to distinguish a specific movie or show--and every Monday night had a dinner party with several bottles of wine. The guests sat  around the table eating and drink and laughing for many hours. Usually around midnight her friends would start to leave except one, an older sturdy built gray haired man. Most of the time they would end up in the front room finishing off the wine in bathrobes and most of the time Rhiannon would see the woman, who had a very nice figure, naked, and dancing around the man. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And sometimes she would hear music from a party downstairs and hear friends singing along so loudly she could feel the vibrations of the music. Sometimes she would fantasize about knocking on their door and pretending to be mad about the noise. What she really wanted was them to invite her in to sing and dance and be happy to the loud music. Rhiannon knew this would never happen, she would not impose on their fun. Instead she listened and wondered why being with new people was so hard for her now.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And sometimes she would think about the scope of the world on her finite space of the roof. She would think about how much she doesn’t know or hasn’t experienced. Several times she woke up to news of fighting or shootings or war and she would wonder what cause people had to fight. Were they fighting because of greed or because they were restless. She thought about how people in this time are restless. She thought about how there’s nothing and everything to fear. When there is a war, when you are in a war zone, when you have to fear for your life, it changes your perspective of the world. When you are safe. When there is nothing, really, to fear except the faint and seemingly ellusive posibility of death one day, it makes you uncomfortable. You don’t know what you’re living for. Don’t know how to feel, when people before you have known suffering which made their joy real. You’ve never known anything that is real and true. Even when your parents died it wasn’t real, she thought. The days that we live, I think people destruct to make themselves feel. They don’t know what to do. They don’t know where to go. With all this freedom, with all these choices, it makes people uncertain of what they want to do. What they should do. Their lost. I’m lost. God. We’re all lost, she thought. </span></p>

<p>""Don't waste the taser!"" said Steve. ""We need the shot!""</p><p>Dan looked around. ""What, then? It'll kill him!""</p><p>Steve said, ""I got it!"" He ran to the closet next to the coach's office, and grabbed a bat. Running at the alien, he got there just as the sheriff's taser went off.</p><p>""Argh!"" the sheriff was yelling in pain as the electricity pulled an agonized yell from him. It also elicited a loud screech from the alien.</p><p>""Die, you ugly!"" Steve yelled as he brought the bat down with all his might on the top of the alien's head. He hit it right next to an eye. The alien shuddered, and dropped the sheriff. It began to turn around. Its tentacles were still shaking.</p><p>""Oh, crap!"" yelled Steve, dropping the bat and running towards the back of the room.</p><p>""You dropped the bat!"" yelled Dan.</p><p>""I know!"" Steve yelled back.</p><p>Dan said, ""Why do you keep dropping things?"" </p>

Well, sit down.” She pulled up a chair for him, gesturing towards it. Daniel held an envelope. He pulled out a wad of papers, handing the top one to Natalie.

<p>The Quest for an heir, no matter the cost by the young king of a desert empire.</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/nytshaed/novels/gods-and-sand/stats,November 2015,"
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I’m going to rule this one day. ALL of this.” Came the male voice from behind her, and off to her right. She knew the voice of her cousin, the Prince and Heir designate for the throne of the desert empire.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Hmmm…” was all the response she could muster as she leaned on the carved stone balustrade looking down at the procession of people coming and going from the Palace. It had been a wedding that day, the king, her Uncle had taken a new wife, and relations from all over the kingdom had been summoned to the celebration. Personally, she didn’t see the need for all of the fuss. He was old, somewhere in his forty years and his bride was not even out of her teens.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“It doesn’t matter what she whelps for him, I’m first in line.” He said with an icy tone to his voice, “you should listen when your future King addresses you!” he said sharply as he grabbed her by the arm, pulled her back away from the railing and spun her around to face him.  “You are my favorite cousin, but you try my patience.” He said, his dark brown eyes bearing down at her. Black lashes, and kohl rimmed his eyes, complementing his dark complexion and hair. He was from the southern part of the empire, where the people were darker in skin tone, and moods as far as she had seen. She was from the North, and was considerably lighter in complexion. Her hair was light brown and her eyes a hazy blend of green and gold.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“You’re hurting me!” she said from a frown and stared back up at him, unafraid. He was older than her by five years, and had a much more chiseled outlook on the world than she did, that was to be expected. He was being groomed for the throne, and ruling a vast empire, and she had little more to learn than reading, writing, and domestic skills.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I can hurt you worse and no one would care.” He said angrily as he continued to glare at her. “I have people executed for less insult than you give to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I’m sorry…” she said as the rims of her eyes began to well up. “I don’t want to make you mad. You always seem mad… lately.” She said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">His gaze remained angry, and lingered on her for a moment longer before he released her arm, and turned away from her in a flurry of dark blue and gold robes.  “Stupid people make me angry.” He fumed further and strode over to where a trio of slaves stood near the doors to the chamber, awaiting his desires.  “Wine!” he barked and before he had reached where they stood, a golden goblet had been filled from a clay pitcher, and presented to him from a bowed slave. Nebaankhtun took the goblet and drank a long series of swallows from it before he held it out to be refilled without the need to ask.  He watched his cousin as she rubbed her arm, and moved away from the open balcony and to a reclining couch inside, in the shade. “You’re weak. The heat should not bother you. You are of Royal blood. We are people of the desert, of the sun, and the heat.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ygret rolled her eyes and sighed at the declaration made by him.  He narrowed his gaze at her, but didn’t say anything. Instead he slowly, and calmly walked over to her and sat down on the edge of the couch. “Drink, you’ll feel better.” He said flatly, offering her his goblet.  She knew better than to refuse, and after she took the cup from him, slowly lifted it up to her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Is it sweet wine, or sour?” She asked timidly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nebaankhtun snorted in derision, “It’s blood you little fool, the blood of my slain enemies.” He said with as much haughty attitude as he could summon. Ygret managed to not burst out laughing, and to aid in not doing that, she sipped from the wine until the earthy taste of the wine filled her mouth. She drank down two swallows, then offered him the goblet back.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Keep it. Finish it. You’ll be the more agreeable to be around if you do.” He said and crossed one leg over the other. Seeing he was for the moment reclining next to his cousin, two slaves with wide fans made of palm leaves moved closer to gently fan the pair. Ygret drank more of the wine, finding it not too terrible. It would have to be the best that was made to be served to the royal family. She supposed the sweeter wine from up North was not considered as good. As she drank the wine, she pondered his comment about it making her more agreeable. She didn’t think she was non-agreeable at all. She knew for a fact from the amount of friends she had back home, she was considered quite friendly, and polite.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before she realized it, the goblet was empty, and she looked around, not sure what to do with it at that point.  An observant slave noticed the motion and immediately approached with pitcher in hand. She refilled the goblet and quickly stepped back away. Ygret opened her mouth to protest the refilling of the goblet, but it was already done.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Here cousin, your turn to become more agreeable.” She said with a smirk as she held the goblet up in front of his face.</span></p>

<p>The deaths of two fathers, one a peer of the realm and the other a scientist on the brink of a great discovery, spurs their daughters Kaiya and Rowena and their friend Squints to form an unlikely alliance in order to complete what their fathers began. The three girls find themselves entangled in a sprawling web of intrigue that reaches far higher into the Albion aristocracy than any of them anticipated as they fight the Queen's Men, enlist the aid of brigands and scourges, get involved with secret societies and generally get themselves trapped in various kerfuffles. Through all of their trials and tribulations, they have only one goal, to build the most advanced airship ever envisioned by the Royal Society and its collective genius, the one thing that would avenge their fathers' deaths, the Welkinbane.</p>

<p>THE lights finally burned out in the study on the second floor. Kaiya crouched low in the shrubbery next to the Fairchild’s fence, waiting to make sure everyone in the house was asleep. The lights in the study had burned valiantly on for hours after all of the rest had been snuffed out. She could only deduce that either the lights had been left lit accidentally or the girl who had occupied the window seat earlier was still there, presumably asleep.</p><p>The cry of a night bird reached her ears and she glanced quickly at where Squints was perched high up in the Rowan tree nearby. Squints had been her friend for many years, and she knew of no lookout as reliable or as prone to gravity. Nonetheless, despite Squints’ many encounters with the hard ground, she still continued to climb tall structures with single-minded determination. Squints signaled that all was clear and Kaiya began to slowly make her way through the garden herbs to where some tenacious ivy had dared creep up the side of the house to the third floor.</p><p>Finding hand and footholds in the ivy was easier than picking locks, so it wasn’t long before Kaiya was scaling the wall like a mountain goat. This really was going to be far too easy. She hated to break into the Fairchild home, it was not something her father would have condoned, but it was essential that she find what she needed. After all, countless lives were at stake. Including her own.</p><p>Kaiya reached the window to Lord Fairchild’s study with no mishaps and she wedged her arm under a very large twist of ivy before pulling the small knife from her belt. She reached up quietly and slid the knife between the two panes, up under the delicate latch that kept them closed. It was a small matter to silently unlock the window and ease the panes outward. In a deft move that could have been the pride and joy of a circus performer, Kaya vaulted herself out of the ivy and up onto the windowsill with the barest noise.</p><p>The moon had peeked out from behind the clouds as Kaiya had climbed, and normally she would have waited until the moon was obscured by clouds once more before attempting to enter, but she was pressed for time and necessity spurred her to be brash. So there she sat, perched in a crouch on the windowsill, her form silhouetted by the light of the moon, blind to whatever was awaiting her inside.</p><p>Kaiya took a deep, slow breath before she stepped down onto the window seat. She noticed right away that something was amiss because what she’d set her foot down on was not the even softness of cushions but instead was lumpy, yet squishy, and let out a painful wail. Startled mid-motion, Kaiya lost her balance and tumbled to the ground in a heap, followed shortly after by whoever had been occupying the window seat masquerading as cushions.</p><p>She let out a pained grunt as she had banged her shoulder against the leg of Lord Fairchild’s monstrous mahogany desk, and tried to scoot her way back from the form that was trying to thrash its way out of the quilt. Kaiya watched in silence for she couldn’t yet force her muscles to move. With a gasp that signaled the quilt’s victim was finally free, a head with a mass of tangled brown hair emerged to glare blearily about. Ice grey, red-rimmed eyes locked onto Kaiya’s startled blue-green ones. First anger, then recognition and finally suspicion flashed in those grey eyes as the girl’s pretty face folded itself into a frown.</p><p>Kaiya had, indeed, been far too brash in her attempt to reach the study as the girl who lay tangled in a quilt across from her was none other than Lady Rowena Fairchild, Daughter of Lord Archibauld Fairchild, Earl of Ethensby. The girl who’d spotted her at the funeral and the one person she’d wished to avoid most.</p>

349,QuinnWhittaker,Novel: Thistletorn,Genre: Horror & Supernatural,17983,599,0,"
<p>Thistle, Alder and Charlie have made it to the Order of Merva with the aid of the notorious Black Shuck. Prepared to fight Mr. Carroll and heal Alice Liddell, the prophecied savior of Otherland and the human realm, Thistle is completely unprepared for what battles await her at the Order. Despised by most for what she is, Thistle must fend off attacks from people in the Order, train her magic, make allies and friends and come into her own. All without the help of Alder, who has been effectively ripped away from Thistle's side by his mother and leader of the Order. Thistle has a lot to prove to the people of the Order before she is initiated and can rush to save Alice. Time is running out for Alice and Thistle will have to stay true to herself and learn to discern friend from foe before it's too late.</p>

<p>Alder stiffly moved towards the door. His witch form going out in a defeated whoosh. He didn’t look back. I didn’t blame him. I had no idea what his expression might have been, but it must have been something because Thomas gazed at him with pity. He passed Thomas and I watched numbly as he turned and strode away down the hall and an overwhelming sense of emptiness overcame me.<br/><br/>I had no idea how long I was going to be here. Granted I had to go save Alice, but I could theoretically be here for years before they decided what they wanted to do with me. And as Lorie had shown me, there was a good chance they might just put me down like an unwanted animal. I had no idea when I would see Alder again.<br/><br/>My protector was gone. The man that I’d come to trust without hesitation, the man I’d come to rely on and love was effectively cut out of my life. My heart ached and came near to breaking but I wouldn’t let it. I turned my head and looked Lorie Barclay, the head of the Order of Menrva, in the eye. I wouldn’t give her the satisfaction of breaking in front of her. She gazed steadily back at me.<br/><br/>It was in that moment that I decided a few things. <br/><br/>I would train and learn whatever I could from the Order about magic in general and do my best to master my own magic as quickly as possible. I would save Alice Liddell so she could save Otherland and the human realm. I would discover what Mordecai wanted with me, what Xeni’s double geis entailed and why Lorie hated Haegtesses with a bitter passion. I would clear myself and my predecessor of suspicion of the murder of the last White King and do my best to bring Mr. Carroll down. I would do as Alder asked and meet the rest of the Order on the very dubious off chance I would find someone else. And, most of all, I would not let Lorie keep Alder from me forever. I would rip the place asunder before I let her keep me from him. <br/><br/>“Get her out of my sight.” Lorie spat. I was beginning to suspect she did that often. “I don’t want to see her before I have to present her to the Order. You deal with her training and initiation, Thomas, since you’re so keen on keeping her here.”<br/><br/>Lorie stormed out of the room then like a frigid willowy fury, her anger palpable as the carpet beneath her feet frosted and crunched. When I no longer could hear Lorie, I released Xeni to let her slip back to the place inside of me where she lived and slowly sank to my knees. The bed behind me stopped creaking and waving and grew still. Charlie whined and licked the side of my face as I stared numbly at the doorway. <br/><br/>A few minutes passed before Thomas’s bare feet with their strange whorling tattoos stepped into my line of sight. Startled, as I hadn’t realized I’d shifted my gaze to stare at the floor, I looked up into his too-symmetrical face.<br/><br/>“What now?” I asked him. The question came out a little more uncertain than I’d intended and I sounded rather lost. Granted I knew what I would and wouldn’t do in regards to the Order now, but I had no idea how to go about it. We stayed like that, Thomas looking down at me and me sitting in a heap on the floor craning my neck back to stare at him, for a while. He seemed to think about that and all of the ramifications of what had transpired and what I was actually asking him.<br/><br/>“Now we get you something to eat.” He finally replied and held a hand out towards me. I gauged this strange man before me as his hand stayed outstretched to me. In the end I figured if Charlie liked him and Alder trusted him more than I’d seen him trust anyone, then he was good in my book. Lifting my hand up to place in his took all of my willpower, but I did it. </p>

<p>Memories of Charlie began flooding me and my heart hurt so bad I’d thought I’d die. Something twisted and broke inside of me somewhere and I suddenly ached with something that felt so alien and yet so familiar. My skin felt tight, like it was too small and my skin tingled all over like I had an electric current running through me. I watched as my tears fell onto Charlie and began to spread. To turn green.<br/><br/>Green.<br/><br/>Confused I sat up over Charlie and watched as what looked like plant vines began snaking from the skin of my palms to Charlie’s left side and soft greenery began to crawl over his fur like moss from where my tears had fallen. I sat there watching for what seemed like forever while the vines turned into branches and sprouted leaves, replacing Charlie’s maimed limbs like some strange plant-based prosthetic.<br/><br/>I rubbed my eyes with one hand just to make sure the loss of Charlie hadn’t induced some sort of hallucination. But from what I could tell, Charlie was being rebuilt right before my eyes. From vines and leaves that were sprouting from my tears and my hands like they were on some juiced up version of Miracle Grow. In a matter of minutes Charlie was, if not fully himself, at least complete in a strange way. I felt something grow in my chest and I opened my mouth, feeling like I was going to burp. A strange light escaped from my lips, bobbed in front of my eyes for a few moments in joy, then flew into where Charlie’s left eye had once been.<br/><br/>Then a miracle happened. Charlie twitched like he did whenever he was having doggy dreams and jerked awake. He lifted his head, turning to look at me, and woofed at my distress. The vines slowed and then stopped spreading from my hands and fell away. I continued to cry, but this time I cried huge tears of relief. I shook with sobs of shock and disbelief. Charlie licked my face, his tongue a strange sensation since now half of it was made out of some sort of soft moss.<br/><br/>I gasped in relief and clutched Charlie to me as if I’d drown and he was my lifesaver. Which he was. I’d cried hard as Charlie had died, but now I cried harder because now he was with me again. I had my only friend back. He struggled up to a sitting position and I stared at what was now Charlie, the shrub edition.<br/><br/>Touching his left ear, I wondered at how it could function as an ear seeing that it was made of twigs and leaves. It twitched and I let out a startled laugh. Charlie wiggled and jumped on top of me, knocking the air from my lungs, and began licking me anew. I let him lick me half to death before sitting up and forcing him back enough to look again. The light that come from my mouth now sat in Charlie’s left eye socket that had been remade into some strange hollow. It looked like a willow-the-wisp and I resisted the urge to touch it.<br/><br/>I realized that we were still sitting in the street so I moved to stand and go back to the sidewalk. Then I remembered the figure. Turning to find out who Charlie had ran full bore for, I heard a rustle and looked just in time to see a barn owl take flight from where the dark figure had stood minutes before. Looking frantically about for someone, anyone in the empty street, I felt a headache coming on when I realized that the person was gone.<br/><br/>Had that figure really just turn into an owl and flown off into the night? It seemed more like something you’d read about in a fairy tale than something you’d see in real life. But then again, if this was only real life Charlie would be dead. The thoughts whirled in my mind, making me light headed as they chased each other round and round until I wondered if I had just imagined the whole thing. Until I looked at Charlie who sat looking at me with his mismatched eyes.<br/><br/>Deciding that I could figure everything else out in the morning and that the most important thing was that Charlie was alive again, I guided him back to the sidewalk. He was kind of unsteady on his new legs but once he realized they functioned just like his old ones, he began jumping about and barking like he was a puppy again. Looking at him once more, I realized that Charlie’s white spots around his muzzle and ears were gone. He was once again sleek and grey and absolutely beautiful, though definitely twiggy.<br/><br/>I really needed to get some sleep, the evening had been way too strange and I somehow felt absolutely drained. As if I hadn’t slept in days. Snagging my bag from the sidewalk, I patted Charlie’s strange new face as we headed off towards home. But halfway down the street, a thought occurred to me.<br/><br/>How was I going to explain Charlie’s new ‘condition’ to the locals? Maybe Miss Tenner had it right along.<br/><br/>Maybe I was a witch.</p>

<p>The Village was a lovely, tranquil, place with thatched roofed cottages and paths that led from one neighbor to another which were kept free of those things no one wants to find on their shoes. Flowers and herbs were in the small gardens attached to the cottages. Chickens and other domestic animals roamed the yards. Small village Children could be seen playing in the dirt while the older ones helped with the animals or helped their parents. It was an idyllic place and the villagers led a charmed existence.</p>
<p>Nothing like this could happen here because bad things rarely did. So when they arrived the people of the village wasn't ready. The normally quiet, friendly town, was thrown into turmoil. Fathers and mothers clung to each other in dismay. The younger village children, who had been spared, cried in confusion and fear. They didn't know what had happened to their once happy world.</p>

<p>In a steampunk alternate history 1871, Captain Michael Spoons is hired to take his crew on a mysterious journey across the Pacific.  But everything is not what it seems, and Spoons is forced to stow away on his own ship to get to the bottom of it.</p>

<p><em>It was 1856 and the pirate ship Arrow had just been captured by the Chinese, leading to the siege of Hong Kong. He had been ordered, along with the other British ships, to defend the island. But when the Chinese launched their rockets at his ship, it was clear that the burning ship was not going to survive. He ordered his crew to abandon ship. Some of them had already perished in the flames so he wasn’t able to account for everyone when the ship started going down.</em></p>
<p><em>It tipped sternward as he made his way through the decks looking for survivors. The more the rear of the ship filled with water, the faster the ship started to sink. He kept himself barely ahead of the water as long as he could before the cold water overtook him. As he held his breath he managed to force open a porthole and squeeze his body through.</em></p>
<p><em>In the turbulent water he couldn’t tell which way was up, so he just swam as far away from the ship as he could to avoid being pulled under with it in its wake. He somehow managed to make it to the surface and find a piece of flotsam to cling to until he was picked up by one of the Chinese ships.</em></p>
<p><em>Though they kept him in the brig throughout the assault on Victoria, they did eventually bring him ashore on the mainland. As far as the British Navy was concerned, however, Captain Spoons had gone down with his ship like so many others in the Second Opium War. Unlike Sir John Bowring and the other British survivors, he was captured by the Chinese Imperial Navy rather than the Army of the Heavenly Kingdom, so he was never transferred to Beijing with the other prisoners. When it became clear that Britain had forsaken him, Spoons earned his freedom by denouncing his allegiance to the British crown.</em></p>
<p><em>He went to work as a merchant. For the first year he struggled, until he befriended an apothecary by the name of Chu Chang. Once associated with Chang, he found it much easier to find customers. Chang taught him the arts of chemical engineering and helped Spoons build up a specialized market trading chemicals among apothecaries.</em></p>
<p><em>When Chang died in 1861 Spoons was able to earn enough money selling his equipment to purchase a ship and hire a crew. Being able to travel by sea opened up possibilities for more profitable trade, and Spoons began expanding his chemical trade business to include the Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương apothecaries in Việt Nam. Spoons noticed a stark contrast between the peaceful healers of the southern Buddhists and the explosive experts of the north.</em></p>
<p><em>When the trans-Pacific telegraph was completed in 1863, Spoons expected the miners of California to want to take advantage of the explosive expertise of the Chinese apothecaries, so he took the Styx across the sea. It was his first time crossing the ocean in a civilian vessel, and many of his Chinese crew were unhappy with how rough the journey was.</em></p>
<p><em>To make matters worse, upon arriving in the Port of San Francisco they found it more difficult than expected to sell their cargo. With the war going on, Chinese apothecaries were reluctant to share any of their explosive expertise with miners in British territory, and most of them had no interest in mining themselves. Spoons managed to find a handful of Chinese miners willing to buy their cargo, but the damage had been done. Most of the crew resigned their positions on the Styx and set out to make their fortunes in the mining industry.</em></p>
<p><em>Spoons gathered a crew, mostly of Civil War deserters, and set out for China once more. They ran a few shipments back and forth between North America and Asia, but when the war ended many of the men wanted to return to their families in the newly formed American Continental Union. Spoons recruited some new crew members and began doing local cargo shipments in the San Francisco Bay.</em></p>

Anwyn’s red-green eyes twinkled as she smiled, “Well since you’re being such a gentleman, maybe I’ll treat you and the crew to a cuppa for excellent speed.” The dimples pushed her round cheeks up in an impish sort of way, and the leaf-like decorations under her eyes seemed to crinkle in a stunning imitation of life.

Across her chest was a bandoleer-like device that, instead of holding ammunition or explosives, held tea tins, ready to be used or offered as samples for potential buyers.

<p>The beginning of <em>The Shuttershock Worlds</em>:</p><p>Brooke always knew something was different in the world. After all, Brooke was a scientist, and solving the world's mysteries is part of the job description for the scientist. Setting up experiments, solving multivariable math equations, thinking of new ideas... it was all part of the scientific lifestyle, one that isn't just a job but a lens with which to view the world.</p><p>Some things, however, take more than some elbow grease and a few million dollars in funding to discover. They take an underground bunker, a thick skin, and... okay, they still take a few million dollars to fund. So when Brooke's working grant expired and she still didn't have a working portal, she began to panic. How could she continue this project?</p><p>That's when she pursued it as a side job to her regular science duties. The good thing about working in a lab is the free time it offers you. Experiments take time to run, people are busy helping out on other experiments, and all this left Brooke with at least an hour a day to work on equations and request materials with no mention of what the materials were being used for. They could all be used just as easily in her current work... you know, the stuff she was getting paid to do.</p><p>No one really believed in Brooke's work. When her coworkers found out, they all said it was a bunch of hogwash that hadn't been proven yet. That was the exact point of science: Nothing could be proven, but it could be tested over and over until it becomes a law like gravity did.</p><p>Still, despite finding Brooke's side work to be ridiculous and not worth funding, they were still curious about how it was going.</p><p>""You discovered any parallel universes yet?"" they would ask. ""Bet you've already gotten the answers to everything in these parallel worlds.""</p><p>And then Brooke would argue that while the worlds were parallel, they weren't parallel in an Euclidean fashion, much how the universe they live in wasn't perfectly flat, or so they believed. Which made this study a particularly enlightening one, a study of other words far beyond our own. Maybe Brooke wouldn't find anything, but you know what? That was okay. The pursuit of knowledge and whatever one would learn along the way was what made this study so fascinating.</p><p>""No one's ever done this before,"" Brooke would say, showing off all the diagrams and items she was building. One diagram showed a portal gun the size of a laboratory telescope, so big that it required an entire room. Brooke hadn't actually built this yet, mostly because she was still working on a portal gun the size of a, well, gun. Something she could carry around easily between universes. The portalscope left the probability of being stuck in one universe way higher than she would like, and that was just unacceptable. What if she couldn't rebuild the portal gun? What if the universe was so different the materials to rebuild the portal gun no longer existed? And she was stuck there forever without a way to come home?</p><p>But she would show them, Brooke would think. She would find these parallel universes that no one willing to fund the research for and show them wrong. Other scientists have come out of nowhere with ideas that worked. Brooke could too, and she would prove her critics wrong no matter what.</p>

<p>The beginning of the robot romance: <br/><br/>Sam's muscles ached as he dug his shovel into the ground and lifted. Why didn't they have machines for this yet, the most arduous part of the mining process? he wondered as a pile of dirt emerged with the shovel. He dumped the dirt in a large container and peered inside it.<br/>A job as boring as this one wouldn't haven't been so bad if digging weren't his only job, he decided while giving the dirt a long hard look. Even the people who oversaw the separation process received some break from the monotony while picking apart the good materials from the cruft. And the truth was, the dirt was mostly just that: dirt.<br/>But Sam kept digging, transferring dirt from the ground to the pile above even though the process was mostly in vain. He felt a pang of pain in his shoudler and set his shovel down for a minute to look at the dirt.<br/>""You ever think about why we're doing this?"" a guy wearing a yellow hard hat asked Sam. Sam wasn't wearing a hard hat; he hadn't earned that privilege yet.<br/>""Every day,"" Sam replied. ""They say we're digging for metals, but do you really think that's the case?""<br/>""Sure,"" the man in the hard hat replied. ""Why wouldn't it be? You see metals everywhere. The buildings we live in, the electronics we use, the robots that live among us. What I'm wondering is why one of those robots couldn't be doing this job instead. Surely they could do a faster job at it than us."" The man in the hard hat planted his shovel in the ground by his side. ""There's gotta be a reason we're doing it instead.""<br/>Sam shrugged. He shouldn't have done that since it made his shoulders hurt. ""Probably so the government can say they're creating jobs,"" he replied. ""You know they love to exaggerate those claims.""<br/>A voice in the distance yelled at them. ""I ain't payin' you to chit chat all day!""<br/>The man in the hard hat sighed. ""Guess we better get back to it,"" he said as they picked up their shovels. ""But I still don't see why we can't get robots to take our jobs. This one was made for them.""<br/>Sam filled in the blanks. ""Boring, repetitive, no intellectual gain to be had, right?""<br/>""I didn't mean it like that,"" the man in the hard hat said. ""I know how you feel about those robots."" He tossed a pile of dirt aside and ignored when it didn't land entirely on the pile it was supposed to land on.<br/>""And we both know,"" Sam said as he planted the shovel in hte ground again, feeling a bigger pain in his upper back, ""that robots are just as valuable as humans. Just as complex. Just as potentially intelligent. Just as likely to incite chaos. They're complex creatures, robots are."" He flung the dirt on the shovel on the pile of dirt, ignoring the pain his body was screaming back.<br/>""I don't know if you can call them complex,"" the man in the hard hat said. ""Your robots will take over the world one day and then where will we humans be?""<br/>Sam stuck the shovel in the ground for another attempt at shoveling. ""Probably just where we were before,"" he replied. ""Surviving against nature and our own creations. Nothing has changed. Nothing will change.""<br/>They fell silent, and Sam continued to shovel on his own for the rest of the day, greeting any attempts at conversation with unpleasant grunts. Shovel in the ground, shovel out. Shovel in, shovel out. He didn't have to like the job, but he could at least do the best job he could without dealing with everyone else.<br/>When the five o'clock bell rang, he grabbed his shovel and walked as fast as his painful body would allow to the shovel return site. Forget waking up and looking forward to getting to work every day, shovel return time was what Sam looked forward to.<br/>A line of men with shovels in their right hands stood in front of Sam, all waiting for the shovel return. The line inched forward too slowly for Sam's comfort, but he had to admit that it was moving along more quickly than when he first started digging holes or whatever it was that he did there. The men with the holes closest to teh front had the advantage, but unfortunately that wasn't a position to be held by juniors like Sam. He woudl have to work long and hard and do something before gaining one of those coveted positions. Maybe find something valuable. He wasn't sure yet, but bribing the higher-ups was probably involved.<br/>Finally Sam could see the front of the line, and a minute later, he was at the front of the line.<br/>A set of closed metal doors stood in front of Sam, along with a glowing wall to the left and a closed box on the floor to the right. Sam stepped up to the door, placed his left hand on the glowing wall, stared at the wall straight ahead, and waited.<br/>""Barker, Samuel L,"" a robotic female voice read. ""All clear for departure. Please drop your--""<br/>""Yeah yeah, I get it,"" Sam said over the voice. The box on the floor opened to just the right size to fit a shovel, and he dropped the shovel inside. The door in front of him opened.<br/>He was free. Free! Free from the prison that was work and free to go home for the evening and do whatever he damn well pleased, which would probably include watching TV and playing games.<br/>Free, that is, until eight o'clock the next morning, when he would show up in line to the field, take his shovel, and do the same thing again for nine hours, all with unpaid breaks.<br/>Sam walked down the street, passing streetlamps, other people making the first shift commute home from work, people making a second shift commute to work, and other people heading to a destination that wasn't work. Billboards, mostly animated ones with news tickers on the bottom, filled the sky space above buildings, and Sam found himself stopping to watch when he got a glimpse of something interesting. Today Sam walked down the street, and as he turned the corner to his house a news ticker read ROBOT HUMANS NOW IN OUR FUTURE, SCIENTISTS PREDICT.<br/>Sam stopped short. Robot humans? What was this beautiful thing this news ticker was saying? <br/>And more importantly, how could he be one?</p>

<p>From An Unauthorized Autobiography:<br/><br/>It really was too bad that I was about to kill her. How much flirting is appropriate with someone you're about to murder, anyway? I feel like there should be a protocol on this, but in all of the family discussions on this matter, no one ever brought up the sensitive topic of killing someone you've flirted with. Still, such a protocol has to exist, and that night I decided to create one.<br/><br/>One, do not, under any circumstances, tell that person you are about to kill them. This should be common sense, but you might be surprised how many people violate this very common sense principle. This is probably because common sense isn't all that common these days. Common cents, however, are extremely common. Telling someone you're flirting with that you're about to kill them not only tells them that you have no long-term commitment plans with them, but it also tells them that you have absolutely no regard for their life. Avoid at all costs.<br/><br/>Two, avoid making death jokes. Come on, this should also be common sense. It's like making death jokes at a funeral. ""It's not going to kill me"" (something I've had the misfortune of making before) can be funny in ordinary circumstances but is inappropriate in places where death is a theme, even for one of you. Even if the other person has no idea what's coming for them, making excessive jokes about death is best avoided. If the other person makes such a joke and you don't know how to react, it's best to react as if you're not about to kill them. However you would react to anyone else making such a joke in normal non-death circumstances would be appropriate.<br/><br/>Third, consider the environment. Are you flirting with them in a graveyard. Big no-no. Same for going on an outing to anything majorly involving death. You don't want it to give too many anvil-sized hints.<br/><br/>Disregard all of the above if you'd like to give anvil-sized hints. Sometimes those can be fun, but other times it can be creepy, especially when the other person says, ""Gee, you really find fascinating, don't you?"" This will probably lead to awkward responses on your end, so it's probably best to take my advice gained from experience and avoid the D-word altogether.<br/><br/>There's probably one other topic you're probably wondering about. What about getting it on? Let's face it, you may want to put off killing someone you have feelings for, and that's completely understandable. That's how I'm feeling at the moment with this case. But if you find yourself wanting to advance your feelings to the physical level, consider how attached you'll feel after killing them. If you think you'll be really attached after their death due to the physical activity, then reconsider this activity for both of your sakes. Do you really want to get physical, snuggle afterward, and then drive a knife into her back? Really?<br/><br/>I didn't think so.<br/><br/>Now let's see if I can take my own advice.</p>

<p>The Shuttershock Worlds (complete, 78787 words):<br/><br/>When you take a photo, you are freezing that instant. Now imagine that when a photo is taken of you, an alternate version of you is created. This alternate version of you continues to live life based on the whims of that instant and continues to grow, live, and learn. This person could turn out to be similar or completely different based on which other alternate people they interact with. An alternate self is free to interact with several other alternates of another person–all separately, of course. There are many, many versions of the same person, the same place, the same thing in the alternate realities.<br/><br/>All this is going on behind the photos. No two alternates of the same person can meet thanks to a special property of the alternate reality. It just wouldn’t be right.<br/><br/>That's shuttershock theory. Now imagine that the alternate realities collide with the real world, the world you and I live in.<br/><br/>An anachronist and kindergarten teacher starts seeing people who appear to be other versions of herself.

<p><br/>From Adventures in Wrimonia:<br/>“I need a plot!” Mia mumbled to herself. “But where am I going to find one?” She nearly ran into a man wearing a pink suit and carrying a magic wand. That wasn’t the first thing she noticed about him, though. She hadn’t been here long, but the first thing she noticed about this man was the lack of name tag.<br/>“Sorry,” he said. “I was just on my way to rush to someone’s side. They needed to know who I am.”<br/>“Who you are?” Mia asked. “How can they tell? You don’t have a name tag.”<br/>“Ah, you must be new,” the man said. Mia took great offense to this as he adjusted the collar on his shirt. “My name is Mr. Ian Woon.”<br/>“Uh, hi, Mr. Woon, I’m Mia,” Mia said, extending her hand for a handshake.<br/>“No, that’s Mr. Ian Woon,” he said, not holding out his hand. Mia let her hand down.<br/>“Okay, fine, good to meet you, Mr. Ian Woon. So who exactly are you? And how’d you get away with not wearing a single name tag in this place? They sneaked a guest name tag on me before I registered.”<br/>“Oh, I’m not doing NaNoWriMo,” he said. “I’m a tradition around here.”<br/>“A tradition?”<br/>“Yes,” Mr. Ian Woon said. “Every year Wrimos everywhere include me in their novel. They can do whatever they want to me. Some use me as a major character. Some use me as a passing name when they need one. Some even kill me.” Mr. Ian Woon took off his jacket and revealed a wound on his sleeve. The blood had crusted over. Mia cringed.<br/>“Have you gotten that cleaned up? I’m sure someone could--”<br/>“No, it’s just fine,” Mr. Ian Woon replied. “I’m still recovering from all the Wrimos who decided to kill me last year. It has to be quick, though, since November’s coming and they may want to kill me again. One person killed me with a rusty titanium spork. A spork. They even made me get tetanus before dying, but they never told me that, no way.”<br/>Mia shook her head. “So do they all meet you before killing you? That’s not very kind.”<br/>“Of course they do. Some are just a little more crass than others.”<br/>“That’s always good to know,” Mia mumbled. She didn’t want Mr. Ian Woon to hear this, but apparently he did anyway, as his ears perked up.<br/>“So if I include you in my novel, what do I get?”<br/>“I get another cameo in someone’s novel. You get another character. It’s win-win.”<br/>“Sure, unless you get killed.” Mia thought back to her own writing. She hadn’t been doing much of it recently, but she had never killed anyone in a work of fiction.<br/>“Well, that’s enough about me. What about you? Do you know how I’ll show up in your novel yet?”<br/>“I don’t even know what I’m writing about yet. I just showed up here today and you expect me to know? Jeepers.”<br/>Mr. Ian Woon shrugged. “It never hurts to ask,” he said. “Besides, some people come in with ideas created years in advance. Crazy, I tell you...” He looked around. “But it’s all okay. As long as you figure out something.”<br/>“Yeah, I hope so,” Mia said. “I have just three weeks.”<br/>“Well, I have to go,” Mr. Ian Woon said. “It was great talking to you, but there’s someone in the All-Ages Coffeehouse who still doesn’t know who I am. As if they couldn’t see the thread that sushimustwrite posted about me in the Reaching 50,000 forum. Silly Wrimos...” Mr. Ian Woon ran off without so much as a goodbye.<br/>“That was rude,” Mia said to herself. She looked around. She was still standing in front of the Realism building. Wrimos, as she now took to calling these crazy people running between buildings, were running around, some entering and exiting buildings, some disappearing to a place she couldn’t quite tell.<br/>How am I going to do this, anyway? Mia asked herself. I haven’t written anything longer than what could fit on a post-it note since my college papers, and suddenly I’m expected to write a book in a month. This is crazy.</p>

<p>    The first time he saw her was two places before him in line at the coffee shop on Third Street, ten in the morning. She was bent over the counter, elbows resting on it and long, dark hair brushing its surface as she spoke to the flustered barista manning the cash register. She laughed, the sound full and unabashed, earning a small, almost uneasy chuckle from the young man as he scribbled her order onto a white coffee cup. It was only when the man behind her, a gruff business-type who had been checking his watch compulsively since he had gotten in line, cleared his throat rather audibly that she straightened herself, blew a kiss to the barista, and moved away to take her place among the others waiting for their drinks. </p><p>    Her steps were more like a glide, carrying her smoothly from one end of the counter to the other. It was only as she moved away that he noticed the strap crossing her body, a faded leather bag resting against her hip bulging almost to the point of bursting. The flap that was meant to keep the bag closed hadn’t been fastened so that each step she took was with a jingle of the metal buckles, adding a kind of music to her movement. When she stopped, she stood tall, dwarfing the other women gathered around not only in physical size but in her presence. Whereas the others kept their heads down, preoccupied with cell phones or newspapers and only looking up when they needed to scuttle out of someone else’s way, she kept her eyes up as if observing her surroundings. </p><p>    He was forced to turn away from her when the young barista turned to him to ask his order. When he turned to take his place among the now significantly smaller waiting crowd, he found that she was nowhere to be seen. He shifted his own bag on his shoulder, sighed, and moved instead to sit at an unoccupied table. If only she’d stayed just a bit longer. </p>

<p>The employees who work at this urban mom and pop hardware store bicker and bond through each busy day.  The novel will highlight how a community is created ""where everybody knows your name"".  The regular customers come to the hardware store to fix more than faucets and lamps... they drop by to talk, share a laugh, be known for a moment.  The owner of the store is involved in local politics as a small business owner and has aspiration beyond the store that he inherited from his dad.   Long time employees are changed by the murder of a retired clerk who used to work at the hardware store.  </p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/wildflowerlens/novels/sunbreak-to-closing/stats,November 2015,"
<p>      The store was on the first floor below a residents' hotel where bathrooms were down the hall.  Next door was the Plush Bar, where rice queens reigned.  The store was located at the corner of Sacramento and Polk, between Snob Hill and the burnt peanut oil  splatter and shadow of the Tenderloin.  Pipes upstairs sometimes leaked and were patched up.  One time the entire pipe skeleton was ripped out and replaced with copper tubing.</p>
<p> It was the time in San Francisco when students at City College spoke about employment in a cocksure way.  No need to skitter and scrape for a job- just grab one from the lowest hanging branch.  It was the time before the dot com bubble.  A boxcar store opened up that sold wares from Internet companies.  I bought a set of metal camping plates there with the alphabet a is for apple, etc and then E=mc2.  </p>
<p>Down the block, a Bargain bonanza opened up where a bank once sat... in it you could find wine cutrate- deals scavenged from business fires.  See's candy, Swan's Oyster Depot, Bob's Diner, Korean BBQ, Middle Eastern sandwich shop.  Over the years, Good Vibrations opened up shop, along with a restaurant-grade kitchen supply store.  We had the Gap, Walgreens, along with coffee shops, pawn shops, further towards Market, the down and out shuffled in front of the shelter, along Van Ness, a skim skip nude bar, Mel's Diner, a mosque.</p>
<p>Trying to stitch together the old neighborhood… hard to do when you are no longer living there and so many people have moved away or died.  Can’t believe that Bob’s Diner closed down… what a fixture that was, with the bubble font letters, right next door to the broom closet sized upholstery, where shoes could be resoled.  The neighborhoods in flux- gentrifying, building boom razing institutions that once stood regally, as though they would always be there.  What is the half life of a restaurant?  How about the one that opened in the 70’s when Polk Gulch was the gay mecca?  So the streets I once knew so well, having walked them with wide strides 5 mornings and 5 or so nights… to and fro- I walked those hills and learned the beat and heart of those sidewalk cracks.  Past the library, city hall, arts and glitter symphony and ballet stages, stride past the huddled trenchcoat pack outside the shelter, the down and outs looking for a day job, past the buzzing bars and mompop corner stores, all of those warm places to dodge the night chill… bounce in and bop out… diva bars, gay and speedy, rush, lush, lingerie and massage parlors with steamed up windows, bargains plenty, 10 dollar blow jobs, crack for sale a block down from the farmer’s market where zucchini flowers can be found for $3 a pound.</p>
<p>So what, businesses fold and employees are let go.  What’s the value of a cashier anyway?  For those of us who have worked the grunt and whistle blow, heavy back and trying to get through til the end of the shift.  It’s a heroic feat to remain standing and serving all who come through the door.  This is customer service and those who stay get these laugh and worry lines- become fixtures in the neighborhood.  Seems like harry was always there, tinkering in the pipe and ballcock aisle… and Patrick as there longer than the boss- he remembers when S was a young man and unsure about taking over the business.  Who can you rattle off, those who have come and gone- do you remember all those faces- eerie, like ghosts, some apparitions just scraped the surface of this collective we called brownies hardware.  After a year or two, I settled in with the old timers… T winking sock it to you Sicilian sass mouth in the gray hoody and purple sweatpants… the manager who sat at the back doing the books,- rarely saw her at first but she changed bit by bit over the years. </p>
<p>Maybe we all changed each other… crammed in like we were- not a marriage of choice, but we had the choice to quarrel or get along… and how to keep peace when standing next to Crash, the old queen who would rattle on with anti-semitic, anti black, anti women viewpoints- all the while being queer as Dorothy’s ruby slipper.  J. so inclusive but draws the line at trannys… refused to talk with me when I admitted to being in a relation ship with one. </p>
<p>There is a hierarchy here… the real old timers and the passing by types- those who stayed no more than 5 years… faces remain, I forget their names.  How to bring them back to life?  In my minds’ eye- I am sure they are there- we worked together, shared more time together than families do.  We were the daytime family.  Hellos, shared milestones, rant and moan about work, our absent boss,- how to keep the mind and spirit alive… demanding customers and daily deadlines… the pace is what kept our jobs steady.  Hard to find retail employment with benefits like ours.  Pay was threadbare- had to darn my socks, wear my shoes until the soles were pocked with holes… but what about the gifts that my stint earned me.  The trance and fluid way that customers entered the store, found what they were looking for, then exited with an acknowledgment that they were there and that they mattered to someone.  I recognized you and saw you every day for 11 years.  That’s how close we all became… so when something happens to one of the crew- even one who has retired, it impacts us all.  </p>
<p>How did the news hit each of us, each of the customers- who went to the funeral?  Why didn’t I go?  That’s my biggest regret- while sluggin away day by day, I let the stories slip by, without documentation, they were lost.  What is left, the remnants of that time 10 years, 20 years ago… before harry and after harry- the world separates into these halves- before we were innocent- yes, there was 911 and we busied ourselves with supplying roles of plastic sheeting and duct tape- just in case- customers were urged to shop, to help America… we sold America flags with Made in Afghanistan labels… before that, we had the 1999 buildup to Y2K and filled the shelves with survival gear… so we were no enemy to battle and fear… commerce rattle… the scanner beeped over each item for sale- credit cards were exchanged- bus cards sold, hustle and wink- a sale completed and a new one begun.  The poem of our daily living- do you want a bag to go with that?  So after your death, we all had to face our own… and question, is this what I want to be doing 4 years from now, 40 years from now.  Can this go on- this pocket of people connected by need- to make a living and work together- but how to do this knowing that one of ours was met with a violent death- no fault of his own- and he did his time, barely pulled a year of social security checks.  Its not fair- he paid in- why can’t he get the orchids and oasis that comes with retirement?</p>
<p>It all stems to the inequities of our society…but how to explain away the murder of our harry?  Can’t say not fair- that’s not enough- and what about what happened to norma and his daughter vicki and his family web, so fragile and small… how does violence fester and sob up- from lack of education and choice.  How can one man take away anothers life- brutal fist force, where is the emphathy?  How does violence violate our sense of order.  This is not the way it is supposed to play out... this man worked hard all of his life, loved his family, he should have been given the rest of his years to quiet pursuits.  So we are pulled together once again, some of us living in SF, others moved away from the web, but we all recount the way we were when harry was still around.</p>

<p>The First Chroma is a story about a young boy named Alexandris Theylsson, his sister Sophie, and his best friend (at least eventually) Kyrie. The story takes place in the fantastical land of Illasai. A land that is home to creatures both strange and terrifying and to people of the same likeness. Magic takes a hold in the world in the form of Lumichra. Lumichra are colored light particles that make up everything. This is the reason for the name of the first chapter ""Magic has a Color"". there are several types of magic users however there is major focus on a few specific types. Necromancer: standard raise the dead type, uses black lumichra. Black lumichra are lumichra that have lost their light. Sophie is a Necromancer. Chronomancer: Chronomancers don't control time directly, instead they manipulate the flow of lumichra. Kyrie is a Chronomancer. The final main magic user is the Chromamancer: A chromamancer has full and total control of lumichra. Alexandris is a chromamancer and also the Chroma, a title given to him at some point in time.</p>

<p>It had been a long day but the three were happy to be home together. Sophie let out a sigh and walked to Alexandris, leaving the food unprepared.<br/>""Brother,"" She whispered, innocently. ""cook for me."" As the words left her lips she kissed him on the cheek and went to sit down next to their father. Without a word Alexandris finished setting the fire and began to prepare the food. They were having a rare meal tonight. A steak their father had managed to buy from a travelling merchant. Alexandris set the food out on the table, only he didn't notice the food. Rather he noticed his sister sitting there by their father. The realization hit him, his sister did none of the work.<br/>Glaring at Sophie, Alexandris thought of scaring her.

<p>I don’t know how I didn’t notice it before. I scavenged through his whole desk, in filing cabinets too neat to need to shuffle through, in overly-used books in his bookcases. I didn’t think about looking in something so obvious, so very mainstream as a contact list. Where better to find a beneficiary to a friendless man’s estate than in a rolodex?<br/><br/>The rolodex of Geoffrey Gables was packed. Every entry had a name, a description, a date, an address and an item, written in careful slanted cursive:<br/><br/>Francis Atwater: Mid-fifties; balding brown hair, limp, glasses, short; 1989; 17632 East Burlington Place Chicago, Illinois ; black fedora.<br/><br/>Jeanie Yi: ten; Asian-American, short black hair, tan, braces; 1999; 1009 Reagan Street Apartment 24C Chicago, Illinois; chinchilla (Rudy)<br/><br/>Tandy George: twenty-five; tall, slender, black skin, dresses conservatively; 1998; 1428 Fifth Street Chico, California; Marianne’s wardrobe<br/><br/>Ephraim Graff: eighties; Jewish, stooped-over, horn-rimmed glasses, gray hair, green eyes; 2003; 1998 Toronto Drive Chicago, Illinois; newspaper collection from the forties.<br/><br/><br/>If I took the time to go through all of them when I first found that rolodex, it would have taken me hours. Having already gone through every inch of his house, the items on these cards revived foggy memories in my mind. I had seen a lot of the stuff in my dedication to finding his will. The hat was on the coat rack, the chinchilla was at my house. Women’s clothing crowded the bedroom’s single closet. Older-looking newspapers occupied the bottom drawer in his desk. Could this really be his intentions? Why wasn’t there any note for guidance? Why hadn’t he written down in a document all of his four hundred plus beneficiaries? It was all in this rolodex. Gables must have known that he would never fulfill the customary duty of this rolodex. He knew he would never contact anyone he placed in it. Maybe that was information enough. Anyone that saw this man, for no one ever knew him, would know that if such a device were to be used by him, it wouldn’t be for eliciting information. This rolodex is his will.<br/>So for a man without anyone in his life to leave his estate, why waste the energy to divvy up every (assuming he listed everything) thing he owned to people he didn’t know well enough to leave everything to in the first place? <br/><br/>------<br/><br/>Geoffrey hung up his worn coat on the hat rack before closing the door to his home. The pressure of closing the only open pathway to his small two-story townhouse made the white curtains on the windows billow. He looked around the room. Everything had been as he had left it earlier that morning. The afghan that Marianne made him that Christmas was hanging on the recliner and this morning’s newspaper was still on the coffee table. The lights were on, the room was warm. However, Geoffrey felt weird. His brown wingtips made their way slowly and loudly on the tattered wood floors toward the staircase, each floorboard creaking and leaving behind a distinct echo in the entire front room. He took each step with reproach, too brave and scared at the same time to call for his wife. At the second-to-last step of the well, he peered into the room at the top of the stairs, his daughter’s room, which was dark and silent. As he turned his head the opposite way to the hallway, he could see the light on in his bedroom, and he felt a melting relief. As he went for the room, he had forgotten to take that last step up and fallen on his knees and hands. Before he had known it, Geoffrey had crawled a few feet along the rug runner and found himself looking up at the portrait that was taken of him and his wife their first year married. He had always admired Marianne’s long blonde hair that never seemed to grow dirty, or become ruffled. The photographer captured it perfectly. Geoffrey, using the wall blessed with his wife’s immortality, reached standing position once again and made again for his bedroom. <br/>He began to fear that Marianne might not even be there. He couldn’t fathom thought of where she would be. She never went out. She only hosted her mother and friends in the house. Her life was little Noelle and she would never do anything that might take time and care away from her daughter. He began to think that if she had actually been in the room, she would have heard him fall, wouldn’t she? It was a loud fall and almost any step in the house was audible, with the house being so ancient. His left hand traced the wallpaper on the walls of the hallway as he grew closer to the light. Perhaps, he thought, Marianne had fallen asleep with the light on during one of her many catnaps throughout the day. Geoffrey breathed a sigh of relief. Of course, she was always falling asleep during the middle of the day. She wanted to synchronize sleeping schedules with Noelle so that she could always be looked after. He began to walk at a more regular pace and lifted his hand from the wall. Through the oak door jam, the light almost seemed too bright, but he passed into the room to find the love of his life sleeping on her side facing the middle of the bed and facing Geoffrey. Her right arm was stretched out to suffice a pillow and she looked as perfect as ever in her day dress, knees tucked into a perfect angle. Curled in her left arm, a small and peach infant, with wisps of white blond hair curling at her temples. They were as still as statues. Geoffrey smiled and went to lie on the bed beside his sleeping beauties. He and his wife made a heart with their bodies around their child; Geoffrey felt a happiness and contentment beyond measure. He lifted up his hand and with his worked and warm knuckles, he went to stroke his wife’s porcelain cheek, but stopped at the touch. Her cheek was as cold as ice. Her face was as firm and unmoving as a picture. Geoffrey blinked his eyes too many times, hoping it would go away. With a rush of panic, Geoffrey whispered his wife’s name. He nudged her check softly with his thumb. He looked down at his daughter and noticed her partially open eyes and the vacant expression of her face that was masked by the beautiful moment from thirty seconds before. He bent down and kissed his daughter’s curls; her head was just as cold as her mother’s. Her fingertips were a light shade of blue and Geoffrey, rather than feeling a sense of immediate want, got up from the two he used to call his family, but no more. With his elbows on his knees and head directly down, Geoffrey ran his fingers over his eyebrows and pushed himself up. He walked towards the door, but didn’t look back. Before he left the room, he reached over, blindly, and turned the light off, and the house felt much more vacant.</p>

398,irlangel,Novel: Without Conviction,Genre: Literary,50398,"1,679",1,"
<p>Eugene ""Genie"" Penn is twenty-two years old, gay, autistic, and has the incredible ability to turn invisible at will. He also has been legally classified a super villain since the day he turned eighteen due to the government's new involvement in the super hero/super villain categorization process. Whether one is a ""super hero"" is no longer based on good deeds or heroic behavior, but whether or not one fits the very specific requirements to be legally categorized as such.</p>
<p>Genie's status as a super villain is out of his control, but it doesn't stop him from blaming himself and becoming increasingly doubtful of his own self-worth, which isn't helped by the fact that he's begun to idolize a popular celebrity super hero on TV. Meanwhile, the rest of his life seems to be falling apart around him: His best friend, Sylvia Robins, finds herself in a terrible accident and is demoted from super hero to villain, and his boyfriend of two years, Soren Masih, breaks up with him after one too many fights regarding Genie's lack of confidence in his identity.</p>
<p>However, when a mysterious stranger moves into Genie's neighborhood, a super girl named Beatrice Stark who's somehow managed to be promoted from villain <em>to hero</em>, Genie suddenly finds his life taking a turn for what seems to the better. Refusing to heed the warnings of Soren and Sylvia, for the first time in his life he's given the opportunity to experience what life as a super hero is like firsthand.</p>
<p>But is being a super hero really all it's cracked up to be?</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/irlangel/novels/without-conviction/stats,November 2015,"
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Have fun with the hero?”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Genie turned to walk out of the room. Soren followed him, which made him let out a frustrated sigh. “It was fine,” he said dismissively. But then he felt a surge of confidence rush through him. If Soren was going to slander Beatrice, he was going to speak up. And during the meeting had not been the best time, but now that they were alone… He turned around to face Soren. With a new air of confidence, he said, “Actually, it was really fun. We had a really nice time. She’s really nice, Soren.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Every super hero is ‘really nice’ to you.” Soren said, rolling his eyes. He locked up the meeting room and then they both walked down the hallway and out of the building. “Sylvia was ‘really nice,’ I remember you first telling me about her when we started dating. You went on about how she was the nicest person in the world. A real, true hero, you said. And now, look, she’s not here with you tonight, is she?” Genie did not respond to that. “William Delisle is ‘really nice,’ and you’ve never even spoken a word to him.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Genie still did not reply. He felt his face redden at the mention of William, and he wanted to speak up, defend him somehow. William was amazing, and he was a super hero. Of course he was nice. But knowing he could not defend himself from Soren, who always had some sort of counter argument, he remained silent.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once they were outside, illumined only by the lights on the front of the building now, Soren spoke again. “Can I ask you a question?” He did not wait for Genie to answer. Instead, he continued on with, “Have you told her that you and I used to date?”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Still no response from Genie.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I didn’t think so.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Genie’s brow furrowed and, his frustration finally boiling over, he turned to face Soren and snapped, “Have you ever thought about the fact that telling a stranger I’m gay is fucking dangerous?!” His hands clenched into fists, which hurt the cut on his palm just a bit. He flickered briefly. “Just like how I don’t use those stupid villain forums no matter how many times you told me to make an account on them. Because people have hacked those forums and given out the personal information of the villains on those sites before. Villains have been outed and lost their jobs for using those sites. Because unlike </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">you</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, living in your little bubble where everyone is proud of everything about themselves all the goddamn time, I live in reality, where I’m fucked over every day for being an autistic gay super villain.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It was Soren’s turn to be quiet for a moment. He stared at Genie, expression blank, and Genie was angry with himself that he could not read any emotion on the other man’s face. Then Soren cleared his throat and said, “You’re not living in reality, though. And my ability to find the positives in what and who I am doesn’t mean I’m </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">not</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.” He took a few steps towards the sidewalk. “Your ‘reality’ is a hellscape where everything hates you as much as you hate yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Your best friend for years was a super hero, your special interest for years has been a super hero, and now your new friend is a hero too, and you </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">know</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> you’ll never be accepted as one yourself. You broke up with a boy who genuinely liked you and who you had tons in common with </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">because</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> you two had too much in common. Of all the jobs in all of Idyllen, you chose one in a restaurant that specializes in </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">your least favorite kind of food</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.” Soren let out a long sigh. “I know you Genie, I dated you for two years, and it’s not hard to tell how much time you spend distancing yourself from anything that even vaguely reminds you of everything about yourself that you hate.”</span></p>

<p>Leslie nodded. “Just like I said.” Fae turned to Rivietta and Octavius. “Neither of us are making up our stories. I didn’t attack London, but <em>a</em> <em>vampire </em>did. And London didn’t take me, but <em>a werewolf</em> did.”</p>
<p>Octavius shook xyr head. “No werewolf touched you, vampire. I know the whereabouts of my pack, and I am certain none of them would have attacked you. Your accusation is an attack on my pack, and we do not appreciate it.” Xie grunted. “You didn’t even get a decent look at your attacker, is that right?”</p>
<p>Rivietta smirked. “Do those big ears of yours not work?” she asked. “Your wolf <em>clearly</em> stated that ey didn’t get a good look at eir attacker either. Your accusation could easily be seen as hate speech against our coven.”</p>
<p>A soft, bitter chuckle left Ea that none heard but Aubrey, who turned, ignoring the arguing leaders as she glanced to the fiery werewolf. “This has turned from anger towards nearly lost lives to anger towards an accusation. If they both just acknowledged neither did it we could go on with our lives. I don’t want to be here all night listening to this again,”</p>
<p>“Again?” Aubrey repeated.</p>
<p>Ea nodded. “Octavius and Rivietta have a history of this. I don’t know if war has ever actually been declared, but since our pack and their coven first came together this has happened.” Zie sighed and rolled hir eyes. “No idea what they get out of it.”</p>
<p>Aubrey bit her lip. “So what’s the point?” she asked quietly. Why should she be here if this was inevitable and recurring? She couldn’t stop this. This transcended a few accusations of attacks. This was a feud between these leaders that had been going on for <em>years</em>. She glanced to London and grew angry. Why had ey had her come if this had been going on for so long?! What was she supposed to <em>do</em>?!</p>

<p>Bonding Marks: Tattoos For the Soul</p>
<p>“Moyna, Siofra, do not let anyone see your marks. Your marks symbolize how extremely special you are, so no matter what happens you must hide them from anyone not in the immediate family. Okay? Can you do that for Mommy? Can you keep your marks a secret for Mommy?” Whenever I think of Mother I remember her telling us this and that we must keep the marks we were born with hidden from sight. It was not until much later that we understand why mother was so adamant about wanting them to stay hidden. In this world there are those with marks and those without them; both people can lead perfectly normal happy lives within society, but having a mark automatically characterizes that person as being a member of a Bond or a member of a soul mate. Meaning that there are some very bad people who will take advantage of them and sell them because of their marks. The person born with a mark is the Bonder, the bonder lives their life hoping that the person who discovers their secret is their bonded, and the Bonded is the person who if they meet naturally will develop their own mark which will be a replica of the bonder is mark only in the bonder is eye color. A Bond can be tricked if the Bonder has not found their Bonded yet. They only need thing needed to trick a Bond into forming is for the fake Bonded to have the proper eye color that matched the Bonders mark, if they do then they just need to get an identical tattoo of the mark in the Bonders eye color and reveal their mark to the Bonder. Unfortunately, this has happened a lot and many Bonders end up with someone who is not their Bonded.</p>
<p>Since Moyna and I had marks we were raised secluded away from other people and the outside world in order to protect us from being taken and forced into a fake Bond with someone. Moyna was lucky, her mark was tiny and easily hidden away. Her mark was of a tiny polished silver dragon eating its own tail about the size of a quarter and located on the bottom of her left heel. Meaning as long as she was wearing shoes or socks she could go outside without worry of someone trying to kidnap her and force a Bond onto her.</p>
<p>I was unlucky though, my mark was of detailed barbed wiring looped around my neck 2 times and done in varying shades of beautiful cerulean blue all around my neck (the barbed wiring on Agatsuma Soubi from Loveless for how it looks like). Such an obvious Mark meant that I was unable to easily go outside unless I wore something to cover them and even then I ran the risk of the covering slipping and someone noticing. It was not until the government passed a law making it so that there would be a very high punishment and fine if someone forced a Bonder into a fake Bond or kidnapped a Bonder with the expected intention of forcing them into a fake Bond. It was at this point that Moyna and I were allowed to go to public school, for the first time in our lives we were going to be able to be around other people our age that were not related to us constantly.</p>
<p>However, I would need to keep bandages wrapped around my neck, a collar, and a scarf on top of it all in order for my parents to allow me to go to school. But when wearing all there layers was compared to being forced to stay at home for the rest of my life until I happen upon my Bonded I was willing to be a little uncomfortable. The cover story we were to tell anyone who asked about the reason behind all the layers was that they were to cover up the resulting scars from an accident from my childhood, an accident starting with me trying to use the stove at 8 to make Moyna soup when she was sick and ending with burns on my neck alongside my Mark for the rest of my life, so other people would not be disgusted when talking to be and because the burns occasionally start hurting and it is better for them to be kept covered, as well as that I have a slight weak immune system so it is better for me to be kept warm. Which is what is actually true for Moyna, but we need everyone to think we both have this problem, it is a side effect of being a Bonder.</p>

<p>Super Grammy at the Mall</p>
<p>So we went out as a family to the mall today. This means Mommy, Daddy, Granny, Kane, Moyna, and I al went to the mall; it was fun at the beginning of the trip. The mall is really far from home, Daddy said the mall is only 45 minutes away. But, I think it is farther away and he is just being silly. Then while hopping we lost track of Granny, and she does not have a cell phone. So we walked all around the mall looking for her. We even went to mall security to try getting help finding her. After two hours of walking back and forth in the mall looking everywhere for Granny. She called Mommy on the phone… It turns out that Granny had got tired while at the mall and then got separated from us while we were shopping, so she just decided to walk home. But home is a two hour walk from the mall, so she called Mommy on her cell phone using the house phone. Mommy was so angry at Grammy for worrying us so much. But I was just SUPER glad that Grammy was safe at home. Once we found out that Grammy was okay we continued our shopping. But once we got home Mommy had a very loud discussion with Grammy on why she should not have just walked home alone and that next time she gets tired while we are all out somewhere to find one of us so we do not have to worry like that, ever again. Ha-ha, my Grammy is super amazing; being able to walk home all alone like that. I do not even know how to get home from anywhere but school. I have the coolest most awesome Grammy in the WHOLE world!!!</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Every morning, I wake up to my alarm going off. It is blaring some song or ringtone that I have already gotten used to over these past few weeks. “I almost slept in last week, I should probably change it” I think. While trying to climb out of my bunk bed; without giving into gravities cruel and merciless which is always begging to grasp hold of my body to pull me down and hit my head on the bed frame or to slip on my faithful and hardworking little mini-fridge as I accept his stubborn offer of “oh just step on me Lassie, it will let me go back to sleep quicker than if I wait for you to get around to it” he growls and whirls out in his deep and craggily voice as his fans whirl within him; which is him just being concerned for me as always. The stubborn old fridge gave his consent so I grudgingly accept stepping as lightly as I can from bed rail to his steady and chilly top, using his weight and size to assist me in sliding one leg forward and down to the safety that is the solid and warm floor. “Oh glorious warm carpeted floor,” I think as I turn still bleary eyes to the left and reach one hand up to the handle. Opening the creaky closet door and reaching up to my clothes where they hang, I grab some shirt or another and either some pants or shorts; I will deal with being self-conscious when I am brushed groomed and out the door, preferably with my bag and glasses… and shoes, this time or as Papa says “we will do it this time, but let us not make it a habit.” That was an embarrassing day, but that was yesterday and this is today.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>I think I saw them. Today when I was still just waking and dreaming, sensitive to the world and all its inhabitants. Before my barrier comes up and I hide myself away from them.</p>
<p>I saw them, the Granny I knew and the grandpa I never got the chance to know. They were riding their motorcycles into the distance, leaving me behind. Leaving me to face another day, another fight where I face my fears and those of others. To fight to face another day.</p>

<p>I Believe Music Makes Everything Better</p>
<p>I have always loved music. From being a fetus within mother, to a toddler crawling along the floor, to now. I have always enjoyed the music the radio provides me with; something as necessary as breathing for me, as it allows me to understand those around me without them looking to closely at me. Country music was my childhood lullaby for road trips and around town with mother and father. I am now constantly thinking of bits and pieces of lyrics, listening to a variety of music, going to class and singing along to the music playing from my phone, doing homework in the living room or bedroom and listening to playlists of songs I will rarely if ever even watch as the video means nothing compared to the show the song provides, or drawing some image that just came to mind on whatever is on hand and with whatever is available and singing along to the music the neighbors are playing.</p>
<p>The idea that music can make everything better never occurred to me before now. It just always was there for me, like the air that flows around and within me. The realization that music can make everything better comes from the fact music is a distinct part of who I am, what kind of person I am. It makes me the person I am today, flaws and all, mistakes and all. Without music I would not be the person I am today; I would just be a cruel and pale imitation and shadow of who I am now.</p>
<p>In elementary I adored when we could sing in class, even if I was terrorized by the thought of standing out with my voice as I could not hear pitch or regulate my volume to match the other students, not since the accident. My love of singing sometimes over-powered my fear and I would sing to the music as loud as my lungs could power, and my tiny self-esteem would allow me. I was never very athletic not like fierce Kane or graceful Moyna, but singing made me feel good about myself and helped me think positively about myself. Especially in the face of strong and fierce big brother Kane, and beautiful and graceful little sister Moyna, who would care about me, weird and awkward Siofra?</p>
<p>When Kane went and joined the military, before I entered the agonizing world of high school, I lost one of my most precious people. One of the few people who noticed me, no matter what. However, listening to music helped me get over the hole that was left in me. Music helps me stay happy and who I am; even when I feel like life is not worth it anymore, like I am not worth it, or just like giving up on everything. If I just play a song I adore, I can find the strength to get over any obstacle and move down the path to the next hurdle and opponent. This is why I believe in music.</p>
<p>In high school we lost Grammy. My friend introduced me to a sad and depressing, but beautiful and motivating song called “Life is Beautiful by Sixx: A.M.”. This was a song I thought would suit being played at the final ceremony for her life now that she had passed on. From when I first heard the song to even now, I find it motivating in its own depressing way. The song helped me get over her passing by making me remember her. She would not want anyone to cry in memory of her, she would want us to smile and laugh at the good memories we had shared together. Instead of mourning for as long as I wanted I moved on, while missing a crucial piece of myself. As the one who believed in me the most moved on to the next world.</p>
<p>After that I wanted to learn as many of the lyrics to the songs that I enjoyed listening to in order to remember them. Therefore, I looked up the lyrics to every song that I liked. Which I then sang until my beloved songs were softly whispered at every free moment or during any mindless task without my conscious decision and always in the back of my mind. This year I am learning how to sing so my music can and will grow to be an amazing sound which Mother and Father will be proud to hear, and Kane and Moyna happy to listen to. Until I never have to fear my voice annoying the people around me, when I sing at any moment.</p>
<p>Music lets me be artistic in a way that requires no tools or mediums, other than my own voice and imagination for the limitless possibilities I can make from singing alone. Music effects the way I feel. If I have a fight with my parents, I can play any song I like and get into a better mood. So long as music puts me into the positive side of the spectrum; I do not remember painful thoughts of my grandma.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>“Push through the pain,” he said.</p>
<p>“It will make you stronger,” he said.</p>
<p>“If it does not hurt you are not working hard enough,” he said.</p>
<p>“Pain is weakness leaving the body,” he said.</p>
<p>Well you know what? His logic, his wonderful apparently Godsend logic led my parents to not realize I fractured my ankle.</p>
<p>“Oh? It hurts to run? Push through the pain.” They said.</p>
<p>“Oh? It hurts to kick and punch? Push through the pain.” They said.</p>
<p>“Oh? It hurts to grapple? Push through the pain.” They said.</p>
<p>“Oh? It hurts to spar? Push through the pain.” They said.</p>
<p>Well you know what? Their logic, their wonderful apparently Godsend logic led my parents to not realize I fractured my ankle.</p>
<p>Until the teacher made some comment about it.</p>
<p>“Siofra, why is your ankle wrapped?” teacher asked.</p>
<p>“Siofra, why are you limping?” teacher asked.</p>
<p>“Siofra, why are you crying?” teacher asked.</p>
<p>“Siofra, what is wrong?” teacher asked.</p>
<p>Well you know what? Teacher is logic, teacher is wonderful Godsend logic led my parents to realize I fractured my ankle.</p>
<p>But not until the teacher made some comment about it.</p>
<p>“Can you please not take me to karate today?” I asked.</p>
<p>“My ankle hurts,” I said.</p>
<p>“It hurts really bad,” I said.</p>
<p>“Kane where is the bandages?” I asked.</p>
<p>Well you know what? My logic, my wonderful non-Godsend logic led my parents to not believe I hurt my ankle.</p>
<p>So my mom takes me to the doctor.</p>
<p>“What happened?” the doctor asks.</p>
<p>“She is been complaining about her ankle lately,” mom answers.</p>
<p>“How long has it been hurting?” the doctor asks.</p>
<p>“I think she started to complain about it a couple months ago, but she stopped complaining about it lately,” mom answers.</p>
<p>“That long, huh? Why did not you bring Siofra in earlier to see me?” the doctor asks.</p>
<p>“Why are you barely bringing her in?” the doctor asks.</p>
<p>“Her teacher made a comment about her limping in school,” mom answers.</p>
<p>“Why did not you bringing her in when she first mentioned pain in her ankle?” the doctor asks.</p>
<p>“She is always complaining to try getting out of going to karate. We did not think she had actually hurt herself,” mom answers.</p>
<p>“Well it feels like Siofra did hurt her ankle,” the doctor says.</p>
<p>“I want to order an X-ray just to be sure that her ankle is healing properly and if we need to put a cast on it.” The doctor says.</p>
<p>So we go to the hospital for my x-ray, and it turns out that I did hurt my ankle. It was fractured and guess what I did on it?</p>
<p>I did running in school from the playground to the fence and back.</p>
<p>I did grappling in karate.</p>
<p>I did sparring in karate.</p>
<p>I did kicks in karate.</p>
<p>I did punches in karate.</p>
<p>All with a fractured ankle. Where is the instructors Godsend logic now? The logic that led to aggravating my ankle for a few months? The logic that led to my ankle healing while still being in use, while still in karate?</p>
<p>The logic that led me to cry in pain and agony at night as my ankle throbbed and the bones scrapped?</p>
<p>The logic that led me to bite my tongue, and lips, and arms, and wrists? Just so I could “push through the pain” as the instructors said?</p>
<p>The logic that led me to learn to wrap a fractured ankle for school? Just so I could be able to force myself through torture to perform to the instructors expectations?</p>
<p>How about that complaint of mine? How about the instructor is logic, the instructors Godsend logic? Especially when the instructor is logic is pushed onto my parents a few years later? How about that?</p>
<p>Well remember, just “push through the pain, it will make you stronger” as you lie in bed in pain and torture and agony after class. Because this is what I had to go through for “just a couple months” before I stopped; because no one believed me when I said my ankle hurt. Until the teacher made a comment about me limping. But it is okay, just know that if you bite your wrist bite the top. It will bruise less later on. If you bite your hand bite the back. It will hurt less later on.</p>

<p>“I am going to tell you a secret,” I whisper to Leo. Leo is one of the closest males I have as a friend that is closest to my age, and even then he is a year older. Leo looks at me through his sunglasses, his lips coming up into a smirk as he asks “and which secret will this be?” while taking a sip of his drink, some expensive thing I ca not be bothered to remember the name of only that it is obnoxiously sweet with a tart sour after taste that you feel for hours after. I narrow my different colored eyes at him, “a secret that if I ever hear anything about from anyone else, I will punch your arm so hard it will be bruised for weeks, and you know how hard I can hit when I put my mind to it.” I retort glaring at him while drinking some of my chocolate milk, stealing the chocolate milk he was forced to get for lunch from his plate when he recoils in horror.</p>
<p>And he does know, the last time some punk nosed brat and his gang of wannabe rebels tried starting stuff with us over our differences from the other more normal looking and absolutely boring students in this prison called High School, I punched their juvenile delinquent so hard in the gut he passed out from the pain and shock of the impact. And that was me pulling my strength and not getting up from the floor in order to get more leverage. That baby gang ran so fast from us they left a breeze and skid marks on the concrete. One act of minor, and frankly pathetic, violence and we have not been bothered in a month. The peace from it will not last long, it never does where idiots and delinquents are involved.</p>
<p>But Leo recoils in horror, and like the silly idiot he is spills some of his expensive and obnoxious drink onto the homework I just finished helping him finish doing. So like the loving friend I am, I give him a very light “love tap” to his arm; it will only be bruised for 5 days after all. “Siofra~~” he cries, now clutching his hurting arm, “what did you do that for?!?!” he exclaims. “Look at your lap!” I growl at him with narrowed eyes pointing at the wet papers in his lap. Looking down he squeaks, like the silly nitwit he is, and grabs my unused napkins to dry the already damp paper before it smudges the writing anymore and makes it become completely unreadable to the teacher and need to be redone. Chuckling under my breathe I reach forward and grab the papers from his panicking hands, to dry them myself. When Leo gets into this panicky of a state he is more liable to ruin whatever he is holding than he is to actually make it better.</p>
<p>“Any ways~~ Leo~~ the secret~~” I sing song to him, him looking to me with a kicked puppy look “yeah?” he whimpers out. “I will tell you after school, meet me in the library so I can tell it to you. Okay?” I tell him teasingly with a foxy smirk smile on my face. “Su-sure,” he stutters out as the bell to end lunch rings. “Maybe he will know what to do,” I think as I watch him scramble to gather his schoolwork together and shovel it into his anime covered messenger bag. “Later” we say waving goodbye to each other and the others as we separate from where we were in the group to head to class.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>“I want to spread my wings,” I idly thought while looking out over the ocean tide from the thick tree root sticking out from the craggy cliff face I was perched on. “SIOFRA!!” I hear yelled in exasperation from somewhere either above or below me. Probably someone looking for me from above me on this crumbling cliff. Lazily glancing up, I catch sight of the glimmer of dark crimson wings some yards above me, Leo he is the only one who know I would escape to this perilous place. “I will be right up!!” I holler back to Leo in my lazy drawl. Glancing back out from my perch to sweep my mismatched over the sea, I draw in a fortifying breath and turn my back to the sea that draws me into its lovely gaze to arrange my old beat up sketch pad back into my escape pack, the pack I always grab to take everywhere when I need to get away from my <em>wonderful beloved </em>family. Once my pad is safely stashed away within the pack and the pack is secured onto my back between where my own dull dishwater gray wings reside on my back, wrapped up in stretchy beige bandages after the fall I took last week. I reach up one hand and grab onto the rock to begin my ascent back up to the top of this ruined cliff. To the top where my best guy friend Leo is waiting for me to finish my ascent while peeking over the edge, wings strained and tense ready to take flight in the unlikely event I should slip on the climb towards the bottom, and to lead me back to my family where they will be sitting in their posh chairs coming up with more ways to break down my self-confidence.</p>
<p>After at least 30 minutes of highly risky unharnessed rock climbing, which is not to be done in real life no matter what, I finally am at the top. “Well are you waiting for an engraved invitation to help me up?” I teasingly ask Leo while peeking over the edge of the cliff. Chuckling he kneels down to take my hand and help pull me over the edge, his vibrant crimson wings still strained high in case something unexpected happens. Once I am over the edge and a couple feet away, I turn back to the ocean to whisper out “it is beautiful is not it?” to Leo. “Yeah” he whispers back, taking my hand which he still has not let go off to pull me from the spell of the sea and back to the earth. Sighing he uses our interlinked hands to lead me back to my family is house, it may be the ancestral house but it will never be my home. My home is with Leo and the rest of our friends, not this huge cold ancient mansion.</p>

<p>Within this world I live in, words can hold power. The ones with the ability to put power into their words, their spells, are considered superior to others, they are called casters. But for all their power they still answer to the call of those who provide the strength to power the words and take damage when a spell connects, these people are called shields. When a shield and a caster come together they can form a pair. People in a pair almost always end up in a romantic relationship and married. To break a pair is to destroy their power, so it rarely if ever happens.</p>
<p>By the 5<sup>th</sup> birthday a person will exhibit if they hold magical potential and if they do will then go on to general training in how to be either a shield or caster, at this age they are referred to as undetermined. The act of the person is magic showing their position in the pair is called presenting. By the 10<sup>th</sup> birthday a person who holds magical potential will exhibit which position they will hold in a pair, this means their magic has become determined and they are referred to by either their position in a pair or as just being determined. From 10 to 16 casters and shields form temporary tentative pairs. At the age of 16 to 18 they begin to form their semi-permanent pairs, these pairs are harder to break then the previous pairs they would have formed but breaking them still holds no major risks besides slight magical exhaustion. From 18 to 20 is when the bonds become permanent. At this age bonds must be formed in order to keep the power of the shield and caster from beginning the process of corroding their bodies from the inside out until it eventually corrodes their body too far and kills them in an explosion of magical power which has the minimum calculated expected potential to destroy everything within a half mile, hence why permanent bonds are formed. When a person shows a distinction for their position they are entered into a national database in order so that if they end up not finding a partner of their own to form a pair with, this way they can be saved from magical backlash and put into the best pairing with the highest chance of staying together. If a person does not become a Determined by the age of 13 they have a pair of special magical restrictors placed onto them in the form of metallic looking jewelry. The restrictors are placed in pairs; the main restrictor is placed around the neck like a collar and acts as the central command system for a warning system in case the magic starts to corrode the wearer, one restrictor is placed on each arm, and finally one restrictor is placed on each leg. The restrictor on the limbs can be anywhere along the limb as long as it is actually located upon the limb.</p>
<p>I come from a family of powerful Casters and Shields. Everyone in my family who is a caster can cast high powered spells and everyone who is a shield can take many high powered hits from spells. Well, everyone in my family but me. But I only showed magical potential at 5. But now that I am already 14 I still have not had my magic show which position in a pair I will hold. This has made me the black sheep, the outcast, within my family and within my school. Someone in my predicament likely will not form a pairing; I will end up being forced to undergo an apparently torturous surgery to force my magic into a situation where it has to show what position I will hold. Since I am undeclared, someone whose magic has not distinguished itself, I am unable to participate in the practice training battles used for the declared, people whose magic has shown them to be either a shield or caster, to learn what style of fighting and magic they are suited for in order to know what type of partner they will end up looking for later on and forming their permanent pairs with.</p>
<p>Growing up the oldest daughter in my family, my parents would always talk of how with our pedigree of being strong determined as soon as I graduated from my undetermined status I would have my pairing picked out from someone else of equal pedigree to ours by my parents. My potential partner would be picked out, like a prearranged marriage, and we would not meet until the day we started the process of solidifying the pair bond.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I still have not become a Determined even at my age of 14, so my younger fraternal twin sister Moyna, who presented as a Shield at the age of 9, took the Caster Draco Dupre, who was once one of my childhood friends and crush, as her partner after he became a Determined at 9 also.</p>
<p>Because I am still Undetermined I am picked on by the Determined in my class and within the school. Everyone follows the lead of my twin, the pretty and perfect Moyna Kuran. One of the only people in my class who do not use me and that is not one of my friends is the Shield Determined Ciel Walker, a fellow noble and the holder of my most recent crush. The only reason Walker-san does not belittle me is because he is also belittled by our classmates, because he has a hard time forming bonds when trying to train. But he is out of my league because he has had feelings for Moyna for as long as I can remember, if they had not both presented as Shields I think they would have gotten together.</p>
<p>Of my two closest friends who have still stayed beside me even though they get bullied for it is the Caster Leo Raven and his partner the Shield Rikki Datsun; all my other friends have become increasingly distant the longer it takes for me to present. They both try their best to help me get my magic to present, but some people need either a traumatic incident to present or the surgery which invokes the magic of the Undetermined into thinking they are undergoing extreme trauma and therefore they forcefully and painfully present.</p>

<p>Language, Gender, and culture</p>
<p>There are many groups or communities that we should try to better understand. The people may be of a different race, culture, religion, language, or country. However, we can all benefit from seeing the world through each other is eyes. But, have you ever imagined a world where the world is always on mute?</p>
<p>If someone tells you they are deaf, what do you think? Do you start talking louder or do you just walk away from them? It is typically understood and thought that the deaf can hear you when you yell at them. That a hearing-aid can give them back perfect hearing. That they are mentally disabled and should either be pitied or avoided because you might become like them. The hidden reality though is that the deaf are just as smart as any other hearing person. It is common today to dismiss the deaf as not being fully capable humans.</p>
<p>The deaf community can express themselves through signing, body language, and even lip reading. It is also made up of all religions, cultures, races, and each country has its own form of sign. How many hearing would try to learn these things to be able to communicate if they lost their hearing? Although they rarely admit as much, many hearing people take for granted that they can hear what is going on around them.</p>
<p>People may laugh at the way the deaf talk, if they went through speech training at all, but for the deaf to talk even when they cannot tell if their pronouncing the words correctly even with the help of a hearing-aid is a struggle. The hearing can know when their words are mispronounced or the volume wrong, unlike the deaf. If I was deaf I would not want to try to speak if I knew the hearing would laugh at any mispronouncing that I could make, would you?</p>
<p>These are just a few of the reasons I can think of that the deaf community might be unnecessarily pitied and thought to need all the help the hearing can give them. Even when they are just as capable as the hearing. Yet some readers may challenge my view that the deaf are just as capable as the hearing.</p>

<p>All my life I have heard “one person makes all the difference.” I have always heard that if you try hard enough, you can succeed at what you put your mind to. However, I have also heard that if you put all the effort in the world, you will not succeed at what you put your mind to. After hearing these two conflicting sayings all my life, I want to know which one is true. When I was about 5 years old, my grandpa came down with cancer for the second time in his life. When he had it the first time and went through chemotherapy, he got very sick as a result. When he had cancer the second time, he decided his body was too weak to handle the treatment again as well as his own spirit and the spirit of our family. My grandpa fought long enough to see all his grandchildren, and then, he gave up the fight.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Over the weekend I went to a lake with my friends. I helped cook one of the meals and helped with making one of the lunches for our group. On the way to the cabin we were staying at I rode as navigator in my friend is vehicle. We younger members of the large group of friends were kicked out of the cabin on Saturday and Sunday to go down to the lake by ourselves. Finally, I hung out with my nearest and dearest of my friends for a very fun and pleasurable weekend.</p>
<p>This time was very different from last year when we went down to the lake and cabin because I went in the water only one time and did not get a chance to ride on the boat. Compared to last year when I spent most of my time out and in the lake. This year I worked on homework instead of watching a black and white classical movie with everyone else in the cabin. On Saturday night, I was tasked with washing the dishes as they were finished being used by the other members of the team I was on, whom actually knew how to make the meal, since I did not know how to make the meal. Over the trip I was in pain from my wisdom tooth starting to come in after Saturday night. This time at the cabin, I did karaoke for the third time ever in my life. It was the same as last time because some of my friends were there. I rode up with my friend and rode back in her car, whereas last time we went on this trip she had to leave on Sunday so she could be able to go to work in time on Monday.</p>
<p>It was an overall positive and fun experience. Other than missing the movie to work on school work and my wisdom tooth acting up, I had a lot of fun. It would have been better if my wisdom tooth had not tried coming in at that time. Next time we go to the cabin will be a better trip because I will not end up being able to go at the last minute. I will be planning on going on the cabin trip and will not rush to get my things packed the night before. I cannot wait for the next entertaining trip where I will get to play other group leadership games with my friends.</p>

<p>A Death Poem</p>
<p>In Loving Memory of My Grandma</p>
<p>I think about you sometimes</p>
<p>Never for long</p>
<p>Never on purpose</p>
<p>Never for as long as I know I should.</p>
<p>It seems like just yesterday</p>
<p>You were beside me,</p>
<p>We were bickering like family does. The insults we threw at one another</p>
<p>The cruel whispers at all times</p>
<p>They were softened, They were softened, In the way only family can do. It was just a normal day, Just a normal night, The only difference, the only insignificant difference. Your shoulder hurts, You said it was from your fall, “Don’t worry about it,” you said. If it doesn’t matter, why were you on the floor? If I’m not to worry, why did I find you? Mom and dad took you to the hospital You didn’t want an ambulance, That was a mistake. Why did you make a liar of me? Mom stayed with you, dad came home to stay with me. I said you would be fine, I said you would be mad at all this fuss. I said you would be fine. Why did you make a liar of me? I only saw you once. I didn’t like you in that bed, The beeping, The tubes, The needles, The pitying looks, The rasping breathing. I didn’t like you in that bed, I only saw you once. That was a mistake. I think about you sometimes Never for long Never on purpose Never for as long as I know I should. That is a mistake.</p>

<p>When I walked onto my schools rival campus two years ago, I did not know what I was getting into. But, nothing could have prepared me for the sight of hundreds of people crowded onto the field. I was thinking it was going to be another of those “you are coming along with us [my parents] because you live under our roof and therefore have to obey us” deals. You know, those deals where you stand off to the side acting like you are not even there, because you do not know anybody and do not want people to think you are there willingly. Instead, I show up and am immediately put to work. There was so much I had to do to help out.</p>
<p>First step; discover what the heck a luminary is and where in the world the luminary stand is in this crowded mass of people, tents, and signs. I was told luminaries were white bags that you decorate then at night they light them up along the track, why were people going to burn something they had worked on? I just could not understand that concept. When I finally found the stand I was immediately put to work, there were luminaries that had been preordered and still needed to be made. I set to work on the luminaries as other members ran the stand for people who wanted to buy and make their own bag(s). To make a bag we put the ordered name onto the pristine canvas then wrote “In Celebrating, In Remembrance, or In Hope” depending on what the commissioner had marked for the person. It was pleasurable but strenuous to spend all day writing, coloring, decorating, and running small errands for the stand.</p>
<p>Eventually, sunset came and we gathered the luminaries and took them to our tent. Once at the tent we filled the luminaries with sand along the bottom and put a tea candle inside, a tea candle is a very little short candle, and settled them along the track on both sides. When the bags were all in place, we separated and lit the candles with lighters. The generators that powered the lights were turned off as we light the candles. People moved to the stage in the center off the field, once the lights were out, to hear a talk about RELAY FOR LIFE and see a slideshow featuring the survivors and those who lost the fight against cancer.</p>
<p>It was so inspirational to hear the talks from people who have been affected by cancer, including those whom never had cancer or can no longer remember a time when the person did not have cancer. All I could think as we did the Survivors Lap is that for just a measly second I am part of something so much bigger than I could have ever imagined being. While walking the lap I felt closer than before during that day to all the other people.</p>

<p>Siofra in High School Life Outside of School</p>
<p>In the past year I have hiked 10 miles in the Havasupai Indian Reservation in the Colorado River, Arizona; gone to Lake Arrowhead on 2 different weekends, seen 2 amazing plays and met the actors in LA, had my house rebuilt, seen my brother reenlist with the military, seen my sister get into middle school, and participated in Relay for Life. Of all these things that I never would have imagined doing at my current age; I am most proud to have been part of Relay for Life.</p>
<p>When I walked onto Kuronu is rival schools campus, Mikantsu, I did not know what I was going to have to be prepared for. But, even if I had prepared for something it would not have been enough to prepare me for the sight of hundreds of people crowded onto Mikantsu is field. I was thinking it was going to be another of those “you are coming along with us [my parents] because you live under our roof and therefore have to obey us” deals. Those ones where you just stand off to the side acting like you are not even there and willing time to speed up so you can make an escape. Instead, I show up and am immediately put to work, no wall flowering for me then. There was so much I had to do to help Mariana [my brother, Kane is, girlfriend] with. First step; discover what a luminary is then find where the luminary stand is in this crowded mass of people, tents, and signs. I was told luminaries were white bags that you decorate then at night they light them up along the track, why were people going to burn something they had worked on? I just could not understand that concept. When I finally found the stand I was immediately put to work, there were luminaries that had been preordered and still needed to be made. Together Rin [another girl who was friends with Mariana] and I set to work on the luminaries as my brother, mom, and sister ran the stand for people who wanted to buy and make their own bag(s).</p>
<p>To make the bag we put the name that was ordered down onto the pristine canvas then wrote “In Celebrating, In Remembrance, or In Hope” depending on what the commissioner had marked for the person. It was fun but fatiguing to spend all day writing, coloring, decorating, and running small errands for the stand. Eventually, sunset came and we gathered the luminaries and took them to our tent. Once there we filled them with approximately 1 inch of sand along the entire bottom then they had a tea candle put inside. Once we filled a wagon a group of Boy Scouts laid them along the track on both sides. When the bags were all in place, we separated and lit the candles with lighters. The generators that were powering the lights were turned off. People moved to the stage in the center off the field to hear a talk about RELLAY FOR LIFE then to see a slideshow featuring all the survivors and those who lost the fight against cancer.</p>
<p>It was so inspirational to hear the talks from people who have been affected by cancer, including those whom never had cancer or can no longer remember a time when the person did not have cancer. All I could think as we did the Survivors Lap is that for just a measly second I am part of something so much bigger than I could have ever imagined being. While walking the lap I felt closer than before during that day to all the other people. I remembered my grandfather, whom had cancer before I was born survived and got it again when I was a child about 8 or 9 years old and passed away; my great grandmother, who died within the year of finding out she had it when I was 6; my great-uncle, whom got cancer once and had it be terminal; my grandmother, whom thankfully received the diagnosis that two different and completely unrelated tumors were benign; and my mom is cousin, whom survived it with just losing a significant portion of his nose.</p>

<p>An Ode to Moyna</p>
<p>Why did our paths have to end?</p>
<p>Why did everything we stand for end?</p>
<p>We were young, with nothing before us but our dreams.</p>
<p>But the dreams faded,</p>
<p>As life set in.</p>
<p>But, reality stepped in,</p>
<p>And it broke your precious crown,</p>
<p>Play make believe on a cold November Eve.</p>
<p>You the princess and,</p>
<p>Me the jester and,</p>
<p>Him the joker.</p>
<p>With stories of dreams.</p>
<p>Where monsters are banished with a wish,</p>
<p>And beasts slayed with a kiss.</p>
<p>We were nothing if not dreamers,</p>
<p>We were nothing if not young.</p>
<p>But life killed the dream,</p>
<p>Left the story half told,</p>
<p>On a cold November wind.</p>
<p>As our paths had to change,</p>
<p>As the jester lost her smile.</p>
<p>As the joker lost his heart.</p>
<p>As the princess lost her crown.</p>
<p>Why did our paths have to end?</p>
<p>Why did everything we stand for end?</p>
<p>We were young, with nothing before us but our dreams.</p>
<p>But the dreams faded,</p>
<p>As life set in,</p>
<p>And broke us down.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>I am losing my joy and mind.</p>
<p>Are you happy?</p>
<p>I am losing the mask.</p>
<p>Are you happy now?</p>
<p>I have lost everything I held dearest to me,</p>
<p>Gave it all up on a silver platter to you, for you.</p>
<p>Are not you happy now?</p>
<p>How much more of myself do you desire?</p>
<p>How much more that I have left must I give for you?</p>
<p>How much more must I sacrifice to you?</p>
<p>Because the road we are walking,</p>
<p>It will lead us straight to hell.</p>
<p>Fore the road to hell is paved,</p>
<p>In the good intentions that were done.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>I climb into bed and it is like I am next to you again. The body pillow I have lying next to me in my bed, it reminds me of when you would be lying next to me. Relaxing after a hard day at school, after a hard day of working, and after a night of hiking and sleeping together on a camping trip somewhere within the beautiful mountains. Do you remember? Do you remember my smile? Do you remember my hugs? I remember yours. I remember your smile. I remember your voice. I remember your hugs which you gave me after you would walk me to class. I miss you so much, the distance in between us and around us seems to grow every day. I do not want to leave you. I never wanted to leave you. That was never my intention, I never wanted that to be my ending. I never wanted this to be our ending. But the distance seems to grow every day, and I know that you will forget me, someday. Just like I know, that I will forget you, someday. And it hurts so much, it hurts so very much… it hurts so very much to know that eventually we will be nothing more than just a memory. I know that we could be, all that we would be, will just become nevermore potentially. So last for me, smile for me, so laugh for me, so hug the next person you love more for me. Do not let them know what they could have and what they could be, maybe eventually become nothing. I want to hold you and love you still, but the chance has already passed us by.</p>

<p>Tamers and Magical Pets</p>
<p>INTRO:</p>
<p>Once a child shows they have the magical potential to become a Tamer, or in other words the magical potential to form a bond with a Changeling, they are put into lessons on what the different types of Changeling is are and how they will care for their Changeling once it hatches. A child typically shows their potential by their 5<sup>th</sup> birthday, this is done by them releasing their magic in one of the Flame colors as a Flame developing on their forehead and their eyes sometimes changing color to match their Flame. The Flames are a sign of the users personality and classification; {yes, this is from Katekyo Hitman Reborn}</p>
<p>Rain: a person with a typically tranquil spirit; light blue flames.</p>
<p>Storm: a person with a typically fiery spirit; red flames.</p>
<p>Lightning: a person with a typically hardy spirit; green flames.</p>
<p>Cloud: a person with a typically loner spirit; purple flames</p>
<p>Sun: a person with a typically supportive spirit; yellow flames.</p>
<p>Mist: a person with a typically hidden spirit; light purple-gray flames.</p>
<p>Sky: a person with a typically calm spirit; orange flames.</p>
<p>In honor of becoming a potential Tamer, children are put through lessons to learn how to control their Flame so they do not risk harming themselves and to be able to use them safely in the future. Every year the Tamers who have turned 8 are brought to a pen where they are allowed to find the Changeling Egg they will be gifted with from which will hatch a Changeling who will grow to be their partner. A Changeling Egg is an egg from the magical species of Flame animals Changelings, that nobody knows the original appearance of only what their partner hatches to look like. While a Changeling is in their egg they reach out to find the most compatible Tamer that matches their Flame, so when the Tamer comes they can tap into their power and find each other. Once picked the Changeling spends 2 years within their egg being carried around and exposed to their Tamers Flame while within their shell so they can tap into their human partners Flame in order to develop and cement their bond between them and to develop into a Changeling that complements the Tamers personality. Depending on the Tamer the species of Changeling the Changeling Egg will develop and hatch into is different.</p>
<p>But this is all common knowledge, to anyone growing up in this world. What is lesser known is that after the Changeling hatches the Changeling will attempt to draw and lead the Tamer to another Tamer in order for the Tamers to form a Bond. A Bond is when two Tamers come together to form a team, because two Tamers putting their magic together is always stronger than they are alone. If the Bond is successful they might even form a Pair. A Pair is when two Tamers have successfully formed a team and their Changeling partners have also formed a team; once a Pair is formed it is very difficult and painful to break. But Pair breaking rarely occurs, because they are both very difficult to form, it takes time for it to develop, and the Changeling draws the Tamer to the person whom most people consider to be their soul mate. It is the goal of every child to become a Tamer so they can find their soul mate, although even those who do not become Tamers can still find their soul mate. I think the Changeling drawing the Tamers together just makes it so much easier on the search for your soul mate because you enter the team already knowing you are both highly compatible if the Changelings are drawing you together.</p>
<p>Today is the day all to be 8 year old potential Tamers get to go to the pen to find our Changeling Egg. I ca not wait!! I am SSSOOOOO excited!!!! I hope Moyna, that is my younger fraternal twin sister in case you did not know, and I end up getting Changeling Eggs that will hatch to be the same Changeling Species later on. Oops! I almost got caught by Miss. Amber, our Teacher, daydreaming. I should start paying more attention to the teacher, we are getting ready right now to head down to the pen right now and I do not want to be late!</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Changeling Eggs!?!?!</p>
<p>Everyone in the group is following Miss. Amber down to the Changeling Egg Pen; since I was distracted by my thought I am a bit behind sissy and the rest of my friends. “Moyna~, minna~ (everyone) wait for Sia (my nickname)!” I cry out racing to catch up to the others. While rushing to catch up I bump into Ciel Walker, he is a kind sort of cute boy in my class, BU-BUUT I do NOT have a crush on him, boys are icky and have cooties.</p>
<p>But I bumped into Ciel, who had turned at the sound of my rushing footsteps. “GYA!” he cried falling down from my knocking him over in my rush to get to the others and falling on top of him, his back hitting the floor with a dull thud.</p>
<p>“AHH! Oops are you okay Walker-kun? I did not hurt you did I? Do, do you have to go to the nurse?” I cried out to him in a panic, tears welling up in my brown eyes, I did not want him to be hurt because of my clumsiness. While asking my stream of questions to him, I got onto my knees while still kneeling on his stomach to check over if he was hurt.</p>
<p>“Now he will never like me!!” I thought to myself in embarrassment; my cheeks turning a slightly darker shade of red.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, I-I am fi-fine,” he stuttered out his pale face slowly turning red from embarrassment at the scene we were causing. “He looks so cute like this” I thought, a light blush forming on my own face while I looked at him. “Cu-cute~” I whispered under my breath as I leaned closer to him, my blush becoming even brighter.</p>
<p>“Ah but, umm, co-could you, ah could you let me up now?” he asked, since I was hovering over him still; his blush fading now that I was no longer streaming questions at him.. Not giving him space to get back up on his feet unless he knocked me to the floor.</p>
<p>“Ahh~ Sia~ what is taking so long back there? Hurry up.” I heard Moyna call back to me, questioning what was the hold up as she came pushing through the other students, who were ignoring us being on the floor, to get towards us.</p>
<p>“Eh? Why are you on the floor Walker-san?” Moyna asked once she saw the position we were in; Ciel on his back with me resting on his stomach, my knees at his waist and hands beside his head, my hair forming a sort of curtain around our faces. Ciels face turned an even brighter red than it was earlier, once he saw Moyna standing over us and looking down at us in question, an adorable questioning look on her face. “Does, does Ciel like Moyna?” I questioned in my head, a little upset and disappointed.</p>
<p>“AHH! That is right, here let me help you up!” I exclaimed, wanting him to focus back onto me, grabbing Ciels arm and pulling him up suddenly.</p>
<p>“OUCHYY!” we both cried out. Me pulling him up suddenly did not work out very well, since Ciel ended up bumping foreheads with me. Now we both have matching red marks on our foreheads.</p>
<p>“Alright everyone, gather up into your lines. We are here!” the three of us heard Miss. Amber call out. Turning our heads to where her voice came from we saw the others in the class watching us make a scene of ourselves. Brilliant red blushes sprouted onto our faces in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Coming!!” we chorused as the three of us ran to get into our positions in line. Moyna and I right next to each other in line as we always are; nervously we reached so our hands could be together for reassurance. Ciel got into his spot a bit further down the line. “He looks nervous too,” I thought to myself, sending a quick glance towards him a blush highlighting the tops of my cheeks.</p>
<p>“Alright then. Now that everyone is here” Miss. Amber started, sending a pointed look at Ciel and I to ensure we will not cause another distraction. “We will go over the rules of finding our Changeling Egg and how we know if it is ours, so that everyone can remember. As well as how to care for them once everyone has found their Egg.” She continued starting to turn to the side to begin the lecture. “OH! That is right, once you find your Egg, bring it to the corner inside the Pen so we can do a check on the Changeling inside to ensure they are healthy.” She finished up turning to her assistant, Mr. Green a tall scary Tamer who was once in a war; I heard he was once a hit man during the war. I do not know what that means but it sounds super scary.</p>
<p>“Now then Mr. Green, the screen if you will?” Miss. Amber asked in her sweet voice. Mr. Green nodded his head once for yes, while calling for his Changeling, a surprisingly adorable little green chameleon named Leon, to transform into a screen to give us pictures to go along with what Miss. Amber is going to go over again.</p>
<p>“Now, as everyone should know a Changeling Egg is very important for young Tamers like yourselves. You will only get one Egg in your life, after all. Now then the rules to picking out your Changeling Egg are as follows:</p>
<p>Rule 1. A Changeling Egg must accept you as its Tamer, it cannot be forced to accept you.</p>
<p>Rule 2. You must follow the pull on your magic to find your Egg. Not pick any Egg that you like just because you think that it looks cool or awesome or whatever nonsense like that.</p>
<p>Rule 3. You may not take another Tamers Changeling Egg or swap your Eggs. If you do so you will have your own Egg removed from your possession and be kicked out of the Academy. As once you gain an Egg that you are pulled to the bond between Tamer and Changeling is already forming and cannot be given to another person, even if the bond is still fragile.” Miss. Amber rattled off, as Leon formed pictures to go along with the three rules Miss. Amber told us.</p>
<p>“Does anyone have any questions about the rules?” Miss. Amber asked, all of us shook our heads no in answer.</p>
<p>“In that case let us move on,” Miss. Amber continued “who can tell me how we know if an Egg is ours?” she asked.</p>
<p>Timidly I raised my hand that was not clutching Moyna, smiling Miss. Amber nodded for me to answer. In my meek voice I answered, “You will know an Egg is yours if the magic inside you pulls you towards the Egg.” I said, my face gradually growing pinker while talking.</p>
<p>“That is correct Siofra-chan, but would you continue the answer?” Miss. Amber asked, smiling kindly towards me.</p>
<p>Blushing deeper in embarrassment I nodded, and gave Moyna a quick squeeze for reassurance, she squeezed my hand back just as tightly while giving me a smile to. I opened my mouth and started out stutteringly, “W-when you find the Egg that pulls at you the most. U-um when you reach out your hand for it, the Egg will send out a spark of its own Flame when you try to reach for it. If the Eggs Flame does not hurt you, but is absorbed into your hand then your body will naturally send out its own Flame as well so as that your Flame can be absorbed into the Egg to complete the start of the bonding. Then you will know that it is yours. If the Egg is not yours the Eggs Flame will hurt you when it tries to be absorbed by you and your body will not produce a flame to form a bond, as the bonding would be unsuccessful.” I said, while compulsively squeezing Moynas hand thought out my mini-speech.</p>
<p>Smiling Miss. Amber nodded “yes that is correct, wonderful job explaining it Siofra-chan.” Miss. Amber said smiling gently at me, then she continued on “Now that we have gone over the rules of finding our Changeling Egg as well as how to know if it is ours, you are ready to enter the Changeling Egg Pen. We will go over how to care for our Egg once everyone has found theirs and we are all back at the classroom.”</p>
<p>Smiling gently at all of us, Miss. Amber stepped out of the way of the door to the Pen, raising her hand she said “know go ahead and find your life long partner, your own personal Changeling. Just remember, like all eggs and babies of any species, a Changeling Eggs is very fragile despite them being very strong and magical. So be careful and do not run around while in the Pen. Okay?” she questioned one last time, her hand now resting on the door to the Pen as she waited for our answer.</p>
<p>Excited and slightly impatient we all chorused out some form of an affirmative answer, while pushing each other slightly in our attempt to get closer to the door and our future partner. At our response and actions Miss. Amber pushed open the door and gave us all one last smile as we rushed past her into the Pen. Passing her and Mr. Green with gleeful happy cheers and giant smiles on our faces as we rushed into find our Changeling Egg and start the two year long process, a very long process for impatient little kids like us, needed for meeting our lifelong partner. Our life long partner who will know us the best of anyone or anything else on this Earth. Well until we are led to find our soul mate, but even then our Changeling will still know us better; as we will have the same shared Flames traveling within us and placed within our souls.</p>

<p>Musician is Dancer (Allen x Reader)</p>
<p>I always knew they meant something. Those dreams I dreamt of the boy made of fire and the one I played with so very long ago. I just never thought I would finally get to meet him and that they would be the same person. Though, where is his red hair and what dared to mar his flesh? When that viridian crystal does so already.</p>
<p>I guess I will just have to find out all about him now and how he has changed since we last met.</p>
<p>I want to see him, the boy made of fire. Lately I have had dreams of this boy.</p>
<p>He has red hair, but it is dirty and blackened from the streets he has to live in. He has silver eyes, which sparkle and glisten, shine and dim like ash and smoke rising from fire. His skin is pale, the color of coals when just before they flake off, but streaked with dirt and filth from the alleys he roams. His voice is fire; soft and warm tempting you to come closer than your mind says you should dare. When you come to close step too far, that is when you hear the inferno hidden within him, feel the flames of violence and hate the street has taught him. It is the sarcasm he wields which crackles and snaps at you making you back away to escape punishment should that fire sneak out of him and mar their unworthy selves. Even his clothes are fire, charred in spots from where they did not escape the fire that burnt down an old orphanage where he pulled them out of, though they still provide protection for him even with their holes.</p>
<p>But the most peculiar thing about him; no I should say the most beautiful thing. He has mismatched arms, like I have mismatched eyes. His right arm is the same as the rest of his skin, pale but streaked with mud and muck. But his left, his left is red. Red like the fire he is made of inside, that comes out in ways that lesser humans do not see. But his left exemplifies him, it is red like fire and scarred as if it was badly burned within that inferno within him, or that inferno seeped out of him for all to see. The nails on this arm are black, black as the coals before they catch fire. But it mars him, this little bit of green on this perfect canvas of fire personified into a boy who grew on these streets. There is a crystal of green on the back of his hand, formed as though it was fused within that fire and the fire lost; it is the only bit of not fire that is in, on, with him. But it is perfect, for it makes the fire that is not and the fire that is him shine and glow all the better.</p>
<p>But the humans do not understand, they see him and fear the fire that they sense under his skin and in his soul. Then see his arm and claim, as ignorant humans so often do that he is cursed, that he is a heathen, that he is a demon, that God has cast his choice and cast him out of heaven. When he is so much more, so much better. I just know it.</p>
<p>Because he is made of fire. And that fire is captivating, it is riveting, enticing, brilliant, hidden, cold, warm, and fevered. He is crackling, sharp, warm appearance, and inferno personality.</p>
<p>When I dream of him on the rare occasion that my mind connects to his, my soul to his, my heart for his. The fire that is and the fire that is not him shines and glows around him.</p>

<p>Somebody has been in my room. I can tell because my reading glasses on the nightstand have been turned. A paper on my desk has a corner off the edge. I don’t do that. Somebody has been here. </p>
<p>I could simply say, oh it must have been my mother, but I’m not. I don’t live with my mother. I came of age recently and that’s an ample situation for someone to sniff me out in itself.</p>
<p>And then there’s the problem with Marcus.</p>
<p>He’s my leader. I follow his orders as does everyone else is our little squad. Thing is, we had a run in with a different squad the other day - unintentionally - and when Marcus approached them to say we meant no harm, they cursed him. Marcus is seriously sick. Not is he all but puking up his stomach and the rest of his intestines, but all her wants to eat are slugs, lizards, and snakes. </p>
<p>That’s nasty all on its own, but since he’s a vampire, he kind of needs to be drinking blood. </p>
<p>He says it’s disgusting. Gags every time blood gets close to his lips.</p>
<p>Amanda, his girlfriend, decided to make him a slug-and-blood smoothie. I’ll just say she had to change her clothes after that. </p>
<p>Anyways, he’s withering away. Blood - especially strong blood - allows vampires to go into the sun unhurt. Amanda opened Marcus’s windows more than a week ago. He screamed and started smoking. Both his eyes turned deep red across the entire eye, even the white part, like all the capillaries in his eyes had burst.Yesterday was the first time he said he could see a color other than red. That color? Pink. </p>
<p>Basically, he’s not getting any better. He’s getting worse. He can’t lead like this.</p>
<p>Why not get another leader? </p>
<p>Ah. Swell plan except we are bound to him for life. So, until he dies, we have no leadership. Offing him won’t work either because being bound to him prevents us from doing anything to harm him. </p>
<p>One time, I tried to throw a knife at his head, but a centimeter behind his head to give him a little scare. I am good with a knife. No way I would have impaled him. And it was dull. When I threw it, I felt a tug in my gut and the knife went straight down like I had dropped it, not thrown it. The knife landed right between my feet. I had been lucky not to have lost a toe. </p>
<p>There’s only one witch whom might possibly be able to heal Marcus and if we don’t get him fixed soon, he could be permanently lamed. We’d be stuck with someone unable to lead until someone from a different clan killed him. But they wouldn’t because that would benefit the rest of us. It would turn us from sitting ducks to wild geese. </p>
<p>I’d be stuck with him for my entire life. Vampires may not age, but werewolves do. Slower than humans, yes, but I still age.</p>
<p>To get to the witch, we’d have to go through our enemy’s territory. I won’t brag and say we are equally matched because we aren’t. The Jackals are much stronger. They are bred for war. They are made for war. My squad was collected and given a home when we lost the one we thought wouldn’t disappear. </p>
<p>I reset the glasses and shift the paper back onto the desk. My question, how did they get in? My room is on the second floor. The enemy couldn’t very well waltz through the kitchen and up the stairs to my bedroom. Even though I had’t been home doesn’t mean the house was empty. </p>
<p>Ella, a wood nymph, inhabits the first floor and communicates with the trees around us. She can’t leave and will sure as hell wreak havoc on anyone who walks through her territory uninvited. </p>
<p>The first floor, second floor, and the nearby forest are too much for Ella to handle on her own, so Marcus has her not watch the second floor. Says anyone who goes up to the second floor has to go through the first floor too. </p>
<p>Apparently Marcus is wrong. When certain breeds of vampires can fly and we have a balcony running all the way around the house, Marcus’s logic is flawed.</p>
<p>I walk to the door leading out to the balcony and find it unlocked. Definitely a vampire infestation. Worse than ants.</p>
<p>Marcus being in need of help and me coming of age must have been enough of an incentive to convince the Jackals to send someone over to sniff me out. My entire room feels unnaturally tainted by enemy vampires. I swear, if I find one drop of blood anywhere, I’ll find who drank in my room and spill <em>their</em> blood on <em>their </em>carpet to see how they like it. </p>

Will would rather backpack through Europe, getting lost in its alleyways and staying alone, while Ella would prefer to stay home and take care of her beloved, dying grandmother.

Amidst famous masterpieces and breathtaking wonders, they must confront their own demons while figuring out what, exactly, they want out of life-- and each other. </p>

<p>The murmurs die down and the man smiles again, pleased at the quick response. “Welcome to London!” He booms. His voice, although seemingly American, has a twinge of an accent that Ella can’t place. It’s not quite German, not quite Swedish, not quite French. “As you have probably guessed, I will be acting as your guide through this journey.” The man pauses here, shifts on his feet a little. <br/><br/>“The title of ‘guide’ is an interesting one, I think. Its origins are from the Germanic and Old French terms ‘guider’ and has been found in print for hundreds of years. It can also mean to lead, to shepherd, escort and advise. All of these things—yes, even the shepherding—I intend to do for you.<br/><br/>“For many of you, at least according to those lovely surveys you filled out while registering for this tour, this is your first time outside of the country you were born. I congratulate you on your courage, initiative, and sense of adventure. Leaving your home and coming somewhere you’ve never been before can be an intimidating experience. Traveling, although I wish it was, is not for everyone. For some of you, this experience may be the gateway to further travels. For others, it may be confirmation that there really is no place like home. Regardless, my goal is to make sure you have the best experience possible. My job is to guide you—not just through museums, churches, and cultural faux paus’, but as a journey. <br/><br/>“Traveling is not for the feint of heart. We will be doing a lot of walking, a lot of actual traveling, whether it’s by planes, trains, or automobiles. You will be hungry. You will be tired. You may be too cold—or when we get to Italy—too hot. There will be times when you’re so grouchy you wished you wouldn’t have gotten out of bed that morning. In times like those, I encourage you to have some perspective. I’ll give you some advice that someone once gave me: ninety-five percent of your troubles on this trip can be cured by two things: a sandwich and a nap. Take one or take both and I guarantee you’ll feel ten times better.”<br/><br/>He takes a breath, before grinning widely at the stunned faces before him. “But why am I telling you all of this, do you ask? I’m not trying to use scare tactics, if that’s what you’re asking. But traveling is more mentally grueling than physical, and I want everyone to be prepared. To understand that something of this great of risk and magnitude will take some sacrifice. This isn’t a trip to Hawaii. There won’t be sleeping in most days. You won’t lay out by the pool and read a book. <br/><br/>“But this is what you will be doing. You’re going to stare up at Big Ben and hear it chime. You’re going to watch the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace and drink a pint at a British pub. You’re going to cross the Tower Bridge on your own two feet, as millions of Londoners before you have done. You’re going to climb to the top of Montmartre and eat a crepe and contemplate art. You’re going to see Paris from the top of the Eiffel Tower and fight your way through masses of tourists to see the Mona Lisa up close. You’re going to see the fine curls on David’s head. You’re going to see the grief on Mary’s face in St. Peter’s and you’re going to stare at the Sistine Chapel and contemplate your own existence. You’re going to see the Roman Forum and the moonrise over the Coliseum. And if you’re lucky, you’re going to be at the Pantheon when it rains so you can catch raindrops on your tongue as they fall from the oculus.<br/><br/>“You’re going to make mistakes—cultural ones, big ones, small ones. You’re going to feel awkward and flustered and bewildered and frustrated. But you’re also going to have your breath taken away. You’re going to understand what it means to be so small in this world, to feel insignificant, and yet feel so grand, so lucky that you get to be a part of it at all. That you get to see the creations and accomplishments of others. To partake in their joy, in what they have gifted the world. You’re going to contemplate life and death and the after life and rebirth. <br/><br/>“So maybe this does sound scary, but I don’t mean to scare you. And I’m sorry if I’ve rambled on for what probably seems like far too long. As you can see, I’m very passionate about traveling. Traveling is an education in itself, one that everyone should have the opportunity to experience. Like I said before, I know it isn’t for everyone, so even if I can’t convince everyone to love traveling as much as I do, then I hope, if anything you can learn something from it. My name is Bert Balfour, everyone, and I am your tour guide. Welcome to Robert Louis Stevenson Tours and I can’t wait to partake in this journey with you.” <br/></p>

<p><em>     American Meadow</em> is the modern account of Iris Marie-Jeanne Carstensen, an enraptured devout within The New Chapel of the Meadow ...<br/>     It is the tale wherein she endures under rafters echoing with the gospel desecration of the human soul by the feral spirit of the cult. It is therein she endures the cannibalism of innocence by man's necrophiliac inclinations ...<br/>     And it is thus how we find that isolate hamlet - that christened community of Barley Meadow nestled away within a Heartland valley. It is thus a flowering attempt at Eden established upon the sin of genocides beckoning from decades passed. And thus is a tale predicated by those wars which were once sanctioned as manifestations of destiny. Thus it is that crimes against humanity are sun-bleached from the palimpsest of collective consciousness just as blood and bodies were drawn and hidden beneath prairie flowers ... <br/>     And it is there we find that all is unforgotten in the forgotten children of that plague rendered by those self-consumed pioneers, those deathly reapers. This is a ceremony of the devout, the divine, the wicked, the dead, the gone, and the lost - an ouroboros dance of infernal destruction which only few of this Holy Mass can escape.<br/><em>     American Meadow</em> is thus the story of impotent martyrdom in the quest for redemption, the realized shadow wrath of decimated peoples, and mankind's malevolent worship-defiance of the yawning void that consumes us all in the end. This is the breaking open of Hell, the venture within, and all that conspires in the aftermath. <br/>     This is the realization that more than flowers bloom within the meadow. <br/>     Abandon hope. </p>

<p>NOTE: Rokugan is the fictional setting of the role-playing Legend of the Five Rings, published by AEG. While most of the characters in my story are my creation, some belong to AEG, as does the entirety of the world. It's their sandbox; I'm just playing in it.<br/><br/>In the land of Rokugan, spellcasters are few and far between. These spellcasters, called shugenja, spend their lives training in the ways of the kami, the elemental spirits that make up the fabric of world of Rokugan. Saki was born to a duelist of the Kakita family, and it was expected that she would follow in her father's footsteps and take up the sword. But on the day of her graduation, she learns that she is, in fact, a shugenja, and not meant to follow the path of the sword at all. She embarks on a journey from her home in Kyuden Kakita to the Temple of Shining Light, home of the shugenja of her clan, to unlearn the way of the sword and to try to learn the way of the kami. Along the way she encounters an albino duelist, a Mantis pirate out to destroy her, and a secret large enough to threaten the entire empire.</p>

<p>Samantha Grant adored her Northwest mountain B&amp;B and even though she was struggling to maintain it, she'd work her fingers to the bone before asking for help.</p>
<p>When she finds out her grandmother sold the property 3 weeks prior, Samantha frantically does everything she can to find the new owner.</p>
<p>Little does she know, he's been staying in her guest room for the past couple of days, getting under her skin and making his way into her heart.</p>
<p>Will she find out too late that he's her enemy or will the temptation be too much for her to handle?</p>

<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>                A joke.  A cruel, vicious joke.</p>
<p>                That was the only logical explanation.  Samantha Grant stared down at the stack of papers the courier had thrust into her unsteady hand.  Shadow Mountain Bed &amp; Breakfast had been sold a month ago? </p>
<p>                Impossible.</p>
<p>                A multitude of memories flitted through her mind in a matter of seconds as she looked up and glanced around the glowing room.</p>
<p>                Shadow Mountain was one of the oldest ski and retreat resorts in Washington, however, it was also the smallest and most exclusive.  Mt. Baker and Snoqualmie dwarfed it in size, but Shadow B&amp;B held it’s own as one of the most prestigious spots in the Northwest.  And until three weeks ago, it had been her grandmother’s pride and joy.  After her passing, Sam had taken over the preparations for getting the B&amp;B ready for the new season.</p>
<p>                Throwing herself into the upgrades helped her force the tragic accident she’d lost her fiancé to almost a year ago to the recesses of her mind.  Trystan was always there, cheering her progress and keeping her faint smile from vanishing completely.</p>
<p>                But he was never far from her thoughts.</p>
<p>                Although these past two weeks had definitely attempted to make her forget him completely.  If something could possibly go wrong, it had.  She’d already pushed back the winter opening by a month and at this rate, she’d be lucky if they’d be open at all this season.</p>
<p>                With a constant two year waiting list, calming her frustrated, expectant patrons hadn’t been an easy task.  But there wasn’t much she could do about the decision to delay or cancel on them.</p>
<p>                Three days ago, all of Hades demons had appeared; the heater had stopped working, the chimney had literally caught on fire and the phone lines had gone down in a freak, unexpected windstorm.  All of this coincided with her renovation of the main bathroom, making the entire house seem as though it was in the middle of a demolition derby.</p>
<p>                If all that hadn’t threatened to break her, the pipe under the kitchen sink had burst moments before the doorbell had interrupted.  And now…</p>
<p>                Sold?</p>
<p><em>                Oh, Trystan, what do I do?</em></p>
<p>                Confusion muddled her thoughts as she focused again on the offending paperwork to peruse for any indication something wasn’t right.  Icy fingers gripped her in anger as the letter explained that her grandmother, Deitra Fanning had sold the resort to Grayson Industries with a handful of stipulations.  All of which, Sam assumed were listed throughout the bulk of the stack she still held in her shaking hand.</p>
<p>                At age 87, Dietra, sound as she may have been, couldn’t possibly have known what she was doing selling off the land her own great grandfather had purchased at the turn of the century.  Someone had taken advantage of her, there was no doubt in Sam’s mind. </p>
<p>                Sam set the envelope onto the granite countertop, unable to recall walking into the kitchen.  She placed a cool hand against her clammy forehead, feeling her heart pick up speed, she realized her blood pressure may be taking a hit.</p>
<p><em>                Don’t forget to eat…</em></p>
<p>                Trystan’s voice rang in her head, reminding her as he always did that her hypoglycemic level was dangerously low. </p>
<p>                The health issue had arisen within a year of them meeting, and had only been serious three times during their relationship.  But Trystan had never downplayed the severity of it.  And though Sam knew it could be a matter of life and death, she couldn’t help smile when it started to hit her and she heard his honeyed voice again.</p>
<p>                A loud knock against her front door caused Samantha to jerk around in surprise.  <em>Now what</em>?  She debated answering it this time.  She couldn’t handle any more bad news today.  Still grasping the cover letter, she calculated her chances. </p>
<p>                Knowing her curiosity wouldn’t allow for ignorance, Sam strode to the door and yanked it open, her eyes meeting the warmest brown eyes she’d ever seen.  The color like melted, dark chocolate oozed down her frame and neutralized the rage that had begun building moments ago.</p>
<p>                “I’m looking for Ms. Grant?”  The velvety request washed over her, causing the dizziness fogging her mind to grow exponentially. </p>
<p>                Sam reached out to grasp the door frame as subtly as she could, knowing she needed to eat soon.</p>
<p>                “Are you okay?  You don’t look so hot.”  The stranger’s brow knitted together.  It was the last thing she remembered before her world abruptly twisted and she collapsed.</p>

<p>I am not sure why I am looking in these books. I usually don't read randomly through crochet pattern books when I don't have a project to work on. I guess I could make some gloves for my cousin... she wanted a pair when I made one last year. Maybe a lacy kind. But it snows in New York in the winter so maybe a woolen pair would be better. <br/> <br/>	I look down the street. It is very quiet today but every time a car drives by I look up because I am nervous. What if they don't come down the same route today, I think. I just shake my head. I have spent months making sure I would know every route they take and they never don't pass this point. My finger itches for the button, I love explosives but these are more for fear than for looks. This is not going to be impressive.. but it will stop them. <br/> <br/>	I keep flipping through the books. I think I have some cotton yarn that might work but maybe the wool in the garage would be better. Or maybe the cotton with a lacy pattern. I make a pile of the books with possible patterns. I check my pager again. No messages. That is good. Milly shouldn't have anything to report, I don't like changing my plans. I notice a movement in the shadows. The boys better stay hidden. A mistake will not be tolerated. It is never tolerated, and I know that they know this. Too many deaths already. <br/> <br/>	A car screeches around the corner.. that might make a problem. They are swerving and all over the place. I sigh. I should let Milly know that trouble is coming. My rifle is over on the bookcase, maybe four steps away. I should move closer in case I need to take someone out. I hope not. I will text Milly about it... or just keep flipping through the books. </p>

<p><b>The Legend of Gideon Flynn</b><br/><br/>This is a story that parents in Hael Malstrom tell to frighten disobedient children.<br/><br/>Once, in times long past, when dragons were still common and the Great Fault was young and the Valdenemus redwood was<br/>only a sapling on a bare hill, a pack of mercenaries and treacherous guards massacred a king and all his family: his wife, his children, even his grandchildren. Only one person of the king’s household escaped alive—a young man named Gideon Flynn, the youngest prince of the royal family.<br/><br/>Gideon loved his father. He loved his mother, his brothers and sisters, his nieces and his nephews. He claimed his father’s throne with a heavy heart, and he did not wait long before he plotted revenge against those responsible for his family’s murder. And because he could not be sure which of his nobles were ultimately responsible, he had them all killed.<br/><br/>But it wasn’t enough. Revenge, he thought, was supposed to satisfy. He felt nothing.<br/><br/>He began to pursue the men who might have been indirectly involved, spending the contents of his treasury freely. He put his<br/>father’s enemies on sharpened spikes first, then their servants. When Gideon’s friends spoke against him, he turned on them<br/>with the blind zealotry of a man who had lost everything. It was only a matter of time before the nation rebelled against their mad<br/>king.<br/><br/>When opposing armies marched down the capital’s streets, when he found himself trapped in his palace with nowhere to<br/>run, Gideon turned to the only thing he still believed in. He threw himself from his highest tower and smashed on the ground<br/>below.<br/><br/>That should have been the end of the story. But it wasn’t.<br/><br/>When Death came to Gideon Flynn, it told him that his hands were stained by the pain and blood of his people, that it<br/>had no interest in collecting his soul. It cursed him with healing and eternal youth, and the broken king who had wished for death<br/>became immortal.<br/><br/>It has been thousands of years since the fall of Gideon Flynn. The country Hael Malstrom has risen and fallen many times,<br/>under many names. A new line rules now—the peaceful Torlo family, who have discarded the office of king in favor of the<br/>more ambiguous ‘Grand Meister’. The dragons are nearly gone, the Great Fault is old, and the ancient redwood dominates the<br/>capital city Valdenemus. But they say that when terrible things happen to good people that Gideon’s shadow has fallen upon<br/>them. He is the cause of droughts and calamity, and his existence is a darkness that lingers on his former subjects to this day.<br/><br/>And though no one has seen Gideon Flynn for thousands of years, they know he isn’t gone</p>

<p>Uriel Collins knows that he is a resurrected man. He knows that he was once a villain by the name of Isaac, though he does not remember anything prior to his violent death. He's going to Mileston anyway, to seek out whatever remains of the life he inherited from Isaac. It's so hard, not having a past. Everyone needs to start somewhere.<br/><br/>There are some sins so black that even a monster couldn't possibly ignore them. When Uriel decides to dig up the crimes of Isaac Collins, both the living and the murdered have plenty they want to say. Some speak in riddles. Some speak with guns.<br/><br/>______________________________________<br/><strong>Our Intrepid Cast</strong><br/><ul><li><strong>Uriel Collins</strong> - The resurrected corpse. Uriel doesn't remember his past life as Isaac Collins, but he has a pretty good idea that he was a villain-- a gangster and a murderer and worse besides. He just came to Mileston looking for treasure. Some property, some money... why did he have to find bodies instead?</li><br/> <li><strong>Edmond Varrice</strong> - Once, Varrice was a young police officer, one who saw too many things too soon in the line of duty. He began his unofficial investigation on Isaac Collins well before he ever became a detective. Ten years later, Varrice has no case against Collins. It doesn't matter anyway; the villain he was chasing is long dead. Or... is he?</li><br/> <li><strong>Thomas Dalence</strong> - After Tom's father coughed himself to death, his mother vanished and their apartment was reclaimed by the landlord. He lives on a madman's roof now, under the big overhanging eaves where the rain doesn't usually reach. He has a stray cat for a friend, the best view in the city, and a collection of pretty rocks he found in a false brick. And he has to survive the winter. </li><br/> <li><strong>Mendel Berkish</strong> - Mendel's life hasn't gone the way he had wanted. Ten years ago he was on top of the world. Ten years ago anyone who gave him trouble would have met Isaac and be declared a suicide when they were found. Or at least, that's the way Mendel remembers it. He's never had a bigger disappointment than seeing dead Collins again, rushing up to him, ecstatic... only to find that this red-eyed giant isn't Isaac at all. It's just Isaac's body, Isaac's talents, Isaac's strengths... but without the memory, he isn't, he can't be Isaac.<br/><br/>Obviously, he needs to jog Uriel's memory. Return the memory, resurrect the man. He'd do anything. Those were the glory days... right?</li><li><strong>Nathan Imerson</strong> - The current 'king' of the Southside Slums. Before Isaac Collins died, Imerson helped him steal a collection of priceless jewels, which Collins stole from the gang and hid privately. He took the location to his treasure to his grave ten years ago, and it's been out of Imerson's reach ever since. Mister Imerson would like to change that. He's not much interested in seeing his old rival walk away alive after the fact, though.</li><br/> <li><strong>Old Missus Bones</strong> - They call the inventors that specialize in plants and chemicals and genetic engineering 'bio-junkies' in the empire. Missus Bones would laugh at that; she's just a harmless old widow. But she'll take your corpses off your hands, for a price. She must feed her darling plants, the poor dears. And should you come across something interesting, she'd be happy to hear all about it.</li><br/></ul></p>

<p>Most grave robbers take the jewelry. This one stole the body.<br/><br/>On a tour of a mechanist’s laboratories-- her brother’s workplace-- Merrily Soarin wanders off, peeks into an ajar door, and discovers a boy in a glass tube. Just before Merrily is caught, she could have sworn that he looked at her. As if he were still alive.<br/><br/>Enter master artificer Maxwell Gallows, once famous, now infamous. He’s been looking for his son’s corpse for a long time, and meeting Merrily Soarin was the best thing that had yet happened in his search. But there are a few problems.<br/><br/>One: Maxwell Gallows would rather kill Merrily than repay her for her help.<br/><br/>Two: Resurrection is illegal, and protocol dictates that the recipient be destroyed.<br/><br/>Three: Leo, the artificer’s son, is so damaged that his next death will be his last no matter how brilliant his father.<br/><br/>Four: In an attempt to steal some of Maxwell’s old projects, the grave robber accidentally activated one.</p>

<p>At the very end, newer than any other grave, a stone mausoleum dominated over the rest. Maxwell wove through other plots to reach it directly. It had once had an angel carved into the front of the stone. Maxwell himself had chipped its head off years ago. Now only the spread wings and Maxwell's surname remained: GALLOWS stood out in beveled letters.<br/><br/>Maxwell fit the key in the lock and opened the door. He descended a short flight of stairs, flicked on a large brass switch. The tomb filled with light, which flickered and hummed like volley of trapped bees. Maxwell passed his wife's grave without a side glance. His goal lay at the end of the vault.<br/><br/>He removed a false stone in the wall which protected a hidden keyhole. He fit the key in the lock, and cracked his knuckles. A sophisticated panel of gauges and switches slid out from the wall. A clear bulb blinked steadily within. It made Maxwell smile. ""Well, that's gone right,"" he said. ""Uriel! My tools!""<br/><br/>Uriel entered with Maxwell's cracked leather bag in hand, which he brought directly to his master. Maxwell opened the bag at once and began to root through its contents.<br/><br/>And though Uriel, being a very tall man, did not appreciate the mausoleum's low ceiling, his stooped head put him at a very good angle to observe what Maxwell had missed. Resting upon Missus Emily Gallows' sarcophagus was something that absolutely did not, would not ever belong: a fancy gentleman's curved pipe, carved from rosewood and what looked very much like ivory. Maxwell had many vices. A love of leaf was not among them.<br/><br/>A dedicated servant would have called out. A dedicated creation would inform its master of this discovery, a presence that did not belong, a sign of meddling, tampering, here amid Maxwell's greatest work, his most fiercely guarded treasure. Uriel did neither.<br/><br/>He would obey any order his master asked of him.<br/><br/>He would not volunteer.<br/><br/>The pipe disappeared into the pocket of his only trousers.<br/><br/>Uriel left the mausoleum to set up Maxwell's machinery-- machines to control the thawing process, machines to generate electricity, pre-built parts to replace the broken pieces of Maxwell Gallows' only son. Machines to restore the preserved dead.<br/><br/>Maxwell's hands shook in anticipation, and flicked his switches, shifted his dials with the mind of a scientist and the hands of an artist, white gloves worn gray easing dials with minute precision. He called for the thawing device first. His hazel eyes gleamed with excitement, and he offered Uriel a toothy, boyish grin as he showed his progress. Machines were installed, numbers were monitored.<br/><br/>""Open the sarcophagus,"" Maxwell said at last.<br/><br/>Uriel gripped the heavy stone slab with both hands and drew it from its place, the work of four or six men. He set it gently aside. Maxwell gripped the sides and peered within.<br/><br/>The cryo-chamber was made of semi-matte metal, the cold covering the surface with a feathery frost. Wafts of cold steam rose up as small amounts of liquid nitrogen evaporated as the temperature readjusted.<br/><br/>""Start the thaw,"" Maxwell said. ""Open the case.""<br/><br/>Flesh would not do in such extreme temperatures. Uriel twisted his left hand until it cracked and clicked, then pulled. Flesh parted along a brass seam just below his wrist. Uriel put the fabricated hand away and pulled a new one over it, a metal claw that would not be harmed by intense cold. He tripped each latch, every lock and catch, and pulled the handle. The lid eased open before Maxwell's eager eyes.<br/><br/>The casket opened with the hiss of normalizing pressure. The chemical fog cleared. Maxwell’s eyes stopped shining.<br/><br/>Leo Gallows' body was gone.</p>

<p>Rylan was sent with Dacha for a second time into the bowels of the Pit with another letter, and more packages. Their guide was not happy to see them.<br/><br/>""You nearly got me skinned,"" he growled at Rylan the moment he stepped into his cave. ""Skinned, your magniloquence! Roasted alongside dinner on that spit, passed out to get chewed on a by a hundred toothless mouths for bringing in royalty!""<br/><br/>""I'm not royalty,"" Rylan replied, though the reaction didn't entirely surprise him.<br/><br/>""As good as, unless you faked that fancy jewelry. Damn it to a glowing river, you're not what I had in mind! You're not what they had in mind, and we ought to gut you for leading us into this!"" The man stomped his boot into the stone floor, but in his infinite wisdom didn't pull out a weapon. Dacha was watching him very intently. He calmed down after a moment to continue, ""But they want to see you again, so I guess I've got no choice, do I? But I'm not taking you both. The slave can come. Not the woman.""<br/><br/>""You'd leave a lady behind to navigate the Pit alone?"" Rylan asked, narrowing his eyes.<br/><br/>""Boy, unless I've missed my guess, that's no lady.""<br/><br/>Rylan decided not to point out that he'd just gone from 'your magniloquence' to 'boy'. Dacha responded instead. ""Sure I am. I've got the teats to prove it."" Rylan internally groaned. Trust Dacha to resort to tactlessness as a first defense.<br/><br/>""That... wasn't what I meant. Why do you even play at being human, you're not even armed, are you?"" he insisted.<br/><br/>""Sweetheart, I don't need weapons. I have the power of fat. All I have to do is sit on you and fart. You won't be getting up again after that, I promise you."" And her eyes crinkled, hinting at an amused grin beneath her muffler.<br/><br/>""Did Barrynch specifically ask you to leave her behind?"" Rylan interjected, before their guide found a response for that. His head was filled with some very potent mental imagery now that he wished hadn't found its way into his mind's eye.<br/><br/>There was a pause. ""No,"" he replied, sullenly.<br/><br/>""Then please. Take us to Barrynch. The faster we can get there, the faster we can leave you be.""</p>

The Rulers claimed it was for the safety of every inhabitant, and those who ventured into the waters, thinking to explore, were never heard from again.  Everyone was monitored for their protection, no one went without food or clean water, and violent crime statistics were practically non-existent.

The town proves to be an ideal host to the NEILA’s secrets and the origins of the technology that NEILA produces. But as NEILA grows, their secrets become harder to keep from the world, and as pressure mounts, infighting threatens to jeopardize their successful interplanetary partnership. Eventually the debate between right and wrong becomes less defined and the question arises whether monetary success has been blinding to the bigger question: is humanity really ready to greet other worlds?</p>

<p>When I died, the world did not go blank.</p>
<p>The world did not slowly fade; darkness did not swallow me.</p>
<p>When I died, it was like all my hatred and sadness engulfed me. My last dying curse slipped from my lips, escaping the void I was falling into, tethering me to the world. Left behind was all the joy and love from my previous life, as I entered a new one.</p>
<p>The anger tethered me to my grave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What have I done?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>...Tendrils of smoke began to curl out from the ground, forming a woman. The smoke formed a human girl, who looked perfectly solid, but with the colors faded, like a picture washed out from being in the sun for too long.</p>
<p>“I’m Addie May. I had forgotten,” the girl said. “Thank you for waking me up, I had been asleep for far too long.”</p>
<p>We just stared at her. Meredith grinned.</p>
<p>Addie May did not smile, she just looked at her. “Do you know where my former fiancé is?”</p>
<p>“Are you a ghost?” Oliver blurted out.</p>
<p>“I suppose so. I’m not really sure. All I know is I was dying, and then I was here, alone, until you called me. I was so lonely. And angry. I still am. My fiancé… you have to tell me where he is!”</p>
<p>“We didn’t mean to call you, Oliver did by accident. And we don’t know who your fiancé is!” I said.</p>
<p>Addie’s face twisted. “WHERE IS HE?!”</p>
<p>“We don’t know!” Oliver said beseechingly.</p>
<p>Addie fell, clutching her gravestone, and began to cry. “I do not remember his name. Why do I not remember his name? I can’t seem to remember anything, and yet my blood boils with anger.”</p>
<p>The girl cried, her long dark hair falling over her face. She was gorgeous, with red lips and bright eyes with long dark lashes, and she wore an old-fashioned red dress patterned with roses and dainty matching slippers. The colors were blown out, except for the darkness of her hair, which was the deepest black I had ever seen.</p>
<p>Meredith walked slowly to the girl and touched her shoulder gently. “We’ll find him for you. What can you remember?”</p>
<p>“He was only of average height, but he was young and handsome. And yet he left me for my maidservant.""</p>
<p>Meredith frowned. “Why would you want to find him again if he hurt you?!”</p>
<p>Addie May looked up at her. “Because I loved him. I need to see if he still lives, if he changed his mind.”</p>
<p>“Why did he leave you?”</p>
<p>“She was poor, plain but for her red hair, and yet he loved her more than anything, more than me…”</p>

<p>My name is Stella Rose, and I am a dork.</p>
<p>Nerd. Geek. Whatever you would call me. Why? Well, I wear glasses and preppy clothes, and get straight A's. I wear my hair in a bun and belong to the school Book Club. I can usually be found at the library, inhaling novel after sweet novel. My nickname is Hermione Granger. </p>
<p>But... I have a few... secrets, you might call them. </p>
<p>I mean, they aren't really secrets. But I suppose they make me less of a geek than I already am. I have a tattoo on my hand of the Deathly Hallows (I'm 16, and I had permission, that great GPA was for a reason, okay?). Also, I have a good sense of style, what with my adorably schoolgirl-style outfits and nose piercing. I share many fandoms with other nerds, like Doctor Who, Harry Potter, My Little Pony, and various anime. </p>

<p> Caroline remembered her and her husband's high school reunion- which was actually where they met for what felt like the first time after dating in Santa Monri High School. After the class of 2009 graduated, everyone parted to their own universities and worked on attaining their career goals. Caroline was in Nevada. He was in New York. When they met, she could feel her stomach jumping up and down for something to say, but couldn't. After an eternity of Skype calls, texts, and other forms of communicative social media, it was almost weird to talk face-to-face to him in real life. It was totally different than their video Skype sessions.</p>
<p>He was much more handsome than what he looked like on her computer screen. His smile was brighter than the dark school gym. His formalwear fit perfectly around his lean body. And she couldn't forget the feeling of his hands when he enveloped hers in them. Warm, callused- just <em>warm.</em></p>
<p>He immediately swept her up into a heated kiss full of ugly crying (her) and ugly laughter (him) . To everyone, it all looked, well, pretty ugly.</p>
<p>After he dried her tear-streaked face with a multitude of tissues, they stuck together throughout the whole dance. They were practically glued to each other and only made small talk with some of their friends from high school. The only thing that she focused on- and she was sure he was too- was him and him to her. How could she ever forget that reunion?</p>
<p>Then there was the wedding, which immediately took place after being engaged for who knows how long? The wedding was a much joyous occasion. She was dressed in a rather exaggerated dress, strapless and pronouncing her bosom, countless dove petals layered and layered upon each other until they spilled across the floor, the entirety of it resembling a white bell below Caroline's waist.</p>
<p>Caroline could never forget the day she walked down the aisle, his family on her left and hers on her right. Both families had turned to look at the bride and she embedded their looks of awe into her mind. She must have been quite a sight. But the only thing she really focused her sights on was him, standing at the very end with his signature grin.</p>
<p>She could already recall the sequence of feelings that followed each other as she walked down the aisle, her father congratulating and praising her 'choice of men'. How her throat swelled up as she closed the distance between her and her husband. Her cheeks gradually warming up until they were practically scorching. When her hands began to sweat and her veil had swathed her in persistent waves of heat.</p>
<p>She felt the sparks electrify through all her fingers when his hand touches hers, both of them exchanging rings and vows. And when they finally kissed, fireworks exploded about wildly in her mind. She still couldn't believe that she was married to her high school sweetheart.</p>
<p>Their wedding night was a whole 'nother thing. Caroline was so foreign to everything. He was experienced- much to her dismay- but he was all hers now. And she was all his. There was nothing she needed to worry about that night.</p>
<p>The only worrisome part was how she could go through the pregnancy. It scared her at first, of course. Most of her friends have already born their own child. They all said it went perfectly well. Yet, Caroline kept examining the possible defects. Anything could happen.</p>
<p>But at least her husband was so reassuring throughout the entire process. She deeply appreciated the doting and how much he spoiled her for the past few months. Not surprisingly, she was starting to get used to this.</p>
<p>The ultrasound was the most exciting thing yet. The second Caroline's eyes landed on the black frame of her baby sleeping soundly inside her stomach, it was exhilarating. Out of this planet. Everything was actually going well. She was going to have a baby.</p>

<p>Lambdadelta soon arrived, oblivious to the seething aura surrounding Louyan. She plopped on a chair, her skirt flying up at an embarrassing length. Crossing her legs, Featherine scoffed with disapproval and blew small rings of smoke from her fair lips. Bernkastel crinkled her nose, preferring to drink the musky scent of her black tea rather than the thick smoke lingering fom her left. Louyan to the right, however, was blank as an empty page. Not reacting to anything, it seems.<br/><br/>Beatrice, to everyone's surprise (Featherine's, not exactly) arrived in a swirling tornado of her usual glowing insects. Holding a pipe similar to Featherine's, she smoothed her tight braided bun and sat awkwardly between Lambdadelta and Louyan. The tea party would soon be complete when other witches arrive. Only Ange, Battler, Erika, Eva, and Virgilia were left to be waited.<br/><br/>The servants appeared unnoticed in the background, glove to the heart. Belphegor glanced sorrowfully down at Louyan, who didn't seem to sense her presence from behind. The obvious regret on Asmodeus's face was sure to be noticed alright, blessing both Louyan and Taran with a life of romance. She surely didn't intend for the result to be something like this. It was inevitable.<br/><br/>A fragile tea set materialized on the small table in the center, snickers and ominous chuckles were exchanged between Beatrice and Lambdadelta, Bernkastel blankly surveyed her settings, while Featherine was busy spinning a piece of fragment between her fingers. A different game where she will soon accompany another like Louyan with her presence.<br/><br/>Louyan, however, was staring at her shaking palms. Where they once intertwined with Taran's; wherever he was right now. To live forever with this regret pulling her strings, with no parents to care for her; a Hell she chose by her own choice. Nonetheless, the highlighted word of the day was regret.<br/><br/>The Siesta sisters, twitched their bunny ears and had anticipated a conversation with the Seven Stakes of Purgatpry, violent topics being rose to an abnormal level. Their squeaky voices toned down when Eva entered the room, a smug grin changing her soft features. Taking place next to Featherine, she reached across for Louyan and tugged on her arm, gently smiling.<br/><br/>“So how did it go?” Eva asked, her eyes shining like gems.<br/><br/>Louyan muttered, turning away. “I want to go back.”<br/><br/>“Well, too late for that!” Not bothering to even comfort her, she laid back casually against her seat and accepted Bern's offer for Oologn tea. Her obsession with tea sightly disgusted Eva, but she knew better than to decline against the most cruelest; most brutal and powerful witch in the universe. Something small such as this would itch Bernkastel so irritatedly that she'd explode at the most unexpected moment. Eva is much smarter than that to deal with that kind of nuisance.<br/><br/>Beatrice impatiently tapped her heel on the marble floor, waiting with exasperation for her husband Battler to arrive. When the hell will he walk through that portal? Damn it, Ange is delaying the young man! But they were in a sibling situation that needn't be interrupted by a whining witch. She needed to keep her appearance subtle and stoic as possible. So far, it didn't work.<br/><br/>She glanced at her young successors, Eva-Beatrice and Louyan-Beatrice. No one knew Beatrice's actual name, the mystery satisfying her quite nicely. Virgilia, her past teacher, once went by the same title, but later changed her name to something unique; Virgilia. Not her real name, and it keeps Beatrice on the edge. That's one trait she and her teacher shared.<br/>“When will the other idiots arri –,” Lambdadelta started, interrupted by Erika's sudden presence. She cleared her throat and casually laid back as if she never said anything.<br/><br/>Erika smirked. “You were saying, my rival?”<br/><br/>“No need to emphasize it dear.”<br/><br/>The two were 'rivals', as demanded by Erika. Being Bernkastel's lover, Lambdadelta has earned Erika's seething jealousy and the two had bickered ever since. Hell, Bernkastel and Lambdadelta were enemies before. Their last resort to love baffled everyone for quite a bit. Hell's newspaper stated all the facts; of course, some lies slithered in as no one was perfect in this realm.<br/><br/>“What's she doing here?” Erika jabbed a finger at Louyan's direction.<br/><br/>Beatrice narrowed her eyes. “Please, take a seat.”<br/><br/>Erika glared straight back. “I'm not taking any orde –.”<br/><br/>“You will take a seat, wench.” Bernkastel bellowed, so silently it quieted the room. Erika huffed and knelt down beside her feet like the faithful servant she was and kissed the tips of Bernkastel's mary janes. Crinkling her nose with clear distaste, Lambdadelta clapped excitedly as Battler entered the room. Ange didn't appear by his side as Beatrice expected. Where is she?<br/><br/>Featherine welcomed him with a gentle smile, Eva sticking her tongue out, Erika glaring as if the hatred would be enough to drill a hole in his forehead, Bernkastel and Lambdadelta stood up and made an unexpected dance for Battler's entrance, Beatrice grinnd cheekily and pecked his cheek; Louyan staring hauntingly at her murderer's doppleganger. Twin? Who cares. He killed her. Just ignore him.<br/><br/>Battler frowned and took place besie Beatrice, appreciating the applause for his entry. Being the Endless Sorcerer, it was a first for these group of witches. With his 'player' personality, Louyan would title him the Hell's Pimp. Ange and Virgilia were the two left remaining. <br/><br/>“Louyan?” It was the first time the real Battler had finally attempted a conversation with the newborn witch, hoping not to be greeted with a sarcastic or hateful remark. <br/><br/>She nodded with acknowledgement. “Battler.”<br/><br/>He didn't expect this mature behavior; thought that's how she mostly acted in his game. Guilt churned in his stomach, and Battler wasn't in the mood for the sour taste to return to his taste buds. Squirming in his seat, Beatrice eyed him with curiosity and concern. Thrusting a teacup in front of him, he accepted it and pecked Beatrice's flushed cheek before sipping Bernkastel's favorite brand.<br/><br/>For some reason, Louyan's heart; if it was still there, was wrung dry the moment Battler's lips grazed Beatrice's cheek. Did she still feel … that when Battler (the evil one) tried to attack her in bed? Well, it didn't matter now that Taran was dead and no longer the boy she knew anymore.</p>

<p><u>February 18, 1878</u></p>
<p> The thunderous echo of approaching horsemen interrupted the leisurely quiet of the canyon. Gunfire erupted behind Middleton and me, so we spun about to see a large posse of Dolan’s men on horseback comin’ at us, guns a’blazin’. Looking ahead, for we were at the back of the travelin’ party, I noted the other three of our group had just gone over the brow of the next hill. They couldn’t see the trouble comin’ our way.</p>
<p>“Hey-ah!” I yelled, slammin’ my heels into my horse’s sides. We raced through the newly fallen snow, past the horses we were movin’ to town, and toward Brewer, Widenmann, and our boss, John Tunstall. We needed to warn them.</p>
<p>Once over the hill, we noted that Widenmann and Brewer were off the trail to the left a ways. Making a split second decision, I rode toward them and Middleton headed to warn Tunstall.</p>
<p>As I rode I heard Middleton shout, “For God’s sake, follow me!”</p>
<p>As I came up on Brewer, Widenmann yelled out, “We can’t hold this place! Let’s ride to the hill over there and make a stand!”</p>
<p>With no time to argue, we rode toward an area covered with tall timber and large boulders, and I assumed Middleton and Tunstall were right behind us. Yet, as Middleton joined us, he was alone.</p>
<p>“Where’s Tunstall?” I said, panic squeezing my chest tight.</p>
<p>John Tunstall was the one they were after. Jimmy Dolan was out for blood ever since John posted that letter in the <em>Mesilla Valley Independent</em>, exposing Dolan and his pals as the real crooks of Lincoln County.</p>
<p>Middleton spoke up. “I yelled for him to follow. He rode in a circle and I motioned him to follow me. As soon as he started toward me I headed here. Maybe he didn’t hear me?”</p>
<p>“Or he didn’t <em>want</em> to hear you,” I clarified, “Damn it, John, you can’t talk your way out of this one!”</p>
<p>“What?” Middleton asked.</p>
<p>“Not you, the <em>other</em> John. We really need to give you a new first name,” I said before looking to Tunstall’s Cattle Foreman, Richard “Dick” Brewer. “Tunstall thinks he can surrender and fight this in court.”</p>
<p>“Dodgasted! They’ll kill him, Will,” Dick replied, his voice strained and his eyes filled with worry.</p>
<p>“Let’s lay down some cover fire and get him outta there!” Rob Widenmann, Tunstall’s best friend, suggested.</p>
<p>Dick’s eyes swiftly scanned the area, which was no more than vast, unsettled land, filled with nothin’ but brush and trees surrounded by mountains covered in snow. We were well hidden, but that caused another problem.</p>
<p>“Will, you’re the smallest. Can you climb?”</p>
<p>I nodded, dismounted, and reluctantly handed the reins to Middleton. I’d have preferred to ride out there and take a shot at them myself, but I understood what Brewer was aimin’ for. Besides, at five-foot-eight and only a hundred and thirty-five pounds, I was the best option for giving us eyes to what was goin’ on the other side of the hill.</p>
<p>Spotting a good tree, I started up. Halfway there, an eerie silence filled my ears like water and a rifle shot echoed off the canyon walls. I came to a halt as dread slammed into my gut.</p>
<p>“Oh, God,” Middleton said, “They’ve killed Tunstall.”</p>
<p>I prayed he was wrong and scaled the tree as fast as I could. Once high enough, the scene before me froze the air in my lungs. John Tunstall, a man I looked up to, lay on the ground next to his horse, not moving, his left cheek buried in the snow.</p>
<p>The group of twenty or so men had now split into three sections. Most were back a few hundred yards while four men rounded up our small herd of horses, leaving just three men on horseback looming over John’s body. I recognized them as Billy “Buck” Morton, Tom Hill, and the dangerous outlaw I used to ride with, Jessie Evans.</p>
<p>Buck Morton’s rifle was still in firing position as Hill dismounted, snatched up Tunstall’s revolver, and fired a bullet into John’s head before killing his horse the same way. He then placed John’s hat on the dead horse’s head and remounted as Morton shouted orders to his men who rounded up our horses.</p>
<p>Eyes wide and jaw clenched, my soul felt cold to the core while my blood was as hot as a smithy’s furnace. Drenched in a need for revenge, I shook with rage, gripping the tree with all my might to keep me from grabbin’ my gun then and there. I was on the brink of losin’ it, when Brewer appeared below me. He wanted answers I didn’t want to give.</p>
<p>Swallowing the pain, I climbed down and gave the news. Widenmann went off his rocker. It took both Brewer and Middleton to stop him from ridin’ out there and gettin’ himself killed.</p>
<p>“There’s too many,” I told him as the other two held him tight. “You know me. I’m the first to jump into the fray, Rob, but now ain’t the time. Not if we want to live to see them bastards pay.”</p>
<p>Since Dolan’s men had moved Tunstall and his horse somewhere none of us saw, we waited for the safety the dark of night provided, and then rode for town. Widenmann had Brewer and Middleton divert to John Newcomb’s farm to get help finding Tunstall’s body while he and I headed straight to Lincoln.</p>
<p>The whole ride I tried not to think on how I’d left John’s dead body lying in the snow somewhere. I may not have had much in common with the twenty-four year old British businessman, but I respected him, and I didn’t think highly of many people.</p>
<p>Since my momma died and my stepfather abandoned me and my brother, I’d not felt a part of anything. On the run and alone, I’d been unable to find where I belonged until John had gotten me out of jail and given me a job. He’d believed in me and given me the family I desperately needed. For that alone, I vowed that anyone involved in his murder would die at my hand.</p>
<p>We arrived in town a little after ten o’clock that night and split again. Widenmann rode to inform Alexander McSween, as he was Tunstall’s lawyer and friend. Not to mention, he was also under attack by the Murphy/Dolan posse. I headed to where news would travel the fastest: Ike Stockton’s Saloon. By midnight, all of Lincoln knew about John, the news traveling like wildfire from town to Fort Stanton and beyond.</p>
<p>By the time I arrived at McSween’s and entered his stable, I found the horses belonging to the rest of my gang already settled for the night. Handing my horse off to be taken care of by one of the servants, I walked toward the patio, which was the term they used for the enclosed, outdoor area between the long sides of the U-shaped home. As I did, I heard shoutin’ and picked up the pace.</p>
<p>With a hand on my gun, I headed toward one of the three adobe walls built to enlarge the patio area; two long and one short, each with an opening at its center. The long ones began at the house, extending both sides of the “U” back toward the Bonito River, while the short wall ran along the riverbed, connecting the other two at their ends. Stepping through the gate of the long, west wall, I saw Henry Brown, and he was as mad as a March hare.</p>
<p>Brown shoved Brewer with all his might, still barely able to move the large man more than a step back. “Where were y’all?” he demanded. When Dick didn’t reply, Henry pulled his gun and pointed it at him. “Tell me!”</p>
<p>Without flinching an inch, Brewer replied, “I suggest you point that thing somewhere else.”</p>
<p>“Or what?” Brown challenged. “You’ll leave me to be killed like ya did John?”</p>
<p>Brown had begun the journey with us that mornin’, but when his horse had thrown a shoe, he’d returned to the Tunstall ranch on the Rio Feliz to get it fixed, thus causing him to not be with us in the canyon when Dolan’s men arrived.</p>
<p>“Henry, it wasn’t like that,” I said, alerting the group to my presence.</p>
<p>“The hell it wasn’t!” he shouted at me without taking his eyes off Brewer.</p>
<p>Widenmann stepped forward. “We didn’t leave him!” he yelled, his voice bouncin’ off the walls of the plaza. Quieting down, he continued. “You really think we’d have just thrown him to the wolves to save our own hides? Damn it!”</p>
<p>“Rob,” Dick started to say, but Widenmann was on a roll.</p>
<p>“After Waite split off to take the wagon on the road, we all kept drivin’ the horses on the trail. Those of us up front ran into some wild turkey. John told us to go catch us a few, sayin’ he’d watch the horses with them two,” he said, indicating Middleton and me.</p>
<p>“Us two?” I exclaimed. “We were at least five-hundred yards behind y’all for godsake. With you and Brewer a few hundred yards to the left of the trail and us that far back, he was a sittin’ duck. Why didn’t he follow us, Dick?” I asked. “They shot him without a gun in his hand, and I know John, he’d have surrendered, thinkin’ he could talk to them about McSween’s debt.”</p>
<p>“We both know darn well that warrant for McSween is bullshit,” Dick interjected.</p>
<p>“Do we?” I countered, keeping my voice down. “He says his fees take up most of what was owed by the life insurance policy, but for all we know, he’s as crooked as a Virginia fence and owes more to Emilie Fritz than he’s sayin’.”</p>
<p>Brewer stared me down, his blue eyes hot with anger. “He might not be the most honest lawyer, but he sure as hell didn’t embezzle ten-thousand dollars from that woman. It’s just a ruse by Murphy and Dolan to remove him and Tunstall as their competition.”</p>
<p>“More like just Dolan,” Widenmann interjected. “Murphy’s too sick with the cancer to do anythin’. Bastard’s drunk most of the time. Leavin’ Dolan free to do whatever he wants.”</p>
<p>“Plus an army of men without a moral compass betwixt them to back him up,” Henry added.</p>
<p>“Well, I wouldn’t say my compass is overly moral bound either,” I admitted. “But they killed an unarmed man who’s done nothin’ but tell the truth. We need to make them pay.”</p>
<p>“I’m with Will,” John Middleton finally said. He’d been silently leaning against the house, smokin’ a cigarette. He smashed it under his foot and looked to Henry. “I called to John as we fled. He chose to not follow us and it was too late by the time we realized it.”</p>
<p>Henry settled onto an old chair outside the kitchen door. “Then this is my fault,” he choked out. “Morton followed my tracks in the snow from the ranch back to y’all. If my horse hadn’t―”</p>
<p>“Don’t start that now,” Middleton said. “No one is to blame except Dolan and his men, and if we don’t fight back, <em>The House</em> will take everything and leave us for dead.”</p>
<p><em>The House </em>was what everyone in Lincoln County called those affiliated with what had been L.G. Murphy &amp; Co., recently becoming J.J. Dolan &amp; Co, as it was now run by Jimmy Dolan. Anyone who was a part of <em>The House</em> fell under his protection. Sheriff Brady himself owed so much money to <em>The House</em> that he was in their pocket for sure, along with other men of the law. This alone would make getting retribution for John’s murder a sticky situation.</p>
<p>With a hum of thought, Dick rubbed his trimmed chin beard. “McSween isn’t one for violence, but Dolan doesn’t respond to anything but. We have to find a way to…what’s the word? Compromise.”</p>
<p>The idea of not using violence made my trigger finger twitch. “Is that a bluff, or do you mean it for real play?”</p>
<p>“I have an idea,” Dick said, causing us to look at him. “We give it a few days. If McSween don’t do nothin’, I’ll go to Mr. Wilson.”</p>
<p>“Now you sound like Tunstall,” I said. “What is the Justice of the Peace gonna do? You said it yourself, Dolan will only respond to violence, and I’m happy to give it to him.”</p>
<p>Dick placed his great paw of a hand on my shoulder. “And you’ll get that chance. Just pull in your horns for a few days. Let’s see if we can make the killin’ of those bastards legal. All right?”</p>
<p>I never had liked waitin’. I was a get-it-done-now kinda man, but it made sense, so I agreed, sort of. I might’ve decided to do somethin’ to keep busy in the meantime.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>My momma used to say that idle hands are the devil’s playground. Well, I was livin’ proof of that. So I did the dumbest thing I could possibly think of; I snuck away as a bunch of angry townsfolk debated the situation, and headed down the street to poke my nose around the building that housed J.J. Dolan &amp; Company’s store. </em></p>
<p><em>I secretly hoped I’d get to shoot one of those sons of bitches, but then big, loyal, honest Dick Brewer discovered me and demanded he come along. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it started to snow again. But to tell you the truth, by the time we returned, I couldn’t have cared less about either of those things. Because what I saw that night gave me pause…the kind that causes nightmares and makes every bump in the night mean somethin’.</em></p>

<p>With a groan I muttered, ""Where the hell am I?""</p><p>""A hotel in the city,"" came a voice to my left.</p><p>Twisting my head, I pried my eyes open and in the dim light of the room, saw a young man sitting Indian style on the other bed playing cards. Of all things, he wore sunglasses and a ball cap.</p><p>He played a card and turned slightly to me, ""Do you play solitaire?""</p><p>Was he serious? I'd been attacked and died...ok, I thought I'd died, obviously, I had not. Right? I mean, here I was awake and all.</p><p>""Uh, no.""</p><p>""I recommend it. Helps pass the time."" He played another card.</p><p>I stared at him, but I couldn’t make out his features in the low light. It didn’t help that my vision felt fuzzy as well. ""Who are you? Why am I here? Why did you attack me?""</p><p>He moved a card from one pile to another. His only facial movement that said he heard me at all was the raise of a single eyebrow. Then again, that might've been for the game. Who knows? After he played another card, he said, ""I didn't attack you.""</p><p>Well, huh.</p><p>""Ok, how did I get here then?""</p><p>""I carried you."" Another card.</p><p>""And my attacker?""</p><p>""Got away. I injured him well and good though. Serves him right, hunting in my territory. I could've caught him. For some reason I decided saving you was more important. Not sure why. I don't even like you.""</p><p>""You don't know me. Now, I need to go home."" When he didn't reply, I carefully pushed myself up to a sitting position. ""Are you going to let me leave?""</p><p>He motioned to the door but didn't spare me a glance. I took that as a sign that I could go and swung my legs over the edge of the bed and slowly stood, head throbbing.</p><p>Dizzy, I reached out to steady myself on things as I headed to the door. Still not a word from the man with the cards, so I opened the door to find a hallway bathed in afternoon sunlight from a large window across from the room. Pain ripped through my skull like an ice pick shoved into my temple. Slamming the door shut, I dropped to my knees, forehead pressed on the door, and cried.</p><p>""I should probably mention that now isn't the best time,"" he said, sarcasm drenching his tone.</p><p>""What the holy hell?"" I yelled at him. ""What did you do to me? What was that?""</p><p>He placed a card and stared at the layout of them. ""Why can I never win this game? I mean, seriously, you'd think in ten years I'd have won at least once.""</p><p>""Hey, asshat, I don't care about your fucking cards! What did you do to me?""</p><p>With a sigh, he took off his sunglasses, and even with my impaired vision, I saw immense irritation flood his face. ""I would care to remind you, Sabrina, that if not for me, you'd be dead. Your pathetic little spoiled existence would be over. So you might want to show, I don't know, some manners of appreciation.""</p><p>""How do you know my name?""</p><p>He stood so quickly I almost missed it completely. ""I know everything about you, the world’s most self-involved, self-important, self-entitled girl I’ve ever known. Sabrina Grayson, the trust fund baby of Louise and Carl Grayson and party girl extraordinaire. Whose motto was, at one point, to 'just put lipstick on and everything will be ok.’"" He laughed and a memory stirred. ""A girl who ditched school, took boys who liked her for granted, and snubbed anyone who dressed different than her.""</p><p>""I do not! I—""</p><p>""You live off Central Park West in a three bedroom your mummy and daddy bought you, yet you still charge your roommates money.""</p><p>""We still have taxes to pay on it, thank you very much! And power and internet! Dear God, listen to me, why am I explaining anything to you?""</p><p>He grinned. ""Cause you are compelled to. I'm your creator.""</p><p>I laughed. I couldn't help it. Seriously now, you would've too, right? I mean, who talks like that?</p><p>""Look, I don't know how you know all that about me, but you are so wrong. I'm not some horrible person! I volunteer on committees, I donate to charities, and I buy my roommates things all the time!""</p><p>He laughed. ""With their own money, how giving of you.""</p><p>""I don't need to explain my actions to you. I don't even know you!""</p><p>He turned the bedside lamp up a notch, took off his hat, and mockingly bowed to me. ""Then let me re-introduce myself, my name is Alex Pryce.""</p><p>""Well, Alex, you can just..."" I stopped. I knew that name. It took moment, as if from another life, to remember. I examined him, my eyes still not one hundred percent. Stepping closer, I squinted and noted his square jaw, defined cheekbones, the deep blue eyes of my childhood, and the short, dark, messy hair that had been his signature. He grinned as one does for a student picture and it hit me in the chest. ""But you're dead. I...I went to your funeral. Back when I...<em>we</em>...lived in Connecticut. I was nineteen.""</p><p>He stood. ""So, she does remember. Impressive.""</p><p>""How are you here? I watched them bury you! I cried my eyes out.""</p><p>""Did you? How sweet,"" he said, obviously unmoved by my honesty. He began to pace. ""Why couldn't it be overcast again today? I hate being trapped in here.""</p><p>""Answer my question!""</p><p>""Why?"" He shouted, spinning to look at me in the face."" Before I could reply, he turned away again and said, ""You'll know all too well when night falls anyway."" He went into the bathroom and slammed the door between us.</p><p>I sat there, confused, and yet petrified. Therefore, I did the only thing I could think of. I picked up the room phone and called my best friend, and roommate, as her number was one of two I knew by heart. Ah...the electronic era, where devices do all the remembering for you. I got her kitschy voicemail.</p><p>""Hi-ya! This is Katie McBatey...leave your digits and maybe Katie will call you back. Ciao!""</p><p>""Katie, it's Bree. I just wanted you to know I'm ok. I got mugged in the park last night. Thankfully, I left all my shit at home. I'm uh...hanging out with an old friend who found me. My head is killing me so I'll probably not come home until later tonight. Feed Carmine for me. Bye! Oh, and if Bryce comes by tell him to go to hell.""</p><p>I hung up and eased onto the bed. I had two options, cry or try. I chose the latter. ""I went to school with your sister,"" I yelled out.</p><p>At first, nothing happened. Then the door opened and he leaned against the frame.</p><p>""Oh, I know. Kelly never shut up about you.""</p><p>""What? Why?""</p><p>He crossed arms over his chest. ""To be honest, I really never saw what was so amazing about you, but she'd have given a year's worth of allowance to be in your click.""</p><p>""What ever happened to her?""</p><p>""She's a Marine Biologist in San Diego. Happily married. Two kids. White picket fence. The works.""</p><p>""Happy to hear that,"" I said, not really meaning it.</p><p>""No you're not. But hey, why would you be?"" He stopped and walked slowly across the room to his bed. ""I'm not happy for her either. Being as I can't really visit her and all."" He paused. “Who’s Carmine?”</p><p>""My betta fish. And don’t change the subject. Why not just tell her you're not dead. It’s as simple as that.""</p><p>He looked down at me and said, ""Ah, but I am…and you are too. So what do you think about that, Miss Grayson?""</p>

<p>Courtney Behrent, as she was known to many, grunted as she lifted her suitcase up onto the bed at the 10th hotel in 60 days. She flopped, face first next to it, her feet the only thing hanging off the side of the queen bed.<br/><br/>""Are ya dead then?""<br/><br/>""If I say yes will you cancel the reading for tomorrow afternoon?""<br/><br/>""No. I'll just have Callie read it.""<br/><br/>Courtney turned her head and glared at her assistant, Malcolm, between dark red strands of hair that covered her face.

""Wait, what hot man?""<br/><br/>Feigning innocence, Malcolm placed an open palm on his chest. ""Oh, sorry, that would be me, not you. How I ever could mix that up, I have no idea.""<br/><br/>""Love life dig noted, Mal. Now go away.""<br/><br/>""Lack of love life dig, darling.

""See? That's just unhealthy. You're a famous author now. Go get someone. Anyone, for God's sake. Before you have cobwebs down there.""<br/><br/>Courtney laughed. ""I'm not famous, Mal. I’m just getting started.""<br/><br/>""You will be, mark my words. This tour has introduced many people to your work who aren't usually into Urban Fantasy. Now let's blow off unpacking and go get a drink at that snazzy club we saw on our way here. It’s just down the street. I hear celebs frequent it. British celebs. How yummy.""

Standing, he added, ""Put on something cute and let's go.""<br/><br/>""I don't wanna,"" Courtney whined, rubbing her ass.<br/><br/>""Yes you do. You love London. You love British men. Let’s find one!""<br/><br/>""I’m not going if you’re even think about trying to find me someone to hook up with. Last time it was just embarrassing.""<br/><br/>""You? Oh no, honey, I meant me!""

Unzipping it, Courtney noted the name on the suitcase: Alissa O'Brian. This was a name she tended to forget sometimes, which she found funny since it was the name she grew up with. Yet, since she had been ""hocking her wares"" as a writer for so long using her pen name, Courtney Behrent, it almost felt more real than her birth name.<br/><br/>Opening the suitcase, she selected the first thing she always did: a picture of her black and white Cardigan Corgi, Cooper. Ritualistically she hugged it and set the silver frame by the bed before picking out something to wear.<br/><br/>Facing the music, she stepped into the brightly lit bathroom to see how bad she looked. Her skin seemed an extra shade of pale and there were bags under her dark blue eyes, and bags under those. ""Lovely. Why am I going out again? Oh yeah, cause I'm single, spend too much time by myself, my dog is the best man in my life, and Mal will harp on me like my Irish grandmother if I don't go."" She grabbed some concealer &amp; attempted to correct what lack of sleep and multiple time zones had created.<br/><br/>""Of course I'm single. I'm never in a city long enough to know anyone, when I'm not book touring or at conventions I'm writing, and even if I'm home...dating in New York is shit."" She paused and put the makeup down. ""Why am I even trying? Screw this. I'm not in the mood. We'll just powder it, add mascara, and go.”<br/><br/>She barely attempted to tame the dark, auburn waves, pulling them into a loose, low riding ponytail, got dressed, and headed out. When she knocked on Mal's door she felt justified...until she saw the look on his face when he saw her.<br/><br/>""What the hell are you wearing?""<br/><br/>""What I want to wear. Are you coming or not?""<br/><br/>Mal seemed to be considering multiple responses, but chose to just say, ""As long as you don't tell people I dressed you. This fashionista can't blemish her record."" He shut the door. ""Let's go.""<br/><br/>Feeling vindicated, Courtney strode down the hall with him.<br/><br/>* * * *<br/><br/>""Are you out of you bloody mind?""<br/><br/>""According to you, always.""<br/><br/>""Seriously, Topher, with the crazy fan mail you have been receiving, I don't want you going out.""<br/><br/>Topher Matthews calmly perused his collection of elegant wrist watches. ""What you want and what I do are completely different things, Bradley.""<br/><br/>""As you often like to prove,"" Brad said under his breath as he ran fingers through short, thick blonde hair.<br/><br/>""I heard that. Now, the Rolex or the Patek?""<br/><br/>""Can you not just listen to me for once? Just once, Christopher?""<br/><br/>Topher's head snapped up. ""I don't go by that anymore, and you know why. Please refrain from it.""<br/><br/>""Oh for the love of God!"" He stopped after seeing the look on Topher's face. ""Fine. Go. Wear the bleeding Rolex for crying out loud. But I damn well am coming with you."" Brad grabbed his jacket. ""And call me Bradley again and I'll find every chance to say Christopher in public I can. Wear a coat, its raining."" He grabbed his windbreaker and crossed to the door of Topher's elegant flat. With hand in the doorknob, he sighed. ""Shagging hell, where are we going again?""<br/><br/>""Dstrkt."" Topher whirled his black trench coat on and grinned as Brad cringed. ""I already checked. Marisol isn't working tonight. You're safe.""<br/><br/>Brad opened the door. ""No one is safe from that woman.""<br/><br/>""How a bloke can keep his man-card while running away from a woman is beyond me. Just face her, mate.

Crashing through the window of a nearby building, the blast propelled her across the office inside and into a wall. <br/><br/>Coughing out, Maya pressed a button on her vest. “Run diagnostic.”<br/><br/>“RUNNING DIAGNOSTIC” ran across the faceplate of her helmet for her to read. <br/><br/>As she attempted to stay conscious, she felt the needle inside the vest push into her skin to read her vitals. She winced briefly. <br/><br/>As she waited for the comp unit in her vest to analyze her blood, she could feel herself starting to lose consciousness. <br/><br/>Finally, she saw it begin to run its findings on the faceplate.

On, off, on, off, from one eye to the next. She blinked, trying to focus. Where was she? She could just make out Andrian’s face above hers. He was talking but she couldn’t hear him. All she heard was a horrible, high-pitched ringing. Unable to focus, she closed her eyes again.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>The lights that passed by her closed eyelids were different from before.

Reluctantly Andrian began to back away, but she reached for him, grasping his wrist tightly. She needed to tell him.<br/><br/>“I’ll be right here. You’ll be fine,” Andrian’s lips said.<br/><br/>She shook her head and pain slammed into her, forcing her eyes open in shock. She didn’t have time for that now though. Swallowing back the bile the pain caused, she tried to speak. He moved closer. The doctor attempted to remove him again. This time she said, “No.” Or maybe she yelled it. She couldn’t hear so she wasn’t sure. Either way, everyone seemed to stop. “I saw him,” she said.<br/><br/>His lips formed the word, “Who?”<br/><br/>“The bomber. I saw his face.”<br/><br/>With that, the doctor finally won and detached him from her grasp, wheeling her into surgery, where she again blacked out.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Earlier that morning…<br/><br/>Maya Petrovskii slipped out into the darkness of dawn, her breath like smoke in the cold air. Zipping up her jacket, she scanned the wasted cityscape. The coast seemed clear. Then again, it was early enough that smart people were still asleep. Just in case, though, she shoved her long blonde hair up into a hat. Pulling the front brim of it down low to hide her face, she began to walk.<br/><br/>Winding through the darkened streets, her hands shoved deep in her jacket pockets, Maya’s knee-high black boots kicked at the trash that lay around. A windblown plastic bag caught on her toe and she shook it off. <br/><br/>Damn humans. It was bad enough they had destroyed the planet, but they continued to consider it a lost cause. <br/><br/>Stopping for a moment, she looked at the sky as it began to lighten to gray. Every morning she watched with hope that the sun might break through the Ink Cloud and shine on the Earth again. However, it didn’t look like today was going to be that day, so Maya put her head down and continued her trek down Eighth Avenue.<br/><br/>In 2128, the U.S. Government tasked human scientists to rebuild the fragile ozone layer. Between global warming and many dying off from cancer and other sun-related illnesses, a solution was mandatory. So in the summer of 2131, that solution, a self-sustaining chemical with the ability to block harmful solar rays, was released into the atmosphere. However, something went wrong. The chemical darkened the sky, blocking almost all radiation, both good and bad. <br/><br/>Darkness encased the planet, broken only by a dim gray light that shone through the Ink Cloud to distinguish day from night and prevent the planet from turning to ice. This cloud also freed the vampires from the sun’s dangerous rays, giving them free reign to roam the Earth at any hour. Due to this, and the fact that the Clandestine People didn’t die off when the oxygen waned, the humans learned of their world.<br/><br/>Scanning the dimly lit streets for a brief moment, Maya examined what had been a thriving area a hundred years ago. Her grandmother had told her stories of how Times Square had been so bright back then that even at three in the morning it was daylight. <br/><br/>Daylight. She remembered it vaguely. The sun had shone down on her eighth birthday party. She’d worn a blue sundress to match her eyes. The kids had played games on green grass under trees in the yard of their home upstate. <br/><br/>Remembering the warmth of the sun on her skin, Maya sighed. Then she shoved it out of her mind. Now wasn’t the time for reminiscing. Now was the time for training, for focus—she looked at her watch—and for hurrying the hell up.<br/>Adding some speed to her step, Maya reached the large steel door with the insignia of The Squad painted onto it, a fiery colored extended triquetra symbol. Holding her left wrist up to a scanner, a green light danced over her skin to read the chip embedded below. She heard the lock slide back. <br/><br/>Maya pushed the heavy steel door open easily, carefully closing it behind her. Hearing the locks reset, she began to walk down the long, narrow hallway, lit with long pipes of fluorescent lights. Halfway down the hall, she heard someone else enter.<br/><br/>“Maya! Wait up!” came a voice behind her. <br/><br/>Her lips pressed into a hard line but she stopped. It was too early to be dealing with people. Besides, she wasn’t happy with him right now.<br/><br/>“I’ve been trying to catch up to you for awhile. You’re fast.”<br/><br/>“Werewolf DNA will do that,” she explained before beginning to walk, again at a fast clip so that he would have to keep up. <br/><br/>“And my shape shifter DNA doesn’t? Is that what you’re saying?” he said, his tone lighthearted. “So, looks like we’ve got decent weather for flying today.”<br/><br/>Small talk. God, she hated small talk. “Look Andrian, I have nothing more to say now than I did last night.” She could hear the harshness of her tone and cleared her throat, trying to sound softer, “I’m sorry, my mind is set.”<br/><br/>He bolted in front of her, walking backwards so his six-foot-two frame faced her. His hazel-green eyes danced playfully. “I didn’t expect you would. Me, personally? I’m glad you said no. I was just keeping a promise to Denika—”<br/><br/>She came to a halt. “Stop right there. What does my grandmother have to do with this? She has no idea I work here.”<br/><br/>Andrian ran a hand through his short, silver hair, a wicked smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “If you say so.” With that he winked, turned, and bolted.<br/><br/>“Andrian! Come back here!” When he didn’t stop, Maya took off in pursuit of him through the corridors. By the time she caught up with him, he was in the locker room, along with the other early risers from her squadron. <br/><br/>She had two options. Let it go, or make a scene. She opted to let it go. For now. Walking over to her locker, she removed her coat and pretended to ignore him, attempting to keep her panic in check. If he’d told her grandmother she was a member of The Squad, she was going to be in deep shit. <br/><br/>Hanging up her hat, she stole a glance back at him. He taunted her with a grin and wink, saying, “What was that about faster werewolf DNA?”<br/><br/>That set her in motion. In one swift movement, she jumped the bench that separated them, grabbed his shirt, and pulled him behind the lockers, out of the view of most of their squadron. <br/><br/>Lightly, she pushed him into the wall. “Talk,” she ordered.<br/><br/>Andrian began to laugh.<br/><br/>Placing a hand on either side of his head, she leaned her six-foot frame into him slowly and said, “What position are you playing in this game, Officer Thale? Did you tell my grandmother about my job or not?” With a grin she added, “Tell me now and I won’t have to beat your ass.”<br/><br/>“Hey Thale, she wants to know your position,” she heard Andrian’s best pal, Channing Pierce, say from behind her.<br/>Officer Lou Harker joined in singing, “Bow chicka wow wow.”<br/><br/>Andrian laughed, a mischievous grin filling his handsome face. “Oh, honey, do spank me. I’m sure I deserve it.”<br/><br/>Maya quickly stepped away from him, but smacked his chest with the back of her hand in frustration. “You suck.”<br/><br/>“Break it up back there,” came the voice of her Commanding Officer. “We’ve got orders! Everyone head into the primary. That means you too, Officer Thale.” <br/><br/>Maya stifled a laugh with her hand over her mouth. She’d gotten him in trouble and that never happened. Not to Squadron Leader, Officer Andrian Thale. <br/><br/>“You’ll apologize for that,” he said with a grin.<br/><br/>“I don’t ever apologize if I can help it.”<br/><br/>“We’ll see about that,” he said, then planted a kiss on her nose, slipping out of her range before she could take a swing at him for it. <br/><br/>Wiping her nose with a grunt of displeasure, she said, “This isn’t over, Thale.” <br/><br/>Andrian laughed before running off to file into formation in the primary training room. Maya shut her locker and followed suit. <br/><br/>“Plans for today have changed,” the Major said. “We are being sent on an actual mission. There’s a situation in the Financial District to deal with. Human protesters have taken post outside the Clandestine-Human Relations Center in Heroes Square.”<br/><br/>“What for this time?” Channing asked. <br/><br/>“It’s the same old, same old. They want our kind to be registered.”<br/><br/>“Bagged, gagged, and tagged,” Andrian muttered to Channing.<br/><br/>The Major answered. “They feel threatened by our kind. This is to be expected, seeing as they are no longer in control of this planet.”<br/><br/>“Or at the top of the food chain,” Harker commented. <br/><br/>There was light laughter and mumbled agreement.<br/><br/>“This fear is why we stayed hidden for so many centuries,” the Major reminded them. “Word has it they’re putting together a resistance, and those are the people we believe are staging this protest.”<br/><br/>“Since when did we become the enemy?” Officer Harker quipped.<br/><br/>“The minute more of our kind survived The Blackout than them.”<br/><br/>“That wasn’t our fault,” Andrian stated.<br/><br/>It was true. If it hadn’t been for The Clandestine People foreseeing problems with the human ‘solution’ to the ozone layer, the humans would have no food now, or homes with viable air. Maya’s people supplied housing, jobs, and ninety percent of the food to the humans who survived the oxygen depletion caused by the rapid die-off of vegetation from The Blackout. <br/><br/>Raising her hand, she waited for the nod from the Major and asked, “Are you suggesting that the humans are preparing to do something drastic?”<br/><br/>“Not that we know of. Right now, we have a mob of rowdy humans causing a scene as Clandestine head to work down in the Financial District. We need them to disperse before rush hour is in full swing to advert any bigger issues. As this isn’t a huge emergency, the General’s orders were to suit up all last quarter Squad cadets and dispatch them to Heroes Square. Last exercise before the book test and graduation.”<br/><br/>“What do we need to do, sir?” Channing asked.<br/><br/>“Get them to leave. If they won’t, arrest them. Let’s get it done. You answer to your Squadron Leader, Officer Thale and he reports to me. Now everyone head to room W105 for your special gear. Wheel’s up in thirty. Dismissed.”<br/><br/>Maya quickly began moving toward W105 when a newly transferred officer, whose name she couldn’t remember, fell into step with her.<br/><br/>“Tell me about the area,” she asked Maya as they walked.<br/><br/>They turned a corner and Maya said, “Heroes Square is a large open space, like a paved park. It’s also a war memorial. Names of Clandestine, from New York, who’ve died fighting for this country dating back to the Revolutionary War. Erected to show the humans that Clandestine had fought and died just as they had.<br/><br/>“Thing is, it’s one of the nicer parts of the island down by the water. The wealthier people live and work down there, mostly Clandestine. If the protesters start a fight with them, we could have a bloody mess on our hands. Literally.”<br/><br/>The Squad Security Division, also called the SSD, had three uniforms. Today’s was meant for anonymity. The Anon Uniform, as they called it, was comprised of black military pants worn on the hips, a utility belt, a black turtleneck, and an armored vest. The latter of which could make even the most endowed woman seem as if she had no breasts. The helmet was made more for concealment and comfort than protection.<br/><br/>After tucking her pants into her black combat boots, Maya locked her locker and, with helmet in hand, headed to pick up her weapon. For a simple protest scatter, they would use tasers. This way they could subdue a human without using physical force.<br/><br/>“You ready for this Petrovskii?” Andrian asked, sidling up next to her as she walked for the air hanger.<br/><br/>“Yes, sir. You?”<br/><br/>“Born ready.”<br/><br/>She rolled her eyes at the cliché and was about to put distance between them when he took her hand and turned her to look at him. With his tone serious, he spoke quietly. “Don’t take any unnecessary risks. You’ve got a good eye. Keep me apprised of what you see. Okay?”<br/><br/>She wanted to tell him she could take care of herself, but the compliment threw her off kilter. She nodded once and he walked off. Entering the hanger, she saw her squadron piling into Hovercraft 5. That’s when she noticed her team wasn’t the only one hopping into hovercrafts. <br/><br/>Three other teams of cadets close to graduation were joining them on this training mission. Could the Major have downplayed the seriousness of the situation? Jumping into H5, Maya hoped that wasn’t the case.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p>Chapter 1<br/>New York City, 1989<br/> <br/>Sean could see his next victim through the smoke of the club as Siouxsie and the Banshees wailed out “Cities of Dust” over the speakers. As he took a drink, his honey-hazel eyes never wavered from his target. Yet it didn’t notice Sean. Of course, why would it notice him? Who was Sean to it? Nobody and nothing. Well, correction, the target might see Sean as dinner. But from where he sat, Sean was pretty sure his target didn’t even consider him worthy of that. He was too busy cozying up to some blonde. <br/> <br/>Blonde. Like Cassandra. Like Page.<br/> <br/>Sean swirled the ice around in his tumbler of Scotch. Every time he looked at the pretty girl with her young cherub face surrounded by blonde curls, on whom his target was making the moves, his stomach swirled like his drink. He downed the rest of the alcohol and ditched the glass. He wanted another. It’d have to wait.<br/> <br/>He ran his hand through his hair, moving his wide, dark curls out of his eyes, thinking, “Who is this target to me? Would it hold answers to finding Flora?” Maybe. Either way this creature was truly nothing and no one. Hell, it wasn’t even human so it ranked right up there with criminals and drug dealers on the street.<br/> <br/>Worse, this fiend was a murderer. Sean had watched it kill. Now he would wait for the creature to take its prey home and then he’d return the favor—by killing him, it, whatever. But, for right now, they were both just two anonymous individuals, dressed in black, lounging about in one of the city’s less popular Goth/Industrial clubs.	 <br/> <br/>Sliding on his black leather biker jacket, Sean decided to move closer to the target. As he approached, the male looking creature tucked some of the girl’s blonde hair behind her ear and leaned in to whisper to her. Sean cracked his knuckles. <br/> <br/>He’d been tracking the “guy” with the slicked back dark hair for weeks. To be honest, Sean didn’t like to think of them as male or female, more like “hosts-of-evil.” Yeah, it sounded stupid but it made his job easier. <br/>Leaning on the bar Sean saw the target take out a pack of smokes. The girl nodded. It took her hand.<br/> <br/>Shit.<br/> <br/>Sean immediately turned and headed for the main entrance of the club. As he exited, one glance at the bouncer told him that he was too occupied to notice Sean, who slipped out into the cool night air. Now he’d wait. <br/> <br/>How could this girl be so stupid? Maybe it was just Sean, but seeing as you could smoke inside in good ol’ NYC, if someone asked you to “step outside” for a smoke when it was cold out, maybe, just maybe, you should have used your smarts and seen that for what it was—a neon sign like in Times Square that said, “DANGER.” <br/> <br/>But oh no, not this girl. Damn damn damn. <br/> <br/>This put Sean in a bad spot. If the target tried to kill the girl here and now he’d be stuck having to kill it first. In public. In front of the girl. This was not good. <br/> <br/>Sean lit a smoke and leaned against the building to wait.  They didn’t take long. As the “couple” stepped out the door, the creature didn’t even glance at him. Instead it pretended to try and light a cigarette, claiming it was the breeze thwarting its efforts, in order to lure the young woman to follow it to the side of the building—into an alley. <br/> <br/>Sean sighed. It was so typical. Not even an original ruse. This thing needed to get a new playbook. Too bad it wouldn’t be around long enough to bother. <br/> <br/>Let me dry a tear for him…oh wait, I don’t have one.<br/> <br/>Sean took one last drag on his cig and then dropped it and stamped it out. He opened and shut the door to bar without going inside. Silently he crept to the edge of the building and pulled out a small compact mirror from his pocket and used it to see around the corner into the alley. Sean could see the creature in the mirror, which was strange since most of the time he couldn’t see their reflections. The reason for this anomaly was unclear, but to be honest, he’d never cared enough to figure out why—nor did he have time to think about that right now. He needed to act or she’d be dead. <br/> <br/>Save the girl, then think. Ha, now there’s some irony. FOCUS Sean!<br/> <br/>He reached into his inside jacket pocket and pulled his weapon. Slipping the mirror back into his pocket, he leaned his back against the building trying to stay calm. Killing in public was risky. He’d only done it once before and that had been a mistake. But could he let the girl die? She looked so much like one of his sisters.<br/> <br/>His dead sisters.<br/> <br/>Gripping the weapon tighter he heard the girl scream. That was his cue; it was now or never. Sean came around the corner and while the vampire started to feed on its prey, its focus wrapped up in bloodlust, Sean shoved the wooden stake through the back of the creature. The stake pierced the creature’s heart causing it to wail for a brief moment before it died. The bones and flesh disintegrated into dust, leaving just the clothes behind. <br/> <br/>The pretty blond collapsed to the ground, unconscious. With a quick look around him to verify no one was watching, Sean knelt next to her to check her pulse. 	<br/> <br/>She’s alive, thank God.  <br/> <br/>Quickly he picked up some of the vampire dust and sprinkled it into the wound on her neck. It quickly absorbed the blood and, as Sean watched, it also began to heal the wounds. By tomorrow there’d be no mark at all.<br/> <br/>Sean yanked his stake out from the vamp’s clothing and put it away. Then he looked for the vamp’s pants, pulled out the wallet and stuffed it into his jeans pocket. His heart was racing, fear of being noticed making him nervous. Even in this part of town, being found with a pretty girl unconscious outside a bar would be bad, sparking police questions he didn’t want to have to answer again.<br/> <br/>Quickly he grabbed her small purse and found her wallet and I.D. He pulled two twenties out and memorized the address on her I.D. before putting the wallet back in her handbag. Gently he scooped her up into his arms and carried her to the street to hail a cab. As he carried the blonde, her eyes fluttered open slightly. <br/> <br/>“Julian? What happened? I feel woozy.”<br/> <br/>Sean guessed this must’ve been the name of the vampire and she was confused. Yeah, Sean had dark hair but that was about where the similarities ended between him and the newly deceased. But he decided to play along anyway.<br/> <br/>“You passed out. Did you eat enough today?”<br/> <br/>He watched as a crease between her eyebrows appeared, eyes still closed. Finally she shook her head weakly. “Not enough for how much I’ve had to drink.”<br/> <br/>“Let’s get you home, shall we?” Sean suggested.<br/> <br/>She nodded and he waited for a cab to come by, which was a bitch in this part of town, to say the least. When one finally arrived, Sean held her up as he opened the door. After he poured her into the cab, he slipped the cabbie the two bills he’d taken from her wallet and gave him her address. <br/> <br/>“Call me tomorrow,” she said.<br/> <br/>“Of course,” he lied and shut the cab door.	<br/> <br/>As it sped away, he thought that she’d very likely remember nothing except a cute boy who didn’t call her back. That was so common, she’d not even think twice about what happened to poor ol’ Julian. <br/> <br/>The thought of the vamp compelled Sean to pull out the wallet. It had a couple hundred dollars inside as well as a few business cards. One of the cards said, “Sodom and Gomorra” and nothing else. No address. No number.<br/> <br/>Strange.<br/> <br/>He pocketed the cards and cash, tossed the wallet, and headed back into the club. Normally he’d have stayed outside but it was a bit chilly. Besides, this neighborhood wasn’t great. The Lower East Side had become quite overrun with drugs and drug dealers. Crack, specifically, had become an epidemic in Alphabet City. Sean knew this because he spent most of his time down there, and not just for the music. <br/> <br/>But it wasn’t for the drugs either; smoking and alcohol were his only vices. However, business was good for him in the neighborhood. Simply put, no one thought twice about a dead kid in the junkie territory. It was a vampire’s prime hunting ground so it had become Sean’s as well for the past year.<br/> <br/>Sean passed the bouncer, flashing his hand with the club stamp on it while keeping his head down. The bouncer barely glanced at him. Sean headed to the bar. It was time to start hunting for a new target—no better time than the present. <br/> <br/>His watch said that it was almost one in the morning.  If he was lucky, he’d find another vamp to begin tailing tonight. Chances were slim though. Friday night most of the scene was at a club called “The Building” over on 26th between 5th and 6th Avenues. In fact, Sean wouldn’t have been at this smaller club tonight if he hadn’t been tracking “Julian.” <br/> <br/>Sean sat on a bar stool, ordered another scotch on the rocks and lit a cigarette. He felt like all eyes were on him but he knew that was his paranoia about killing in public playing with his mind. As far as he knew, he never drew attention. He wasn’t tall or especially pretty, like many in the scene. <br/> <br/>At a glance, Sean was just a small guy who looked young for his age, just barely over five-foot-eight. His clothes hid how built he was. As an accomplished martial artist, he was strong but not brawny. The only thing he found interesting about himself was the long, thin scar that ran down the left side of his face from temple to jaw.<br/> <br/>He spun on the stool to lean his back against the bar so he could watch the crowd as they danced in a wave of motion to a song by Sisters of Mercy. He loved this music and the majority of the people who hung out in these clubs as well. This was good considering his prey seemed to flock here as well. <br/> <br/>Many of the kids in this scene were into the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre, be it Star Trek, Star Wars or live action role playing games that revolved around vampires and werewolves.  What better place for real vampires to hide than with those who try to pose as them? Thing is, Sean knew the difference.<br/> <br/>As much as vampires tried to blend in with humans they didn’t. To the untrained eye, these creatures seemed no different than humans. But Sean had spent years learning, watching, training, and could spot the difference immediately. <br/> <br/>Simply put, it was their movements that gave them away. Their walk was smoother, their actions more deliberate as if restrained. This was because they had to slow down every movement so as to move at a human speed. Not that it took a lot of concentration for those who’d been doing it for years—but Sean could still tell. <br/> <br/>Sean’s thoughts were interrupted by the bartender finally getting around to delivering his scotch. After paying her for it he took a healthy swig and the bite of alcohol burned his throat. Sean needed this to help settle his nerves. He took another drink using it to help diminish the thrill of the kill, which affected him in both positive and negative ways.<br/> <br/>He began to let his eyes scan across the pale faces of the dancers in the club. Who was just that much paler? Who moved just that much more smoothly? Who stood out? Subtleties were hard to see sometimes. Hell, it took him a week to find and verify the guy he’d just dusted in the alley. Last thing you wanted to do was put a wooden stake into a human. Scumbag or not, you needed to make sure that particular scumbag would go ‘poof’ and leave no evidence. <br/> <br/>After about fifteen minutes Sean thought he’d found his next target—a woman. She had spiky dark hair with the bangs dyed bright pink. She wasn’t as pale as the rest but she moved with fluidity that humans just didn’t have. He took another sip of his scotch and began to watch her more intently.  In fact, he was so engrossed in studying her that he didn’t detect that someone sat down next to him. So when she spoke to him he had to fight from choking on his drink.<br/> <br/>“She’s not your type,” the woman said smoothly, a definite British accent permeating her words.<br/> <br/>Sean turned to look at the woman next to him and pulled out a cigarette. She was pale, but her cheeks were flush. Either she was a vamp who’d just eaten or she was just a human. She didn’t smell like the vamps he killed, so he hoped this pretty lady was human. And she was stunning: tall and elegant with long blond hair and blue eyes like the ocean water after a storm. <br/> <br/>Yeah yeah, it sounds cliché but it’s the truth. <br/> <br/>Sean lit his cigarette and said, “Excuse me?”<br/> <br/>She nodded toward the girl with the pink tipped hair. “I’ve seen you around. She’s not what you’re looking for.”<br/> <br/>Maybe it was the words or possibly her tone but that sentence gave him pause. Did she know the real reason he was there? Did she know what he was, what he was looking for?  He felt his heart thump in his chest heavily as his breath caught in his throat. He took a drag from his smoke to give his heart a moment to calm down. Finally he forced a smile and turned to her, blowing the smoke just over her head. “And what is that supposed to mean?”<br/> <br/>“Let’s not play coy, shall we?” She said as she turned to him, her face a bit more serious as her eyes met his, “Leave her alone.”<br/> <br/>He laughed. “Uh huh. Okay darlin’. Whatever you say.”<br/> <br/>She got off the stool, and just as it seemed like she was going to slink away into the crowd, she did the opposite. She moved in close to Sean, took his cigarette, put it out on the floor, and leaned into his ear. “I know who you are…what you do. She’s not one of them, take my word for it. Focus your attention elsewhere.” She backed away from him, her eyes stern and powerful as they met his.<br/> <br/>Sean knew he needed to throw her off course, so he smiled at her in a friendly manner and said, “I have no idea what you’re talking about sweetheart.” <br/> <br/>A tiny smile touched her beautiful face—so flawless yet flushed with color, her teeth perfect and her eyes gleaming. “Oh really? So tell me, what is it called when three walk out of a bar and only one walks back in?”<br/> <br/>“Sounds like the beginning of a bad joke.” He pulled his pack of cigs out.<br/> <br/>The tall blond snatched the pack away from him and slammed it on the bar.<br/> <br/>“Aw come on, those are expensive, lady.” She just glared at him. “What?” Now he was in a panic. “Look, I stepped out for a cig. That’s it.”<br/> <br/>“So did the little blond and the man she was with.”<br/> <br/>“They left in a cab.”<br/> <br/>“I’m sure she did.”<br/> <br/>“What are you insinuating?”<br/> <br/>“Nothing. I’m just here to warn you that you’re starting to make a name for yourself and that you need to be careful. You need to make sure you don’t kill the good ones, or your fate will match theirs, I can promise you that.”<br/> <br/>“Good ones? What the—”<br/> <br/>“Remember that, Mr. Cameron.”<br/> <br/>And with that she turned and disappeared into the crowd, leaving Sean sitting there stunned, his mouth gapping open and his drink forgotten.<br/></p>

<p>Chapter One<br/> <br/>	Denika ripped a piece of her black tank top off and tied it around her upper thigh where it was still bleeding. She scanned the area below her for movement and saw nothing. Sheathing her sword across her back she jogged across the hill towards her second in command, Cash. With an under breath oath she picked up her second sword and looked out into the night, keen blue eyes scanning the shadows. <br/>	“Just surveillance, just bloody surveillance, is what he said. Why can’t anything be simple when you’re involved?” Cash said as he knelt to the ground to pick up his gun.<br/>	“Har har…come on, let’s see if we can round up any wounded stragglers who will talk, this op might not be totally blown if I can—” her eyes caught movement in the distance below. A dark figure hiding in the shadows moved along slowly with a limp. She didn’t know how he’d gotten that far ahead of them and she wasn’t happy about it. “Speaking of, there’s one getting away,” she stated, tone thick with frustration as she pointed at the hobbling figure moving through the playground.<br/>	“Not for long.” Cash pulled a new clip from his back pocket and slammed it into the gun. Shoving his mess of blonde hair out of his eyes, he looked at Denika’s leg, “You still bleeding? Sure you can handle this boss? I mean, I’m sure I can do this without you if you need to sit this one out.” He stood, a wide grin filling his handsome face.<br/>	“Ha! Nice try. Now quit dickin’ with your gun and let’s go. That is, if you can keep up,” she added with a daring smirk on her face as she slid the second of her two swords into the secure back harness. Without waiting for his comment, she ran at full speed to the edge of the large hill and leapt into the air, landing squarely on her feet in the grass below. Without pause she ran in the direction of the hobbling man who may have the answers she needed.<br/>	Denika heard Cash followed suit, landing behind her only seconds after she had. After hurdling one seeding fence after another she reached the stretch of lawn leading up to the tall fence surrounding Heckscher Playground of Central Park. <br/>	“He’s heading up Umpire Rock!” Cash said to her mentally.<br/>	“No shit,” she replied mentally. Did he think his eyes were better than hers? Arrogant ass.<br/>	Halfway to the fence a gun went off. Even using a silencer, her werewolf senses could hear it and her reflexes took charge. Training and luck were on her side and as she twisted her left shoulder down and back at the last second, it zipped past, embedding itself in the tree behind her. <br/>	“Jesus!” Denika gasped and then saw something worse than a bullet. Two dark figures appeared out of nowhere behind her second in command. “Cash! Behind you!”<br/>	He whipped around, pulling his long sword out in the same move. She heard metal upon metal before she saw it. Reaching behind she started to pull out one of her swords to go help him. With only two steps in his direction, three more dark figures dropped from the tree branches above to stand between her and Cash. Two turned towards her and one headed for her Beta.	<br/>	“At your seven, Cash!” she yelled out and then looked at the two large men in front of her. Denika realized she must’ve looked like easy pickings due to her small stature. Smiling, she unsheathed the second sword from her back. They were in for a surprise. “I really have somewhere else to be. Can we schedule this for later?” They both drew swords. “Well, if you insist.”<br/>	Denika advanced on the two men with immense speed, a sword grasped firmly in each hand; being ambidextrous has its benefits. In seconds, both her swords collided with theirs and she was spinning about with them. Both of her swords were made of a lightweight silver-steel compound. This meant that not matter if they were human or werewolf, a slice from her sword would cause a wound that wouldn’t heal right away. Much like her current leg wound. Question was, were they wielding steel or silver-steel?<br/>	Denika knew she needed to go after the primary target, not deal with these two. Not only that, but if Cash killed his attackers before her, she’d never hear the end of it. Cash wasn’t ambidextrous but he was extremely strong and fast, so much in fact that it evened them out talent wise. <br/>	Lightning fast she blocked one man and then the other, glancing then over towards Cash for a split second to make sure he was alright. This gave one attacker the opening he needed and she felt a sword tip slice her exposed stomach and then an arm, bringing her full attention back to her own situation. Without looking, she could feel the wounds begin to heal immediately. This was the benefit of being both a werewolf and of royal blood. That and the swords were definitely just steel.<br/>	Denika arced both swords on an inward to out motion, knocking her opponents steel out of her way so that with a swift change of balance, she arched, flipping backwards, kicking out to land a boot on each face as she did so. The two goons fell backwards, giving her the break she needed to head toward the primary target. <br/>	She bolted at full speed to the right, following the fence, hoping to get closer to the rocks. Problem was they were still close on her heels, too close. As they gained on her, a slew of Russian curse words escaped her mouth. As strong, agile, and fast as Denika was for her height, when fighting her own kind it didn’t change the fact that her legs just weren’t long enough to outrun them without more of a lead. <br/>	She veered to a tree to her left, ran up it a few steps, and flipped her body up and over to land behind the two men running after her. Without hesitation, as she landed she shoved one sword through the back of the man on her right. He howled out in pain as the other man came at her from the left. <br/>	With the right sword stuck in her other attacker, Denika swung her left to block his pal’s sword and planted a swift kick to his midsection with both feet. The man flew backwards as she and her previous kill fell to the ground. She twisted the sword and pulled it out, blood and tissue flying out of the hole in the man’s back as she turned to see his partner had gotten up and now rushed at her. <br/>	“Goddess, I don’t have time for this!” She grunted while coming up to her knees. <br/>	Swinging both swords in a parallel motion, she smashed them into his knees, causing him to fall to the ground before he rolled a few times. <br/>	With a swift motion, she brought her sword down toward the ground, severing his head from his body. Denika quickly jumped up and kicked his head away just in case it tried to reattach. She then turned to look for Cash.<br/>	He wasn’t more than twenty feet from her. One of his assailants was already dead on the ground while his second attacker had Cash in a choke hold. The man was easily fifty pounds heavier in muscle as well as a half-foot taller. If it had been anyone else but Cash she’d have rushed to help.<br/>	“Need some help?” Denika called out as she ran towards him.<br/>	“Naw, I got this,” he choked out. “Stay back!”<br/>	“Well then, quit dickin’ around, we gotta go!” she yelled back, hiding a smile. Nothing spurned her Beta on like attitude.<br/>	“Do I look like I’m dickin’ this dude?” he grunted out, his hands on the man’s arm, trying to pull it from his throat.<br/>	“Yes it does! But if you want help…”<br/>	He rolled his eyes, “Give me a second.” Then, with a yell, he squatted and flipped the man over his head with a spin, causing the man to land face down in the dirt. Cash spun, grabbed his sword that was sticking out from the ground, and as the man got up to his knees Cash arced the sword, connecting with the man’s chin, slicing upwards on an angle until it exited the top of his head. “See? All done,” he said as the man tipped over.<br/>	Denika sheathed her swords across her back. “‘Bout time! Let’s go!” Without waiting, she ran at the tall playground fence, planted her hands on the flat top of one of the posts, and flipped herself over, landing steadily inside playground. Trusting that Cash would follow she barreled forward, touching the device on her throat and saying, “We need clean up just outside Heckscher Playground!”<br/>	A voice came back in their earpieces, “We have a little bit of turbulence over here ourselves. I’ll call it in though.”<br/>	“Anything you guys can’t handle, Marlen?”<br/>	“We’re fine. Phin and Liam seem to be getting it under control. How many you got, boss?”<br/>	“Hell, four on the ground, possibly twice that on the rock?” she said.	<br/>	“I’ll contact The Squad.”<br/>	Denika ran across the cement bridge that led from the playground to the rock. “Good. We’re at Umpire Rock trying to snag a straggler. Over-n-out.” Denika stopped and sniffed the air. She could smell blood, and not just hers. It was close to her and seemed to go to the left. She motioned for Cash to go to the right. He shook his head and touched his nose as he pointed toward the trail she’d noticed. Obviously he could smell the blood trail too and wanted to go that way.<br/>	She shook her head once and pointed for him to go to the right. He was pissed but as Beta he didn’t have a choice but to obey the Alpha of the pack. Besides, he knew it was a better to come at the man from opposite sides. He turned and went around one way and she the other. <br/>	Pulling one sword out, Denika quietly and gracefully moved around the side of the rocks, staying as hidden as possible. The blood trail seemed to disappear once she was on the other side. Tucking her dark curls behind her ear to get them out of her eyes, she crouched down to get a better whiff.<br/>	The smell of blood stopped because, simply enough, so had the blood trail. Either he stopped to wrap the leg when they were fighting his fellow goons or he had jumped. If he’d cleared the rest of the rocks and picked up running wherever he landed she’d need to try and find where the blood trail picked up somewhere out there in the dark. <br/>	“Damn it, where is a blood sucker when you need one?” she whispered.<br/>	Werewolves could follow blood and scent easily, like a dog. However, a break in the trail made it hard to pick up unless you know which direction they headed, which she didn’t. A vampire, on the other hand, could follow the scent of the body’s essence itself as well as the heat trail they left behind. <br/>	The wind picked up and she put her nose in the air to sniff. Picking up his scent she began to head in that direction, staying low to the ground and in the darker shadows. That is when she spotted Cash, walking out into the open on the right side of the flat rock, his blonde hair catching the light. A shot rang out. She dropped flat to the ground but watched as Cash took a bullet to the shoulder, then to the thigh before he went down.<br/>	“Cash!” she screamed out and ran for him, staying low. <br/>	Another shot fired. It came from up in the trees somewhere out in front of them. They were sitting ducks on the rock. She had to re-maneuver their position. When she reached Cash, she saw he was bleeding bad but trying to get up.<br/>	“Stay down!”<br/>	A gun shot fired off and she rolled just in time as it hit the rocks next to her knee. “Damn!” Denika touched the device on her throat again. “Mayday mayday—we got shots fired at us at Umpire Rock. Beta has been shot, repeat, Beta shot! Need back-up!”<br/>	She sheathed her sword and got both her hands under Cash’s arms to pull him over to a huge crevice. <br/>	“Leave me here, go after him,” Cash said.<br/>	She pulled him a bit further. “I’m not leaving you here.”<br/>	“You called for help now go!”<br/>	“The hell I will!” she said, pulling him a few more feet to the side. A gunshot fired off, missing them again. “Jesus!”<br/>	“I’ll lay cover down for you—go!”<br/>	“Not till we pull those bullets out of you!” she said, and as random shots hit the rocks. Adrenaline kicked in and with one last pull she rolled all two hundred plus pounds of him into a large crevice and then jumped in after him, both now fully obscured from the sniper. Helping him sit up, his back against the rocks, Denika squatted next to him to check his wounds.<br/>	“I’m fine,” he grumbled.<br/>	“Fine my ass. Hold still.” she looked at his shoulder as panic threatened to press on her chest. With a quick realization that the shoulder bullet was out she took a deep breath. “This is a through and through.” She ripped off another piece of her black tank like she’d done for herself earlier and tied it under his arm and around the shoulder tight.<br/>	“Ouch! Damn it, boss!”<br/>	“Gotta stop the bleeding.” Denika looked at his leg, ripped off another strip of material, and handed it to him. Any more wounds and she might as well take off her tank and fight in her bra, she thought. “I trust you can get that bullet out of your leg and tie this yourself?”<br/>	His green eyes flashed great irritation with her. “Of course I can! Now get where you can fire on this asshole!”<br/>	Denika wore two guns, one on each leg. She pulled the one from the right thigh harness and checked that it was loaded. “Cover me while I get to that tree.”<br/>	She scooted over to the edge of the rock, waited for him to fire a few rounds, and used that to cover slipping behind the closest tree, about twelve feet from where Cash hid. She even had time to poke her head around and fire a few rounds up into the tree before they retaliated with shots of their own, which were now coming faster. <br/>	“Cash!” she whispered, “You got those heat sensor shades?”<br/>	“Yes ma’am I do!”<br/>	“Toss ‘em here!”<br/>	He dug them out of his side pocket. “Ya know, last time you broke my pair.”<br/>	“Wa wa wa…toss ‘em here big man.”<br/>	“I’ll use ‘em! I got a shot from here.” <br/>	“He’s too far to the left for you to have a clear shot. I got him clean from this angle and you know it! Now give ‘em here!”<br/>	Denika heard a grumble and then something landed on her foot. She bent down and felt them lying by her toe. She snatched them and slid them onto her face. Sticking her head around the tree again they were showered with bullets.<br/>	“Motherfucker has an automatic sniper rifle with silver bullets and a partial silencer! Who the fuck is this guy?!” Cash yelled over the gunfire.<br/>	 “No idea but silencer or no, if this keeps up someone will hear and alert the good ol’ NYPD and we can’t be havin’ that! I’m gonna end this. You ready to cover me?”<br/>	“Always.”<br/>	“On the count—one, two, three!”<br/>	Cash twisted himself about, slipping out just enough to see, and began to fire off a bunch of shots toward the tree. This gave Denika the chance to lean out without being fired upon. <br/>	Looking up into the trees she quickly spotted his heat signature, glowing at her from about thirty feet up in a tree to the left. She took aim and squeezed off a few rounds and watched as the glowing body reacted to the bullet and fell from the tree. After the thud the shooter made hitting the ground, all was silent.<br/>	“Well done boss!”<br/>	Denika let out a sigh of relief, leaned against the tree, and listened for a moment, listening. She’d not wanted to kill him and secretly she hoped her usually perfect aim hadn’t been. She couldn’t question him if he was dead.<br/>	Since she heard nothing moving, Denika went over to Cash as she slid the glasses up on top of her head. “I’m going to go out for a look.” She looked down at his leg; it wasn’t wrapped yet and was bleeding all over the rocks. Taunting him with a grin she asked, “Do you need me to go get your mommy to pull that silver out for you?”<br/>	“Oh fuck you. Been a bit busy, thank you very much.”<br/>	“Well, now you’re not. Get that silver out of there and wrap it up. I’ll be right back.” The longer the silver bullet was in his tissue the more it would hurt, the sicker he’d feel, and there was a larger chance it would do permanent damage.<br/>	His hand grabbed her ankle. “Where you goin’?” <br/>	“I need to see if he’s alive or not. I’ll be right back.”<br/>	“Wait for back up, boss.” <br/>	“He’s laying out where anyone can see him Cash, I need to move him. Take care of your leg. That’s an order.” With that, she stepped out of his hold and away from the rock’s protection.	<br/>	“Damn it Denika, get back here!”<br/>	As she moved out into the open she saw no one else. She sniffed the air and smelled no one but herself, Cash, and the guy from the tree. But if someone was approaching from downwind she wouldn’t smell them, so she moved quickly to the man lying on the ground. <br/>	Again, she hurdled a seeding fence and high tailed it across the grass. That’s when she saw the man had fallen backwards, landing on the blacktop path. Denika jumped the next seeding fence as she cursed. This all would be easier if Central Park didn’t fence off their grass like it was an animal at the zoo to be stared at in wonder. <br/>	Denika crouched down and touched his neck. His pulse was slow and though injured, he was alive. Quickly she realized how many lampposts were in the area. With a grunt, she lifted the huge man to a sitting position, leaning his side against the fence. <br/>	As she finished she noticed a couple, holding hands, walking towards them. Damn it! They must’ve been walking around the park. Who does that this late? <br/>	Still in a squat, she slipped her gun behind her and turned to faced them. Relying on the glamour spell on her swords to work, Denika looked up at the couple with a smile. “He can’t hold his liquor even at his weight! He’ll be embarrassed tomorrow!” she laughed. <br/>	Without offering to help, they veered in the opposite direction and hustled out of the park. This didn’t surprise her. Humans may not see the danger of her world, but they could feel it sometimes. Once they were on their way, Denika focused back on her captive, more specifically she examined the leg and began to curse again. He didn’t have a leg wound. This wasn’t the man they had been chasing.<br/>	“Looking for me?” <br/>	She spun about. There sat a man, on the green bench, looking very relaxed, one leg crossed over the other like her dad use to do, his right arm draped along the back of the bench and a gun in his left hand directly pointed at her head. This man had an injured leg. This was their guy. <br/>	Problem was he now wore a black ski mask with mesh over the mouth and eyes so that she couldn’t see through from her side. She had no idea who he was.<br/>	“Drop your gun,” his deep voice said. It sounded modified by something in his mask.<br/>	“You first,” she said with a smile. He pulled the hammer back on the gun and she cursed in Russian under her breath, dropping her gun to the ground. <br/>	“Kick it away.”<br/>	Instead, she stood up. It was a better tactical advantage. “Who do you work for?”<br/>	He laughed. “Kick it!”<br/>	“Fine fine—” Denika said and kicked her gun across the path into the dirt of the kickball diamond. <br/>	He motioned for her to raise her hands so she did, lacing her fingers behind her neck. She figured if she could keep him talking, the rest of her team would be here in moments and they would take him down. <br/>	“You know, your friend here isn’t fatally wounded, you can still take him and go.”<br/>	The man turned his gun briefly and shot the man in the head. “Not anymore.” He turned his gun quickly back on Denika. <br/>	“You kill me and you’ll have the whole Order after your ass.”<br/>	“I wouldn’t bet on that,” his distorted voice said.<br/>	“Why? Who do you work for? I’ll pay you double what they are. We can make a deal.” <br/>	He coughed out a laugh and then stood as he said, “You talk a lot.”<br/>	A shot rang out and grazed the man’s arm. It would’ve hit him in the back if he’d not moved at the last minute.<br/>	“Tell me about it!” a voice said from behind the mystery man. It was Cash. He’d somehow gotten enough strength in his leg to totter out into the open, like the fool he was.<br/>	Cash fired two shots at the man but he moved like lightning and was up and dodging in seconds. His first move saved him from the second bullet but the third hit him in the chest. Reeling backwards, he fired upon Cash, who ducked behind the tree their sniper had fallen out of. Once he saw he’d missed, the man started to run towards Central Park West. <br/>	If he reached it, he’d snag a cab and they’d lose him. She couldn’t let that happen. Denika headed towards her gun and stooped to pick it up when another shot rang out. She heard Cash yell out her name, but as she stood up she felt a bullet go through her chest. Another hit the left side of her head and she went down.<br/>	“Denika!” Cash yelled. Suddenly his face was above hers. “It’s just a grazing on your head—hang in there—I can hear Marlen coming with the team.” He touched his throat. “Mayday, Alpha down,” he choked out, his voice catching. “Alpha has been hit—Marlen get your ass the fuck over here now! Path by the kickball field.”<br/>	“Shit. On my way. Hang on!” Came Marlen’s voice in their earpieces.<br/>	She could feel blood on her face and a warm sensation at her back that told her blood was<br/>pooling out under her onto the blacktop. She coughed and tasted blood. She reached up to grab Cash’s glasses from the top of her head. “I didn’t break them this time,” Denika tried to grin. <br/>	He took the shades from her. “You crazy woman, I don’t care about the—”<br/>	She coughed again and the pain finally began to hit her. She opened her mouth to wail but the pain was so encompassing, she found she could make no sound as her body curled in on itself instead.<br/>	Cash’s hand grasped her. “Hang in there Denika—just hang on!” He took her hands for her to squeeze, which she did until it all went dark.<br/></p>

<p>“It wasn’t a peacock, it was a vampire!  That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you this whole time!  You could tell from its horrible, glowing red eyes that that bird was nothing other than the shade of a demon.  If I hadn’t had my wits about me I’d have been in its thrall even now!”<br/><br/>I need to stay professional here.  Hold on, Brenda, you’re nearly at the end of your shift.  Why is it always the craziest ones that have to come last on the docket?  It’s only a couple hours until dawn, and I do not want to have to deal with that in my life right now.<br/><br/>It all seemed so noble back when I first decided to become a public defender.  Well, at least I wanted to make myself believe it was noble, since there aren’t a whole bunch of legal positions that let a woman work a graveyard shift, and it seemed like New York’s night court circuit would be a good place to keep a low profile.  I certainly can’t argue there: making a case for petty criminals, most of whom were caught in the act, who can’t afford legal representation isn’t exactly front page material.<br/><br/>But did it have to be a vampire peacock, of all things?  It’s pretty cruel of Fate to just throw that back in my face.  I’m not exactly “out and proud” about my blood cravings, even in the Afflicted community, which is what they—okay, we—prefer to be called.  I hardly even seen any of them (that I know of) for nearly two years now, ever since that night at the Chrysler Building…  My memories of that night are still hazy, and when I even try to think about it I get a migraine bad enough to make me wonder why I even bother.<br/><br/>After all, my life’s nearly back to normal now—probably as close to normal as it’s ever going to be again—so why torture myself with that other world?  Most of the Afflicted don’t even have jobs, at least in my experience, and Hap told me enough to confirm my suspicions.  Oh, Hap—I wonder where he is these days.  But then again, it’s probably better that I don’t know.  He taught me how to get by as a member of the Afflicted, but in the process I learned things about him that…  Well, let’s just say that I can’t unlearn them.<br/><br/>Anyways, I know enough about the Afflicted to know that they almost definitely didn’t have anything to do with the peacock that my client is talking about.  Still, I guess it couldn’t hurt to make sure.  “What were you doing when the peacock attacked you?”<br/><br/>“I was breaking into the zoo.”<br/><br/>My composure stays up, but I’m doing a facepalm on the inside.  “And you were doing that because…?”<br/><br/>“Because I needed to expose the treachery of the zoological cabal that secretly runs this city!”<br/><br/>“Um, let’s get back to the peacock.  It attacked you, and then you stabbed it with a kitchen knife, correct?”<br/><br/>“I’ll have you know that the Sword of Justice is no mere kitchen knife!”<br/><br/>Okay, thats enough.  This clearly doesn’t sound like the work of the Afflicted: there’s no way that they’d be organized enough to pull something like this off, and at any rate this man has far more issues to contend with in his life.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this is one of those cases where being Afflicted actually comes in handy for me.  I stare deep into the man’s bloodshot, unblinking eyes and concentrate on the time frame when the police report said the crime occurred.  It’s a skill that I’m still getting the hang of, but this is as good a chance to practice as any.<br/><br/>There.  That should do it.  “Now could you tell me again what you were doing at the zoo, Mr. Abernathy?”<br/><br/>“The zoo?  Why would I be at the zoo?”<br/><br/>Much better.  I can definitely pass this off as a mad black out now, and get this man the therapy he needs.  It’s a good sign that he only reacted to the event, too: it seems like he still recognizes his own name.  It’s a dangerous game, erasing people’s memories.  It certainly helps when you’re trying to make someone okay with the fact that you just liberated them of a pint or two of their blood.</p>

<p><em>Excerpt of <strong>Hate That I Love You</strong> (Dark-Hunter Fanfic)</em></p><p> </p><p>She hissed. “I really hate you.”<br/>“I hate you too, precious.”<br/>The fire in his lavender eyes wasn’t in harmony with his words. It spoke loud and clear about the lust he felt for her. He gazed her mouth again and again, as if he was a thirsty dying man and the spring of fresh water that could save him poured out from her lips.<br/>“Savitar, stop! Stop it!!”<br/>“What?”<br/>“Stop looking me like that!”<br/>“Like… what?”<br/>Her nostrils flared. “Like if you want to eat me!” <br/>His eyes roamed her from head to toes with deliberated appreciation, stopping for long moments in the right places. He took his time to take in her beautiful figure covered by black airy silk. The fabric hugged the curves of her body with extreme delicacy. The neckline showed a peek of the contour of her breasts… a small tease. But the real bait was on the rear. The posterior cleavage went south, all the way down, to her lower back.<br/>Under Savitar’s intense scrutiny, Apollymi felt her temperature rising even more, as if lava was running through her veins. The dress constricted her swelled breasts, and her heart beat faster than the wings of a hummingbird. She wanted to stepped back or make him go away, but she was paralyzed. Savitar walked into her personal space, but didn’t touch her. He held his gaze into hers. His eyes darkened and his pupils dilated. <br/>“Would you let me?” he asked in throaty voice.<br/>Her negative got caught in her throat. She gulped trying to get rid of the lump closing off her airway.<br/>Savitar grinned and caressed her jaw with the back of his fingers. “Your silence speaks volumes, Polly.”<br/>“No,” she managed to utter through her clenched jaw. “All I want is you away from me.”<br/>That didn’t seem to discourage him in the least. In fact, Savitar’s smile got bigger. “It that so?”<br/>“Yes.”<br/>“Then, why are grabbing my shirt so tight?”<br/>Apollymi looked down and her eyes widened watching her fingers wrapped around the rim of his shirt. She let go right in that instant, and stepped back. However, she didn’t go far.<br/>Savitar wrapped his arms around her waist and kept her close.</p>

<p>Who knew how many time had passed when Bethany woke up again… it should be hours later, the sun was bright and high. This time the awakening was in a much more pleasant way. Styxx had her wrapped in his arms, her back against his chest and their legs intertwined. All the eternity wouldn’t be long enough for her to understand how he could breath with his face buried in her hair, but it was an habit that obviously he hadn’t been able to break. And what made it weirder was that she found it comforting. The few nights she had sleep without him, she missed feeling his breath in the back of her neck.<br/><br/>In that instant she was afraid to move. Beth wasn’t sure if Styxx was asleep and she didn’t want to wake him up. She didn’t want to take the little rest he got from slumbering. After make love, he had trouble falling asleep due the nightmare that had woke him up early in the morning. That wasn’t common in him, not that the sleep eluded him often, because it did, repeatedly over the years and all his life, but that sex didn’t wear him off enough to succumb.<br/><br/>She already knew it, but that had confirmed her how bad the dream had been. Against her instinct, Beth had asked him about it and she got the reply she knew she would get. <br/><br/>“I don’t want to taint you with memories that aren’t worthy to tell,” he said. “Close your eyes, sweetie, you sleep and I’ll watch your dreams.”<br/><br/>She had conceded. Beth didn’t asked again, but waited until he relaxed. It seemed hours before Styxx’s breathing finally even out and fell asleep. It was her who watch him sleep for a while until she also snoozed off.<br/><br/>“Good morning, my lady,” Styxx whispered in Beth’s ear and snuggled her tighter against him. She smiled feeling how very awake he was. Her body ignited feeling his hardness against her.<br/><br/>“Good morning to you too” rolling over, she faced him and kissed his lips. “I thought you were sleeping.”<br/><br/>Styxx shook the head and claimed Bethany’s lips with his own, nibbling them with slow and deep passion. He couldn’t get enough of them, of their softness and warmth. He needed them. He needed his Beth more than the air itself. He had spent so much time longing for the opportunity of kiss her one more time, that he was afraid that he was going to wake up from this wonderful dream and find himself in his hellish life, alone and heartbroken.<br/><br/>Beth sensed the track of his thoughts, as she felt him tensed and the kisses became more desperate and erratic, but not in good way. She cupped one of his cheeks, tracing the fingers in soothing way and put the other hand over his heart, feeling how it beat at furious pace.<br/><br/>That seemed to push away his demons and calm him enough to return to be the loving and sweet man he always had been. <br/><br/>“You know,” she said breathlessly, as Styxx was trailing kisses down on her neck, “w-we should get out of…bed. I don’t think—” she gasped when Styxx took one on her breasts in his mouth. “I don’t think Savitar will… will allow us to stay here much longer. We should go home,” Styxx looked up at her, his Aegean blue eyes shining with intensity. <br/><br/>“You’re talking about another man… while I’m making love to you? What’s wrong with you, woman?!”<br/><br/>For a second Bethany believed that she had offended him. “Styxx, I didn’t… I—,” until she saw a grin growing in his face. “Oh, you’re bad!”<br/><br/>He started laughing out loud, rolled over and laid beside her. “You made it easy, love. I couldn’t resist.”<br/><br/>She should had been mad at him, but watching him laugh was such joy for her that gladly she could become his buffoon, as long as she made him happy.<br/><br/>“I see you woke up in good mood.”<br/><br/>“Why shouldn’t I? I got the woman I love with me; our son is alive and well; and I think I have my brother back. What else can I ask for?”<br/><br/>“So? We go home?”<br/><br/>Styxx nodded. “One condition, though. That you take care of me,” Styxx looked down meaningfully, “later when we’re there.”</p>

<p>Ella dio un paso atrás, sobresaltada, cuando Leo le puso los ojos encima. Esa no era la mirada de siempre, dulce, amable y cálida. Era la misma que había tenido en el callejón. Fría y salvaje. Victoria se estremeció de miedo y de excitación. Lo primero lo podía comprender, porque la intensa sensación que transmitía esos ojos intimidarían a cualquiera. Pero, lo segundo estaba más allá de su entendimiento. ¿Cómo era posible que ella sintiera eso cuando él la miraba como si quisiera comérsela?… y no precisamente a besos.<br/>La sangre hervía en sus venas con el solo pensamiento de él tomándola rudamente. ¿De verdad ella quería experimentar eso? Sus fantasías sexuales nunca fueron muy imaginativas o extravagantes. ¿Qué le estaba sucediendo? ¿Acaso había perdido la cordura? ¿Por qué la hacia sentir tan viva?<br/>Leo dio un paso hacia delante con la mirada fija en ella, relamiendo sus labios, como si se estuviera saboreando algo delicioso. Instintivamente, ella retrocedió, manteniendo la distancia. Él dio otro paso y ella repitió el movimiento. La danza continuó hasta que ella se topó con la pared, ya no tenía a donde ir.<br/>Leo curvó las comisuras de la boca, claramente entretenido. ¿Cuál era la gracia? Ella no lo sabía. Quiso decirle que volviera a la cama pero él la calló, levantando su mano y dando otro paso hacia ella.<br/>—No necesitas decir nada, yo se lo que deseas —le dijo.<br/>Su voz era mucho más grave que de costumbre. Con un ligero acento teutón que Victoria jamás le había oído a Leo. Era en tono suave, bajo e irresistible. Que invitaba a los mas dulces placeres. Ella se encontró hipnotizada por sus palabras mientras se la acercaba, más y más.<br/>—Que mujer tan deliciosa eres —la miró de arriba abajo, con deseo—. Y estás aquí, sólo para mi.<br/>Terminó de recorrer la distancia que los separaba y puso las manos contra la pared, una mano a cada lado de Victoria, encerrándola entre sus brazos. Ya no tenía escapatoria. La sensación de haber caído en la trampa de un depredador la dejó sin aliento. Y se hubiese recuperado rápidamente de ella, de no se por percibir el exquisito aroma de Leo.<br/>En ese momento dejó de pensar, de buscar explicaciones; solo quería sentir, saborear, perderse en ese divino olor. Él se inclinó sobre ella y olisqueó su cuello. Su tibio aliento, le erizó la piel.<br/>—Tu excitación te hace más encantadora —le susurró al oído, antes de lamerle el cuello, justo sobre la yugular.<br/>Antes de que ella pudiera evitarlo, gimió de placer. Su cuerpo tenía vida propia y, aunque en el fondo de su mente había una voz diciéndole que debería detener los avances de Leo, no conseguía hacer que sus músculos la obedecieran. Leo se acercó aun más a ella, aprisionando la contra la pared. La tomó por los brazos firmemente, con gran fuerza, casi haciéndole daño.<br/>—Leo…<br/>—Tranquila, no sentirás nada.<br/>—¿Qué…?<br/>Victoria sintió como el pánico crecía en ella, algo no estaba bien.<br/>—Leo, por favor. Suéltame —intentó liberarse, pero él la sostuvo con mas fuerza. La estaba lastimando. Ella no dudaba que le saldrían moretones—. Me estás haciendo daño…<br/>—Suéltala, Leopold —dijo una voz masculina—. ¡Ahora mismo!</p>

<p>Third and final part of a series ""It's all a Lie"" . It's sometime in the near future. Government, Corporations, and ""religions"" have created a semi-fascist government and are in an everlasting great depression where the poor are in workhouses or migrant workers or forced into crime, the middle class and rich are obsessed with buying and corporations don't care.  America is covered with malls, fields of corn, and destroyed or polluted areas due to the never ending search for fuel. Only the rich can fly and owning a car is a luxury few can afford. <br/><br/>In part one ""The Camp"" Sarah was a normal teenager who after the petty crime of graffiti is sent to a rehabilition camp for teens. The camp is nothing but a work camp run by a sadistic man whose uses the name of god to belittle, overwork and occassionally assault the teens working at the camp.  In Part 2, ""Marymount"" Sarah escapes but ends up in Marymount where rival gangs run by cruel male bosses fight over who can sell knock-offs of famous brands.<br/><br/>In Part three ""The Lessons of History"" Marymount is destroyed by a mall expansion and Sarah finds herself on the run through a country obsessed with buying, violence, and false religion with the rest in dire poverty. Sarah finds some kindness on her travels, an migrant worker, a trucker, an old man living in an abandoned house, underground churches that are chastised for helping the poor and a cop who is tired of what he sees. Sarah's travels have taught her that good people still exists and she must learn to live her life on her own terms in a society that can no longer survive. </p>

<p>Shourron I had earned the dubious record of the worst of the Mages, through no doing of his own. Infected with a genetically engineered leech before his birth, he had wreaked havoc in the civilized universe...but what happened before then?</p>

<p>Morgan Coramus straightened up and flung her gun over her shoulder. She shook her head, wondering how it is that all the jobs that she had taken on lately were so predictable in nature. There was only a small handful of reasons that someone would hire an assassin: money, revenge, or silence. Invariably, the individual reasons had all boiled down to one or another version of these three major categories. <br/><br/>Sigard was simple: his usually fell into the category of silence. He was a con artist and a crook, and the most valuable thing to his type was, inevitably, loyalty. His orders were clear: track Morrhia and silence her if she would think to turn on him. <br/><br/>Well, she did. And for the first time in her career, Morgan thought that maybe, just maybe, she wouldn't go through with this job. After all, she couldn't blame a woman for wanting to survive. That's what she herself has been doing for the past thousand or so years. <br/><br/>And she almost didn't do it. That may have been a crucial mistake. She wasn't supposed to let Morrhia share any information, never mind the actual location of Sigard's penthouse. Assumed name or not on Sigard's part, that was already a botch on her own. <br/><br/>Morgan Coramus didn't like botching things. <br/><br/>She paused for a moment, using the electronic billboard as a vantage point, and observed the melee unfolding below her in the Seventh sector metropolis. The aircar with the guard squad was hovering in the middle of the traffic lane, and reinforcements had arrived and begun to divert traffic. Morrhia's body was slowly being extricated from the car into the medical aircar docked right next door, but she was beyond saving and everyone around her knew it. The guards' uniforms were splattered with blood and brain matter, and two or three of them were in such shock that whatever Morrhia had told them, it would bear no relevance until a week later. And if they were, say, the sort to drink away a bad experience, then it was twice likely that they would never recall it in full. <br/><br/>Even though Morgan killed for hire, she had an issue with taking lives unnecessarily. <br/><br/>After a moment's deliberation, she came to the conclusion that the guard squad could live. At least for now. If Sigard would get a whiff of it and order them snuffed, then that's a whole other matter. For now, killing them - especially in broad daylight and with witnesses in law enforcement and the coroner's offices alike - was a waste of time and ammo.<br/> <br/>Besides, if Sigard was already ordering the snuff of his co-conspirator, this meant that things were about to get interesting on her home world. <br/><br/>With a grin, Morgan nimbly leapt backwards and landed on a nearby roof. She pulled a square case and a small satchel out of a nearby trash can, methodically disassembled her gun, and snapped the case shut. Knowing no one was watching, she stripped down her tracksuit and pulled a black dress and shoes out of her satchel, and pulled them on. With a quick flare, she incinerated the tracksuit, and stamped out the flames. She slipped the boots that she had worn into the satchel, and hoisted it over her shoulder. <br/><br/>Even despite the square gun case, Morgan Coramus looked like any other young woman out and about, taking care of her day. <br/><br/>Which, quite effectively, she was.<br/></p>

<p>“May I help you?” the receptionist, a matronly woman who looked to have worked here for most of her life, asked without looking up. <br/> <br/>“I’m looking to contest a filed will,” Morrhia said softly. “You will find it filed under the name of Rhyssius LeSarnann.”<br/> <br/>“Let’s see here…” the receptionist typed in a few words, either not registering the name of the deceased, or the person in front of her. “Yes, it’s still in probate. Now, what are you looking to gain? Material goods? Money?”<br/> <br/>“Legacy,” Morrhia said evenly. “I wish to contest the will on the stipulation of succession, through the inheritance laws of the First sector of Rovillus. My name is Morrhia LeSarnann.”<br/> <br/>For the first time, the receptionist looked up and registered Morrhia’s looks. Excepting the eye color and the threads of silver running through her hair, Morrhia did resemble Arriella and Kataria enough to be easily recognizable as their mother. The receptionist’s sudden expression of surprise, with widened eyes and slightly slack mouth, showed Morrhia that the desired effect had worked: she knew exactly who Morrhia was without even needing to refer to the will documentation. <br/> <br/>“Of course,” the receptionist said finally. “Please wait while I consult with the preliminary admissions magistrate.”<br/> <br/>Morrhia nodded politely and folded herself into a waiting chair while the receptionist scurried off to consult. Within minutes, it seemed that the entire office had come alive. A whisper had risen up from the magistrate’s office down the hall, and everyone had craned their necks as much as they could to catch a glimpse of the woman wanting to contest the Emperor’s will. <br/> <br/>They found it curious that she was using her married name, although it was common knowledge within the Courts that the Emperor’s only blood family that stood to inherit was Arriella and Kataria.<br/> <br/>They found it curious that she was dressed so simply; they would have expected the First sector to be on the traditionalist side. <br/> <br/>They found it extra curious that this was happening almost immediately after Rhyssius’s funeral. <br/> <br/>The whispers rose up like an engine humming, and from the looks of a couple of the people in the back, there were some e-mails to be sent out to the society newspapers around the civilized universe. <br/> <br/>Which was exactly what Morrhia was banking on. <br/> <br/>The magistrate didn’t take long to come out, and greeted Morrhia as politely as he was able. He was a portly, aged Hunter, one who had not served in active duty since the days of Shourron I’s rampage, and it showed. His instincts were dulled to the point where Morrhia’s aura was of no difference, and he most certainly was not discerning in the fact that the woman in front of him was, quite succinctly, playing him. <br/> <br/>“Lady LeSarnann,” the magistrate bowed. “Please come with me.”<br/> <br/>Morrhia returned the bow, if only out of formalities and because she knew people were watching her, and followed him down the hall. She did not allow herself to glance back at the office employees, but knew that the real phase one of her plan – the phase that she did not tell Sigard that she was implementing – was on.<br/> <br/>The magistrate led her into his office, and turned on a small camera that faced the guest seats. <br/> <br/>“I will now proceed to do your intake, Lady LeSarnann,” he said. “Answer the questions while looking into the camera. I will not be able to tell you the stipulations of the will that you are contesting, since it is not yet fully approved by the probate. Which, under First-sector legal code, means that you have exactly thirty-five Cosmic days from date of filing to contest it.”<br/> <br/>Morrhia nodded. She knew all of that already. <br/> <br/>“At the end of the intake, I will be able to tell you if your case has merit,” the magistrate continued. “After that, it is in the hands of the Court.”<br/> <br/>“Of course, good sir,” she murmured and sat down.<br/> <br/><i>Steady now, </i>Morrhia thought, feeling the first pinpricks of nerves.<i> You know the law. You know how to argue this. It’s time for action.</i><br/> <br/>“State your full name for the record. Include your maiden name before your marriage as your middle name.” The magistrate spoke as though reading from a script, unaware of who was before him.”<br/> <br/>“Morrhia Kayan LeSarnann.”<br/> <br/>The magistrate was still impassive, ever the judicial figure. “State your place of birth.”<br/> <br/>“I was born midsummer’s eve, in the Sarlaie district of the Eighth Sector.”<br/> <br/>“Who were your parents and other family members?”<br/> <br/>“My father was a farmer in the Sarlaie district. He owned twenty acres, which he had used for livestock. My mother was a battalion sergeant in the Rovillian Guard for the Eighth sector. My elder sister had resigned from the Political Academy in order to get married. Presently, I don’t know her whereabouts.”<br/><br/>“Please state your relationship to the decedent.”<br/><br/>Morrhia took in a deep breath and let it out, and for the briefest of moments, it looked as though the topic was extremely difficult for her to discuss. “I am his former wife and the mother of his two children.”<br/><br/>“Please state the legal basis for your intercession with the last will and testament probate process.”<br/><br/>“Under First sector inheritance statute 12, property transfer bylaw 91, the property and the Crown passes to the surviving spouse before the child. Seeing as I am as of yet alive, it is my belief that I have basis to stand claim for the transfers that Lord Emperor Rhyssius LeSarnann had stipulated.”<br/><br/>The magistrate was suddenly surprised. She had stated the precise law that dictated property transfers within family. He knew about the LeSarnann last will and testament, but the probate court had absolutely no one contesting it…until now. <br/><br/>“Who will be representing you in court?”<br/><br/>Morrhia’s gaze was suddenly steely. “I shall be representing myself.”<br/><br/>The magistrate nodded, and switched the camera off. “Very well. Lady LeSarnann, seeing as you are well-acquainted with the jurisprudence affiliated with property transfers, I see it fit that your case may proceed onwards. The court will send notifications to the remaining surviving family of the deceased, and you will all appear in court the following week, first day at ten in the morning by the first sun’s measure. Kindly observe that only the pre-defined family members are permitted to adorn themselves with traditional regalia, and that the will shall be read in relevant portions only at the first proceeding. It is important that you are not late.”<br/><br/>Morrhia nodded. “I won’t be. Thank you, good sir.”<br/><br/>“And most importantly, kindly make sure that you have your defense carefully prepared,” the magistrate advised. “It isn’t often that this court sees a probate contestation case with a pro se representation.”<br/><br/>Morrhia nodded again. “Of course.”<br/><br/>The magistrate bowed again and showed her out. This time, however, Morrhia took the back way out of the court building. She had passed the first test of getting her case taken seriously. Now it was time to prove that she could hold her own in the case of ambition versus rights, and it was doubly interesting if she were to consider that she had not seen the contents of the will. <br/><br/>She knew one thing: by the end of today, there would be quite a little stir in the First sector as the summons to court would be delivered.<br/></p>

<p>“Happy one month until plugging in!”<br/><br/>Piper watched in frozen terror as her father, Carlton Semmin, lifted his frosted glass of cloudy water in a toast. Carlton chuckled, proud of the reaction he received from his daughter, and placed the cup back on the small square table. <br/><br/>“Don’t be so worried, Pipe. Plugging in is an exciting time in any teenager’s life.”<br/><br/>“You’re spouting Ward propaganda, Dad,” Piper pointed out, stabbing a piece of semi-wilted lettuce on her fork. She shoved the whole thing into her mouth. Piper knew that though her father tolerated Piper’s anti-Ward philosophies, he disagreed with them wholeheartedly. As a low-level employee of the Hamilton Ward Corporation for Technological Advancement, referred to as WardTech among its fans and WardCorp among everyone else, Piper’s father religiously called his employer WardTech.<br/><br/>“Don’t eat too fast.” Carlton cut his piece of lettuce into quarters and nibbled on one corner. “Give the enzymes time to process.” <br/><br/>She chewed her tech-enhanced lettuce slowly, staring at her father, waiting for him to spout a lecture about Piper’s choice of words. When nothing came, Piper tried goading him.<br/><br/>“Plugging in is just a tool, you know,” she said, pushing the small piece of nondescript, lifeless protein around on her plate. Even generous amounts of ketchup couldn’t mask the taste. And Piper loved ketchup. “A tool used by Ward to brainwash his minions. Do you know there was a time when humans didn’t have to plug in? A time when these” — Piper held up her wrist, showing her father the small metal circle inset in her skin — “were completely unnecessary.”<br/><br/>“And where did you hear this?” Carlton asked pleasantly.<br/><br/>“I read about it.”<br/><br/>Her father paused. “On your holo, right? You didn’t somehow manage to find—“<br/><br/>Piper shook her head, cutting off Carlton. “No, Dad, I haven’t managed to find a real book.” She rolled her eyes, using the tip of her fork to draw letters on her plate. “But one of these days, I will. I’ll read an actual ink-and-paper book.”<br/><br/>“Now you’re spouting propaganda,” Carlton said, his voice sharp. “Wood pulp was outlawed and you know that.”<br/><br/>Piper’s fork clattered to her plate and her gaze and hands fell to her lap.<br/><br/>“Don’t pick your nails.”<br/><br/>Piper placed her hands, palms down, back on the kitchen table.<br/><br/>He was right, but that didn’t stop Piper from craving it. She had read about how wood pulp paper felt in your hand, the way it produced a smell, a taste, a texture. But she knew that she’d never get to feel it firsthand. After the final wave of radiation drove humanity into quarantine pods, all natural material was deemed unstable and outlawed. That included books.<br/><br/>“But ignoring that,” Carlton went on, popping the last item on his plate into his mouth, “I want to tell you something.”<br/><br/>Piper looked at her father, eyes wide. Lecturing Piper about her love of everything obsolete was one of his favourite past times; if he was passing up that opportunity, Piper knew he was going to say something good.<br/><br/>“A curious thing happened at work today.”<br/><br/>He had her full attention.<br/><br/>“I probably shouldn’t be telling you this at all, given your opinions about my employer.”<br/><br/>Piper shook her head, urging him to go on.<br/><br/>“But Hamilton Ward is the reason there is food on your plate and electricity in this apartment.”<br/><br/>Piper nodded. When was he going to get to the good stuff?<br/><br/>“I managed to hack myself into some wormhole, and when I came out the other side I realized I was looking at the plugcast coding.”<br/><br/>Piper’s mouth popped open. <br/><br/>“I recognized it instantly, having worked on it so closely with your—” Carlton paused.<br/><br/>“With my mother,” Piper finished his thought, voice strong. It had been close to five years since her mother passed away, and Carlton still seemed to think Piper wasn’t ready to talk about it.<br/><br/>“Yes.” He paused, scratched at the stubble growing on his chin, and then went on. “But it was different, Pipe.”<br/><br/>“It’s been five years since Mom worked on it. Of course it’ll look different.” She scooped up some ketchup onto her fork and ate it. Her father grimaced at the action. “Wouldn’t Hamilton Ward have updated and enhanced the code? I’d expect so.”<br/><br/>Carlton thought about that. “I suppose. But this seemed… different, somehow. The basic sequence was the same, but there was some sort of addendum at the end that seemed odd to me.”<br/><br/>“Addendum?”<br/><br/>“I started reading it, but didn’t get very far before I was logged out of the system. I guess one of the higher-ups detected the breach.”<br/><br/>“You sound worried.”<br/><br/>“A memo circulated less than half an hour later, Piper. It said that the hacker droids are almost finished, and the A-level hackers are going to start being tested, to see which of us humans are going to be kept.” He ran a hand through his short, near-black hair. “They’re letting off half of us, Piper. To be replaced by machines.”<br/><br/>Piper frowned, still unsure how this connected with what her father saw. <br/><br/>“If the D-levels find out that I was the one who breached the security, I’m definitely going to be on the half being let off.”<br/><br/>Fury exploded in Piper’s heart. “You were doing your job, Dad! That’s exactly what your job is. You hack into their system to find where it’s weak. If you were able to get into the plugcast code, then that’s a serious problem for WardCorp! They should be promoting you, not letting you go!”<br/><br/>Carlton’s shoulders sagged. “I don’t know, Piper. Whatever I saw… they’re not happy about it. It seems like my accidental breach has been the talk of the company. No one knows it was me. I can cover my tracks incredibly well - that’s one of the reasons I was hired, you know. But whatever that addendum was, it was important. And top-secret. And the D-levels have made it very clear that whoever caused the breach is going to be let go. I’m not speculating, Pipe. They said that outright.”<br/><br/>Piper’s anger deflated and she slumped back in her seat. “So what you’re saying is…”<br/><br/>“Let’s cross our fingers that I pass the testing and my covered tracks stay covered. Because if I’m caught, or if I don’t fly through the testing with flying colours, I’m out of a job.”<br/><br/>So much of Piper and her father’s life was based on that job. They lived in an apartment complex filled with WardCorp employees. Piper’s education was funded through WardCorp. Their food and power allotments were rations delivered from WardCorp. They didn’t live a glamorous life, but it was a comfortable life. And if Carlton Semmin lost his job, he and his daughter would have lost so much more than just a job.<br/><br/>“And we’d be screwed.”<br/><br/>Defeat hung over the room like a fog, weighty and palpable. Piper could feel the resistance in her chest, the tightness of breathing, the beginnings of a panic attack. She swallowed it down and shoved away from the table. Her chair smacked into the wall that was always just a little too close to the edge of the table.<br/><br/>“Piper?”<br/><br/>“I need some air.” <br/><br/>Piper was halfway to the door of their apartment by the time her dad reacted: “But you didn’t finish your dinner.”</p>

<p>Cassie likes to shoplift. But when she steals something that someone else wants, too, it only leads to adventure, danger, and romance.</p>

<p>(From about 4500 words in.)<br/><br/>""Cassie's spot was a playground. The structure had been around for as long as Cassie was alive, but was usually deserted. In her neighbourhood, the houses all had spacious backyards and their own playgrounds. Half the houses had in-ground swimming pools. Cassie had one friend, in elementary school, who had a waterfall in her backyard. The at-home play sets meant that the public playground went unused. It had a faint air of neglect, and that’s why Cassie loved it.<br/><br/>She sat down on one of the three swings and pulled the letter out. She used her legs to rock her lightly, looking down at the small piece of paper in her hand.<br/><br/>She had a pouch full of genuine diamonds and a silent note-writer who wanted them for himself. And while the thought sort of terrified her, it also thrilled her.<br/><br/>“Waiting for it to do a trick?” a voice asked, interrupting her thoughts.<br/><br/>She jumped up and off the swing in a second, jamming the paper back in her pocket. She whirled around.<br/><br/>Standing about twenty feet behind the swing set was a guy completely unfamiliar to Cassie. From that distance, Cassie couldn’t make out what he looked like, but there was something worn and threadbare about his clothes – for clothes, after all, were Cassie’s specialty.<br/><br/>“Who are you?” she asked, staying on her side of the swings.<br/><br/>The mystery man started coming towards her. She kept one hand tightly gripping the swing’s chain, letting the comfortable metal links ground her. <br/><br/>“Just a friendly stranger,” he said. “I’m on your side. We have a mutual enemy.”<br/><br/>“I don’t have enemies,” Cassie replied instantly, coolly.<br/><br/>“Everyone has enemies.” His reply came just as quickly.<br/><br/>They fell silent.<br/><br/>“All right, I’ll bite. Who’s the mutual enemy?”<br/><br/>“The name won’t mean anything to you. But it has to do with a certain item in a certain box in a certain pocket of your knapsack.”<br/><br/>Cassie paled and her grip on the links tightened. “What do you know about that?”<br/><br/>“More than you, I can promise you that.”<br/><br/>He was a mere five feet away at that point, just on the other side of the swing. Cassie took in his features: he was moderately taller than her five-foot-six, with dark hair, worn short and unstyled. He hid it under a gray zip-up hooded sweatshirt, keeping the hood lifted. On top of the sweatshirt was a leather jacket just like the one Jordan wore. Cassie could make out very stong jawline and square chin; high, chiseled cheekbones; and dark eyes under brooding, hooded lids. The whole appearance was of someone well-cut, someone hardened, someone who had long ago lost the softness of youth. And yet Cassie would say that he looked barely older than she.<br/><br/>And while Cassie had no idea who this guy was, and while she had no reason to trust him, she did intrinsically. It was his bad-boy look, she realized with a jolt. It was her curse. She’d always trust a bad boy.<br/><br/>She knew that was backwards, but she didn’t care.""</p>

<p>Jonathan Rothman is hired as an aide by 20ish-term Congressman Morrison Hardy of Harlem. Rothman comes to believe Hardy is engaged in ethically questionable if not illegal behavior. This makes him briefly disillusioned by politics, but he sees that Hardy's method works, not just for keeping him in office, but for actually helping the people in the district. ""A lot of times they don't need anything, just a sense that someone is listening. The politics of the people means I can't sit on a throne somewhere, I have to listen."" When a primary challenger appears, giving Hardy his first fight in close to 2 decades, Rothman thinks ""all right then, I'll go to hell"" and tries to minimize or cover up Hardy's supposed corruption by what turns out to be an illegal act of his own. It comes to light before the primary, and Rothman has to fix the problem he doesn't entirely realize he caused.</p>

<p>When Margaret was in the process of writing her Geology thesis on the Prednizoan salt deposits in the Wisconsin veldt, upon starting her secondary line of argument, which was on page 125 and about halfway into the document as she envisioned it written, she inserted a short aside, inviting her reader – whoever it was, thesis adviser not barred from participation, - to contact her in whatever way they pleased and claim a bottle of Talisker 18 year single malt scotch from her, as a reward for sticking with the argument that long.</p><p>Someone did in fact claim that bottle - three years later. A short, thick-set graying woman that made Margarete think she was facing her future self, about 20 years down the line (wizards not faring terribly well with respect to aging or life expectancy).</p><p>The woman stayed for tea, asked some oddly intrusive questions about Margaret's family (which by that point consisted of one uniquely bratty sister), and left behind a business card with a hand-written phone number on the back which matched none on the front.</p><p>Two days after calling it, Margaret had a job with the Human-Wizard Liaison Office.</p><p>&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;

<p>Solo is sitting on what was once a bed, her back against the wall, pushing shiny brass rounds into a pistol magazine. There’s a second magazine on the mildewed mattress beside her, and a third in the gun on her lap. She doesn’t miss often, but she likes to double-tap, so with nine rounds in each magazine she’s probably got the makings for ten or twelve dead people there.<br/><br/>I’m down to my last magazine and I’m not as good a shot as she is. I might be able to add two or three to the score. It isn’t going to be enough.<br/><br/>Solo’s carbine is leaning against the peeling wall by the window. It’s an ugly, deadly-looking thing, but without ammunition it’s little more than a rather unwieldy club. Under normal circumstances, Solo could kill you nine different ways with an empty gun, but she’s not at her best today. There are rusty brown stains on her black T-shirt and she’s paler than I’ve ever seen her. I cleaned and dressed the wound as best I could, but there are probably still bullet fragments in there and I don’t have the tools or the expertise to do anything about it.<br/><br/>The empty room smells of damp and mold and stale piss. A crumbling wardrobe leans in the corner and smoke marks on the wall testify to more than one attempt to start a fire. It isn’t a place I particularly want to die.<br/></p>

<p>It’s hard being the good, well-mannered princess when your magic’s constantly sparking out of your fingers at the most inopportune times. Like when you’re in the middle of a state dinner.</p><p>This was Karina Ivanov’s reality. And it wasn’t always pretty.</p><p>She was sitting in her bedroom, cuddling the cloth doll she’d had since birth, when her mother entered. Quiet with her hands folded, she approached Karina with the slowness of a woman who’d seen and felt too much. A ghost of a smile traced her parched lips nevertheless. Her love for Karina was still strong.</p><p>“Darling,” she said quietly, sitting on the end of Karina’s bed. “How are you?”</p><p>“I’m fine.” What else could she say? She knew why her mother had come in.</p><p>“Are you ready to go speak to your father?”</p><p><em>Yes, Mother. Of course I’m ready to be lectured again for something that’s never been my fault. </em>She kept her eyes on the doll, fiddling with its loose threads. “Yeah.”</p><p>Her mother’s cold hand clasped her shoulder. Karina tried not to shiver under what felt like the touch of a dead person. Her mother was very much alive. Just sick, her father said. She’d be better soon.</p><p>“Alright then, let’s go.”</p><p>Karina got up, clutching the doll close to her, and took her mother’s hand. She got up with the groan and sighed. “Karina.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You have to leave the doll behind.”</p><p>The doll. The doll that wasn’t <em>just </em>a doll. That’s why he didn’t like it. She sighed and gently placed the doll on the bed, then returned her gaze to her mother. She mustered the best smile she could, took her mother’s hand in hers, and left for her father’s office.</p>

<p>Jenifer Snook should have known things would not work out well for her on her first day of life; when her mother spelt her name wrong. She now sat by the lounge room window, her eyes only just reaching out into the foggy day without their glasses correcting them, pondering her misfortunes and her lack of any real feelings towards them. She was in shock, they said, she’ll get there, they said. Never to her, always around almost closed doors and in quiet, gentle voices. She wondered where she was supposed to get.<br/><br/>Staring out across the street, Snook was glad of her fuzzy eyes and the fog that thickened around their house. She could only make out lumps of things moving around in the windows opposite her tall, three story house. She sat in what before would have been a bedroom, but they had an extra floor and all the levels had moved up one to make room for it. Below her was her brother’s ‘study’. A cold, dusty room, where door was never opened. Snook’s brother had had plans, he had bought this house to achieve things, do things, and then Snook came along and the study door was closed. She looked down at her lap and twiddled the pinky ring that was so big she had to wear it on her thumb. It was battered and nicked on one edge where her father had fallen against a moving saw; it was the ring that caught the blade instead of his finger. He always called it his lucky ring as he thought it had saved his finger from being ripped off and tossed up into the air for a bird to catch and carry away to feed its children. Snook felt that he might have been exaggerating a little, but felt an unerving amount of sympathy for the poor baby birds who didn’t get to eat that day. She did not share this thought with her father. The ring hadn’t really helped in the end, but she always wore it, just in case.<br/><br/>Snook looked back up to the fuzzy houses opposite her. They were normal houses, with the lounge and kitchen downstairs and the bedrooms opposite her. It meant that she could look straight into their bedrooms and down into their kitchens and gardens. Snook was quite nosy and had enjoyed this view when she first went to live with her brother. But she soon tired of it as the people opposite, in all the four houses that linked along the road, did very little. She would stare down into their gardens on the hottest day of the short summer and would never see any of them. She would see cats jump from garden to garden, perch themselves on the fences like huge vultures sitting in lines looking down at the snaking grass and bilious bushes with strange movements and flashes of fur darting inbetween. Now and then they would leap from the fence, sometimes in unison, sometimes alone in an attempt to prove themselves or live up to a dare, and land in the overgrown garden to dissapear into it then reappear with unknown things hanging form their mouths. Snook would watch them for hours in those first weeks, before a well meaning aunt or overbearing social worker convinced her brother that really she should be at school. The cats fascinated her; there were so many, and they didn’t seem to belong to any of the houses, not really. But then, cats never really do. They would watch her too, when she walked back from school, their large, almond eyes fixed on her. But if she went near one of them they would run from her and disapear in an instant.<br/><br/>Snook watched the cats now, little fuzzy shapes darting around, inbetween sniffs and nose wipes and sips of lemonaide. The fog was becoming thicker, and she felt her normal vague worry about her brother coming home intensify, just a little. What would ever happen to her if he died too? The well meaning aunt, she supposed. But Snook liked her brother, although he never really spoke to her. He seemed nice. He was twenty six but he still bought lego. He would sit in the lounge quietly at night and build it, then put the finished models on the many shelves that ran the full length of the lounge on one wall. One day he would fill them all up, and Snook wondered what he would do then. Move, maybe? With her, maybe.<br/><br/>Snook remembered her brother from years ago. He lived with her and mother and father up until Snook was five and he turned twenty. She remembered him as loud, slamming about and dropping things everywhere. He would flash through the house blowing things over as he passed thundering and stomping and making mother cry. One day he was gone and Snook didn’t see him again until their mother and father’s funeral. He was quiet then. He had walked up to her and took her hand and led her away, back to this house, back to the upstairs lounge and locked study door.<br/><br/>Her brother still didn’t talk to her much, it was a week before she discovered his name was Jonathan, as she couldn‘t remember from before, and that was only because a the strange woman next door had knocked on the door and screamed for him. The strange woman next door came round allot, generally because she couldn’t work the back door, or because the fire engine was making noise, or because there were people trapped in her mirror again. Still, Jonathan had met his girlfriend through her. Her name was Jane and she would visit the strange woman next door and cook her lunch, since her oven stopped working (Jane had taken the plug off after the fire engine) and then later to give her some pills. Jane was paid to do this, But Snook still liked her. She made Jonathan smile. He still didn’t talk much but Jane didn’t seem to mind. Jonathan and Jane would cuddle up on the sofa and they would all watch cartoons. It was on the first night that Snook realised how many Js where in the house at once.<br/><br/>Snook liked the lady next door. She was tiny, about the width of her shoes, with fingers like twigglets and funny growths speckling her forehead. She thought Snook was her granddaughter. She gave her polo mints and glass after glass of milk. Jonathan wouldn’t let her have milk because he had once mumbled that she was allergic. Snook was sure he had got her mixed up with someone else. She didn’t really like milk, but the strange woman would smile at her and it was good to drink something she wasn’t supposed to. And she really liked polos. Snook would visit her after school before Jonathan came home and sit listening to what the people in the mirrors where doing that day. Jane said it was because the woman couldn’t recognise herself or what a reflection even was anymore, so she made things up to explain what she saw. Snook once asked what if there where people stuck in her mirrors, wouldn’t Jane feel bad that she hadn’t helped? Jane had looked worried by this, but Jonathan had told her not to worry, that Snook was fine, although what that had to do with people trapped in mirrors, Snook didn’t know.<br/><br/>Right now, Snook was staying in her house, sniffling and coughing and staring out at the houses opposite. The woman next door was also on her own, as Jane had left her two hours ago, but Snook had been warned not to pass on her cold, so she stayed in the high up lounge watching the fog engross the neighbours. She reached over to the little beaten table next to the bright green Ikea chair she was sat cross legged on and without looking she set her fingers off to search for her glasses that she was almost completely sure would be there, somewhere. As her hand slipped over the table top her eyes focused on a blurry figure walking across the top window of the first house  opposite. It was blue, which she knew meant it was wearing something blue, but she enjoyed ignoring this fact and instead seeing a strange monster creeping and juddering around. The blue thing disappeared into the wall again as the window ended, and Snook lazily moved her damaged eyes across the back of the houses. Her hand still couldn’t find the glasses but she was stubborn and would not back down; her hand would find them on their own. Just then the blue thing appeared again, but this time in the top window of the last house. Of course, it was another person with the same coloured top on, just walking around their own bedroom at the same time. It was that. But to her broken eyes it was the same blue monster as in the first house, now sculking around the last one. Her hand searched harder for the glasses and eventually found them precariously leaning over the edge of the table. She grabbed them, knocked them from the table, and was forced to tear her eyes form the blue thing and help her hand search for the now grounded glasses. It took maybe three seconds, but when she looked back to the houses opposite the blue thing was gone, and nothing more could be seen through her broken eyes. She pushed the glasses on and up her nose and her eyes adjusted, bringing the foggy day into stark, grey reality. Through the windows were vague shapes of furniture and dull walls, but no blue, no people. No monsters. There had been a moment, a few seconds, where Snook had thought she had found something remarkable, something out of the grey and foggy day that had stretched on since… was there ever anything but grey and mould and heavy, drab air? Snook could pick out moments, like the blue monster shifting in front of her eyes, or her brother smiling or her mother stroking her hair and plating it over and over. But surrounding those moments, always, was a heavy, stagnant air.<br/><br/>Snook took her glasses off again.</p>

<p> The Queen opened her mouth to continue speaking, but at that moment Arthur noticed something. The automaton behind her had frozen in the act of pouring glasses of wine, and a think stream of smoke was drifting out of its back. Other people started to notice too, and murmurs ran through the guests.</p>
<p>Robin turned, frowning, just as some of the other automatons also began acting strangely. Arthur jumped as one of them dropped the tray it had been holding. Another one began walking backwards and forwards into a table, gaining speed, also beginning to smoke.</p>
<p>‘Ladies and Gentlemen,’ Robin said in a calm but strained voice, ‘I think it would be best if we evacuated the hall, while we fix the problem with the automatons.’</p>
<p>The Queen’s bodyguards stepped forward and she was ushered out of the dining hall. Arthur saw her face, her eyes wide with confusion and fear before she left the hall.</p>
<p>Everyone left was on their feet, the food forgotten in the confusion. The automatons were really out of control now. The one which had dropped its tray had now walked over to the serving counter and was systematically smashing every glass and plate on there, sending food and wine flying. Another had gotten its hand into the serving bowl of soup, and was scrawling words on the walls with it. Arthur could make out ‘Humans first!’, and ‘Humans against automatons!’ before Lady Alice gripped him by the arm and steered him towards the nearest exit.</p>
<p>‘Don’t stand and stare Arthur,’ she said grimly, ‘we have to get out of here now!’</p>
<p>Arthur looked behind her and realised she was right. The automaton which had been smoking slightly now had black clouds billowing out of it’s back, and the whole thing was shaking more violently.</p>
<p>Most of the guests had gotten clear of the room when there was a flash of light and a terrific explosion in the dining room. Everyone was flung to the ground. Arthur lay gasping, the air suddenly filled with smoke and ash. He saw Lady Alice struggling to get to her feet, her face pale. Their eyes met.</p>
<p>‘What on earth was that?’ she hissed.</p>
<p>Arthur swallowed. ‘I rather suspect that that was a bomb.’</p>

<p>The tavern was full, and everyone was watching the woman on stage. She was singing a haunting love song about the war. She was good, the whole tavern had fallen silent since she started, and there was more than one tear in the eye in the audience. She had the trick of making eye contact with someone for a while, so they felt she was singing to them alone. <br/>Her eyes met the busker, and he saw them widen in surprise. Her voice wavered for just a second on a note before she corrected it and carried on. He doubted anyone would have noticed. <br/>She finished her song, left the stage and began to make her way towards the bar. The tavern had advertised a free drink to any performers. It had worked well, <br/>She had to stop several times to accept thanks and compliments from several on her way to the bar, but eventually made it and accepted her glass of the best house red. She kept glancing at the busker.<br/>The busker continued sipping his ale, watching the next act, a harpist, setting up on the stage. <br/>‘Hi’<br/>The busker looked round. The singer was standing right next to him.<br/>‘Can I sit here?’<br/>He shrugged and motioned to the seat across the table from him. <br/>She ignored him and took the seat next to him.<br/>‘Ok, look, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I know you.’<br/></p>

<p>Lurking between life and death is a city called Moribund. Its inhabitants are those who know they are about to die, those choking out their last breath, feeling their lungs fill with water, or staring down an oncoming train. Very few ever return from a trip there, though the magical city is nice enough - and the situation they left terrifying enough - that none really want to. Most of those that do leave usually forget, like a dream on waking.<br/><br/>Simon Pearce, however, remembers Moribund after the encounter with a sleeping lorry driver he barely escaped with his life. He remembers the bright carnival, the myriad stalls and the seemingly impossible architecture. But mostly he remembers the jester girl, and the kiss they shared. He dismisses it as a dream, until one day in a quiet public library, reading a well-thumbed copy of Pride and Prejudice, he finds someone else who remembers.<br/><br/>And now, together, they'll do anything to get back.</p>

<p>It was cold, sitting there with Jen on the station bench, under the alienating neon light. I never liked being on small stations after dark; there was always something sinister about them, with the sporadic lighting and graffiti in unlikely places. The weird reflections in the puddles from the earlier rain didn't help calm me either, not least because of the potential slipping hazard.<br/><br/>Jen seemed to be less bothered, and was actually smiling. The station was also exactly what we had been looking for, so that had worked out well. One line going through it, with a little walk way for maintenance or something on the opposite side for us to jump over to. And small enough that more trains went through without stopping than not. It was about eleven pm now, and we were the only people there, and expected it to stay that way.<br/><br/>We'd been sitting there for about a quarter of an hour, in silence. I think we were both summoning the force of will to do something so obviously stupid. I know I was.<br/><br/>""Let's go."" Jen said finally, and stood up. I looked up at her, still uncertain. I don't know why I resisted; the look on her face was obviously set on the task now, and it had been my idea originally. I was mostly thinking that I hadn't updated my last note, and I was worried it might not make sense now. Obviously I'm updating it now, but it wouldn't be long before I got plenty of evidence it needed to be done. Not this time, but the one after this.<br/><br/>After a few seconds under the gaze, I gave up and stood.<br/><br/>To my surprise, she reached out and grasped my hand, her smile perking again. A hurried explanation followed, ""To make sure we jump at the same time, and that nothing goes wrong."" I nodded, and gave a small smile back. She's a much more touch-y feel-y person than me, and I wasn't really used to it just yet. It was a good idea, though.<br/><br/>I took a stop forwards, but was immediately held back by Jen's hand. I looked back to her confused, and she seemed to be distracted, staring off into the distance. ""Come on, you wanted to go,"" I said, trying to make light of it, though the tension I was feeling probably did slip into my voice more than I really wanted it to.<br/><br/>She looked back and nodded faintly, seeming more hesitant now than she had a moment before. I wondered if she was having doubts about how sensible this whole this was.<br/><br/>""We're like early pilots, or astronauts, you know?"", I suggested, with a faint laugh, uncertainty evident again. ""I mean, well, it's a bit dangerous, but once we show everyone we'll be famous. Like the Wright Brothers.""<br/><br/>A little smile appeared on her lips, and she replied, ""Or like the Curies."" I wasn't sure who they were at the time, but I've looked it up since and they won a Nobel prize together or something. For discovering radiation. In retrospect, I'm not sure it was the most appropriate analogy, since their discovery killed them both. Or maybe it was a bit too appropriate, or had potential to be. Either way, the readiness which she came to it was a bit unsettling. If I'd know what she was talking about at the time, I probably wouldn't have jumped.<br/><br/>She gave one last nod then, glancing off to the right one more before stating firmly. ""On the count of three. One..."" The moments between the numbers seemed like years, as I tried to focus on running and making sure I didn't fall. I couldn't afford to fall. ""Two..."" I tensed, and squeezed her hand gently. ""Three.""<br/><br/>And we ran forward, straight for that edge, under which was was more than enough electricity to kill both of us instantly, and a large enough drop that scrambling up if we didn't make and didn't die would take long enough for being hit by a train to be a real possibility. It was only after my feet left the ground that I noticed the light hit me in the side of the head, and I realised what the hesitation had been all about. There was a train coming, and she knew it. I felt my heart skip a beat as it hit me how we were just about to die because we had chosen to something so incredibly stupid as jump over train tracks in front of a speeding train.<br/><br/>While I wasn't too happy at the time, I have to admit now that Jen did a pretty good job with this one.<br/><br/>I closed my eyes as I felt my entire chest clench. I know I was in the air for maybe a second at most, but with the light of the train and the certainty of what was about to happen ringing in my head, time might as well have stopped. The fear hit me as hard as the train was about to.<br/><br/>And then I landed on the ground, still with my hand in Jen's. The breath I didn't know I was holding was released as part almighty sigh and part hysterical laugh as I came to conclusion I was still alive. But when I opened my eyes, I realised I wasn't lying on the cold, damp concrete of the other platform. I was on warm dirt, under a bright sun. We were in Moribund.</p>

And, for Chris Stuart, an angel.<br/><br/>The young student can't believe his luck with the woman that has dropped into his world, though whether that luck is good or bad he can't decide. Either way, she is eager to redeem herself and return to heaven, and leave again as soon as she had entered. However, a beautiful woman will always attract attention, even when she doesn't have a twelve foot wingspan, and so learning to live on this alien world is the first order of business, and neither can be rid of the other too soon.

<p>A few minute later, he and Anaëlle were standing in the centre of the street, with the angel giving him and entirely uncertain look. ""And this process that you're describing is called a 'snow angel'?""<br/><br/>""Yes!"", Chris answered cheerfully, before carefully kneeling down and sprawling out on his back, arms outstretched. Swinging them up and down, he swept out an area of snow, creating the wings either side of his impression in the snow. Once done, he stood up again, careful not to disturb the pattern. Turning to the angel, he asked quickly, ""See, it's like an angel, with the wings from the side.""<br/><br/>The non-snow angel was still looking entirely dubious over the sight of the humanoid shape in the snow, and the makeshift wings he had created. After a moment more, she carefully tugged off her coat, holding it out to Chris. She turned about, revealing her dark, backless jumper and the bare back it failed to hide which, in the cold, appeared almost as pale as the snow beneath their feet.<br/><br/>""Please hold my coat for a few minutes,"" she requested, and Chris obliged, curious to see where this was going.<br/><br/>Anaëlle took a quick look along the desolate street, moving a little distance along the road into an open patch before simply letting herself fall backwards, arms spread wide. Chris, in turn, jerked forwards as though to catch her, despite her being several metres ahead and him having no chance to reach her before she smacked into the pavement, cracking her skull or giving herself concussion or any of the hundred things that were running through his head as he watched her fall.<br/><br/>However, as she fell, slowly coming closer to the tarmac, a pure white billowed out from her back, her gigantic wings showing themselves once again. In an instant they reached their full span, slowing and, when she finally hit, cushioning her fall. And there she lay, flush to the ground, staring up and smiling at Chris, with the snow beneath left with the impression of a true angel.</p>

<p>Harry's life from Lily's POV starting from the time she is killed by Voldemort. </p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/lorelaisquared/novels/unknown-195293/stats,November 2012,"
<p>There are many terrible things in the world, but perhaps none as horrific as dying before your own children when you know they still need you. I speak from experience as a mother of a one year old who just breathed her last breath in an attempt to save my child from the greatest evil our world has ever known. It was strange really, one minute I was standing there, in front of Harry’s crib, hiding him from Voldemort’s view, and the next everything suddenly went dark and still. A moment after that I was standing over my own dead body and watching in horror as Voldemort aimed a curse at my son. I cried out, but clearly no one could hear me, and given how he’d just killed me, I don’t think he would have cared if he had anyway. Everything seemed to move in slow motion as I watched the green light shoot out of his wand toward Harry, who was crying. <br/><br/>I ached to run to him, to gather him into my arms, to take him away from here and protect him forever, but instead I was completely helpless, just standing there watching in horror as my son, whom I loved more than life itself, screamed. I saw movement out of the corner of my eye near the doorway and my heart sank. It was James, my husband. Only at the same time, it wasn’t James. He wasn’t a ghost exactly, and I didn’t think I was either - otherwise Voldemort would have seen us, but he, like me was still here and I saw the pain in his eyes as he stared open mouthed at my still body. His eyes met mine sadly and together we turned back to our son as the killing curse reached him. <br/><br/>I choked on a sob. I was wrong, watching your child die is far worse than anything I could have imagined. Then, suddenly, a miracle happened. There was a flash of light and Harry continued to cry as the energy from the spell shot backward towards Voldemort. The sound coming from Voldemort was inhuman and terrible, but at the same time he seemed to be shrinking or something. I couldn’t tell exactly what, it all happened so fast, and then before I knew it there was a mist of black and Voldemort was gone. <br/></p>

<p>Prologue<br/><br/>I don't care who you are, the Time Lord victorious is wrong!<br/><br/>The words rang through his mind, the impact of them hitting him more forcefully now than they had a moment before. His eyes widened in horror and he slumped against the TARDIS, needing it to support him as his knees weakened.<br/><br/>What had he done?<br/><br/>Slowly he turned, sensing the Ood before actually seeing it. And he knew.<br/><br/>""I've gone too far."" His entire being lurched at the realization, and he sank to his knees in the cold, unforgiving snow.<br/><br/>He stared at the Ood, terrified. ""Is this it? My death?""<br/><br/>The Ood merely blinked at him and he felt both of his hearts stop for an instant. He was done. It was over, all of it.<br/><br/>""Is it time?"" His shout sounded desperate in the quiet of the night.<br/><br/>The Ood vanished then, and the Doctor stood, still reeling from the shock of it. With shaking hands he let himself into the TARDIS. For several long moments he stared at the console, lost in thought as the cloister bell began to toll.<br/><br/>He'd gone against everything he believed in, everything he'd stood for. And for what? Now he'd never see the people he loved again. He winced in pain as he thought of them. Of Jack whom he'd once abandoned. Of Rose whom he'd loved, lost, found and lost again. Of Martha whom he'd wronged in so many ways. Of Donna. Wonderful Donna who'd done such amazing things but didn't, couldn't ever remember...<br/><br/>""No!"" he cried suddenly, springing into action.<br/><br/>He moved quickly, his fingers flying over gadgets, flicking and twirling buttons and knobs as he frantically programmed the TARDIS.<br/><br/>This wasn't the end. It couldn't be.<br/><br/>He made the rules now and he wouldn't allow it.<br/></p>

I don’t know about you two, but I want to find out how good this local beer is.”<br/><br/>Twenty minutes later, Imogen found out that it was gratifyingly good. Rex seemed to appreciate it, too; the first can hardly touched the sides of his throat.<br/><br/>“Everything okay, Ms Charfield?” he said as he tossed the empty can in the direction of the waste paper basket. It hit the edge, and bounced off onto the floor. Imogen reached for it and put it in the bin.<br/><br/>“Yeah, yeah, Rex. Everything’s okay. If that, earlier, was the worst thing any of us says to another during this location session, we’ll be doing good.”<br/><br/>Jemima finished her can as well. “You’re lagging, Immie.”<br/><br/>“I don’t drink a lot of beer.”<br/><br/>“Well, for someone who doesn’t drink a lot of beer, you picked a good one for them of us as do.” Jemima picked up a second can and toasted Imogen with it. “We’re going to make this bloody show, you two, and we’re going to get back on the bloody bandwagon and come back from this little dip. It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done it.” She sipped from the can and looked pensively at her staff. “Did I ever tell you about how comedy is a big pile of shit?”<br/><br/>The sudden obscenity took Imogen by surprise, and she raised an eyebrow. “No,” said Rex. “No, you didn’t.”<br/><br/>“Well, it is.” Jemima sipped beer again. “It’s not just a big pile, it’s a pile with steep sides. And every comedian there is out there, every one from the amateurs doing open mike stand-up nights to the pros getting paid seven figures for prime time, is trying to climb up that pile of shit. You see, because the sides of the shitheap are so steep,” Jemima went on, “ if you don’t keep climbing, if you stop for even a few seconds, you slide back down. If you do keep climbing, sometimes you’ll put your hand on a loose turd, and you’ll get off balance, and you’ll slide back down some, anyway. Some people get fed up of climbing, fed up with getting shit all over their hands and their clothes, and they walk away. Some people are too determined, or just too daft, to stop, and they keep struggling and struggling. Some people,” she continued, with a wry smile whose significance was not lost on Imogen, “get too old to climb properly, but because they’ve been climbing the shitheap all their lives, they keep on going because they’ve forgotten, or they’ve never known, how to do owt else. And you know the worst part? If you’re one of the few who is lucky enough to climb all the way to the top, you realise you’re still standing ankle deep in shit, and all you can smell is shit, and all you can see around you are people who are jealous of you because you’re on top of the shit where they want to be, and if they can grab your ankles and pull you off the shitheap and right back down to the bottom, they bloody well will. Welcome to the shitheap. Cheers,” she concluded, and took another drink of her beer,<br/><br/></p>

<p>Darroll was about to take the hint when Murphy was interrupted again. ""Hey!"" came a bellow from behind him, and a hand reached round Murphy's head from behind. Startled, Murphy dropped his textbook, the pages flipping in the breeze as he was pulled backward with one hand while his assailant's other hand jammed something white and fabric into his face.</p>
<p>""Hey! Murphy! Does this smell like chloroform to you?"" Ed Crowe, of course. That least endearing of combinations ever, a bully who thought he was also a stand-up comic. As a bully he was a lousy comedian, but unfortunately, as a comedian he was a pretty effective bully. His simpering girlfriend was behind him, Patsy Young. She giggled, which was pretty much all she ever did. Go round with Crowe and giggle at his jokes. Darroll sometimes wondered if Crowe had sex with her, or if he was too dim to know what to do with her. Or too much in love with himself to want to.</p>
<p>Murphy tore himself away and rolled over onto his hands and knees. As he tried to get up, Crowe gave him a shove. It knocked Murphy sideways, but Murphy was agile and managed to twist out of it and regain his feet. Darroll took a couple of steps to stand by him, and immediately realised that he'd made a mistake; he'd drawn Crowe's attention to him as well.</p>
<p>""Oh hey, Murf, you got your lover-boy to protect you too?"" snorted Crowe. A few more people began to gather, the way they always gathered when it looked like there might be a fight. Vultures. They wouldn't fight themselves but they wanted to see blood.</p>
<p>""Too bad I couldn't have you, Crowe,"" snapped back Murphy. ""Martock's too much of a pencilneck for me. I just adore big muscular fellows like you."" And he puckered up his lips.</p>
<p>Christ, thought Darroll. There is going to be murder done here. Murder right here in the yard of Isidor Straus High School, and oh the irony, it isn't going to be me doing the murder, I thought if there was ever a murder in this goddamn school it would be me but --</p>
<p>For once Crowe was lost for a witticism. He opened his mouth once or twice and nothing came out. Nobody else said anything either; it was as quiet as a funeral, the funeral that Joe Murphy was going to be attending in the star role, the one he'd just dug his own grave for.</p>

Everyone is afraid. The only thing the victims seem to have in common is that none of them are conventionally attractive.

<p>Amalthea stands outside the unlit entrance to “The Pit” and breathes in the cool, pre-dawn air. One hand brushes her wild curls from her mouth and tucks them behind her ear. They spring back across her cheek immediately, untameable.<br/>As her skin acclimatises she draws jacket sleeves over her rich, honey-coloured arms. It is her post-work ritual: the time when she simply is a human being, not a human doing.<br/>A movement at the edge of her vision attracts her attention. She turns toward the shadowy alley where the night club bins are stored. Her direct gaze doesn’t reveal any animal or person skulking in the darkness, watching, waiting for her to leave, but her mind creates a sinister shape anyway. For the past six weeks the evening news has continually hinted at unnatural deaths city-wide and rumours of a modern day Jack the Ripper are rife. Now every alleyway has become hostile territory and every shadow a killer, preparing to strike.<br/>Her meditative moments of simply being, stolen by fear of the impenetrable darkness, Amalthea decides to button her coat and get moving. Home isn’t far away, a mere ten minute walk and at four am most of the drunks are already home, sleeping it off, or standing, unsteadily in taxi queues for their chariots to return them safely to their beds. In fact, that was one thing that could be said about fear of the dark. It was good for business.<br/>Gentle but pervasive drizzle bejewels her eyelashes and vainly attempts to flatten her hair. Street lights mutate into dancing constellations and pavements are dotted with quicksilver puddles. Amalthea’s boots leak and the liquid makes her toes squelch. Sucking and dripping sounds mask the noise of her footsteps and the perfectly matched slapping of shoe leather behind her. Of course, when she glances back, the street is empty, but the moment she faces forward she can feel his presence behind her, as always, matching her stride. He is the shadow from which she flees, unseen but perceived through all her other senses, making her hairline tingle. The man who isn’t there.<br/>She used to tell her friends, but now only mentions this deep, primal knowledge to her diary, bored by dismissive scoffing. She wonders whether his other victims were also disbelieved until their vacated shells were discovered. For a moment she considers why she has given this disembodied threat a male gender then shakes her head. Serial killers are almost always male, aren’t they? The one who kills me will probably be male too.<br/>Her scalp itches. Realising the utter pointlessness of another backwards glance, she balls her fists and marches onwards. Just five more minutes and she can lock the darkness outside, for what it’s worth.</p>

<p>We All Fall Down<br/><br/>The year is 2015. <br/><br/>Several months ago London was struck by an earthquake which ripped open the ground. <br/><br/>Legions of evil spirits were released from their resting places in the earth and have taken over the country. Britain is essentially cut off from the world and the population is rapidly dying out. <br/><br/>Rian Monow is living 200 miles north of the centre of the blast site, forced into a leadership role she doesn’t want and a mothering role to twelve year old Emily that she doesn’t feel. She just wants to be left alone and dreams of the spirits taking her soul. But she doesn’t have that sort of choice. <br/><br/>This is the story of the creatures that 'quake unearthed, and how one group of survivors find themselves fighting for their lives in a post apocolyptic world.<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Wonderland<br/><br/>Alice wakes up in the centre of a giant maze. She is approached by two strangers who introduce themselves as Hatter and Doormouse. They tell her the rules of the maze. One: you must only refer to yourself by the name on your tag. Two: if you can get out alive, you can go free. <br/><br/>Josh wakes up in the middle of a path, lined with tall bushes. He is lying next to a man dressed in black with a white club on his chest. Josh is told he is a Playing Card. There are rules. One: he is only allowed to refer to himself by the number and suit on his tag. Two: the only way he can go free is if he kills his prey, who's name is printed on the other side of his tag. <br/><br/>Let the games begin. </p>

Beethoven wants to find them, to bring her mother back from the dead. She already knows one of these stones exist – as her mother handed Beethoven a green diamond with her last breath. Even though Beethoven does not know how or why her mother had one of the stones, she is determined to bring her back if it means she can find out.<br/>Along the way, she meets The Jack – a trader who after finding out she has one of the fabled stones tags along to help her. The Jack knows more about magic than most and can help them.<br/>She also meets Simon, a boy from Earth. Simon has no idea how he got to this world of Carlione, the last thing he can remember is being stabbed by a drunkard in an alleyway in London, and now he suddenly finds himself in a world filled with faeries, magic and girls with names like Beethoven. Simon does not know if he’s really here, in a coma or worse, but he thinks if he can find these stones, surely they will be able to take him home.<br/>However, it may not matter that Simon does not know how he got to Carlione, if the Monarchy got hold of him, he could be hanged without trial, unless he can prove he was bought to Carlione against his will and did not travel there through a portal like the travellers of old.<br/></p>

<p>He knew exactly what it was, exactly what it looked like and at the same time he had no idea. It shimmered and shifted under his gaze, he wasn’t sure if he was blinking and it was different animal each time? Or if he was watching it change before his eyes. It changed appearance with every sleeping breath. It was a panther with sleek black fur and sharp long claws, no a lion with its ragged mane around its face like a pillow. Now a tiger, its bold stripes imprinting themselves on Simon’s eyes, so he was certain it was and always had been a tiger, but it changed again into something with wings and Simon could not be sure he had ever truly seen it as a tiger, even though the stripes still burned bright in his mind. All he knew for sure about the creature was it was beautiful. Breathtakingly beautiful. That beauty made it all the more terrifying. Whatever form it took, or seemed to take to Simon’s eyes did not belie its powerful nature. Even while it was sleeping, Simon was sure this creature could and would kill on sight. He moved closer towards it, as if in a trance, he trod on a twig which snapped beneath his feet. That’s when the creature started to stir.<br/></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Seric stared at the sunlight filtering through his curtains for quite some time before he realised he was awake. He couldn't remember the dream, but to have unconsciously slipped into a trance meant it had been particularly strong. Such dreams were omens, he knew, but this time he felt it had been more than that, much more, and that feeling deeply worried him. Sighing, he reached for the jug resting on his bedside table and drank, willing the deep headache to disappear.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Abruptly, a hollow thump resounded in the tower, signalling that someone was at the door. Wondering what fate had delivered unto him, Seric slicked back his hair with the remaining water and pulled on an only slightly rumpled shirt before making his way down the several dozen stone steps that led to the base of the tower.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Although the door was heavy and old it swung open easily at Seric's touch, but he was completely unprepared for what was on the other side.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> ""Hello Sair,"" Keruni said.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Seric took a step backwards and then winced as his heel hit the wall with a thud. ""Keruni,” he breathed, gingerly rubbing at his foot. “Well, I guess you'd better come in.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> She stepped over his threshold with a laugh. ""I didn't think magicians could be startled so easily.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Keruni. It hadn't been nearly long enough, Seric decided as a slew of sweltering emotions ploughed their way to the forefront of his mind. Even though the hooded green riding cloak covered almost every inch of her down to the tooled leather of her boots, the teasing voice was impossible to mistake, or forget. ""Come, I’m sure you can find somewhere to sit while I make my breakfast,"" he said curtly, hobbling a little as he moved down the hallway to the large room that served as the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Keruni pushed her hood back, revealing dark chestnut hair, and looked around. ""You've done well for yourself,"" she remarked, her eyes noting the smooth red carpet that covered the stairs and hallway.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> ""I had a good head start,"" Seric said softly over his shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> ""So I gathered,"" Keruni said, lightly fingering a small tapestry as she passed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Seric moved to the stove and shuffled the wood pile before lighting it to heat some water for his oatmeal. Keruni reversed a chair and sat on it, laying her arms over the top and resting her chin on them. ""You used to hate cooking, if I remember,"" she said after watching him for a few moments.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Seric shrugged, though a smile played about his lips. ""It happens now and again with boys, I’m told. Although that's something I have yet to look forward to."" He chuckled and shook his head. ""So, when are you going to tell me why you're here?""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Keruni made a wry face. ""All right,"" she sighed, ""I need your help.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> ""What's in it for me?"" Seric asked calmly as he stirred the oatmeal.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Keruni blinked and sat up. ""That's all?""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> ""Don't get me wrong,” Seric said, spooning the oatmeal into a bowl, “I just like to get my motives defined from the outset."" He tapped the pot and looked questioningly at Keruni, who shook her head. “I've gotten into a little bit of trouble with that over the years, so these days I like to be a little more careful,” he said as he sat down and began to eat. His eyes flickered to a fresh groove in the wood, before returning to her.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> ""That makes sense,"" Keruni agreed, but her eyes narrowed. Yes, it did make sense, but it seemed too cool for Seric, too rationed. There was something behind his words, something deeper that she could not fathom, and that bothered her. Perhaps he was no longer the man she had known.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> There was a moment of silence, then Seric made a face. ""So what do you need help with?"" he asked around a mouthful, ignoring his own advice in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Keruni carefully concealed a smile. ""I need to find something.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> ""Wouldn't a Seer be better?"" Seric asked with one cocked eyebrow.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Keruni shook her head. “Unfortunately, the Seers couldn't tell me where the item is, only what it was called - Esahl.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Seric's grin was sly. ""You don't know what it is either, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Keruni shook her head again. “I only know what I need it for.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> “So you have no idea where it is, what it is, and you only have a name to go by?” Seric laughed. “Ah, I’ve missed you, Ker. Only you would set off on an errand like this."" Seric rubbed at the stubble under his chin and waved a hand to forestall Keruni's protest. ""But I'll give you a reading anyway, how could I do any less for an old friend?""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Keruni smiled slightly. ""Thank you, Seric. That means a lot to me.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Seric didn't ask the glaring question but instead concentrated on finishing his oatmeal. He looked up at the last mouthful with a mischievous smile. ""You'll have to give me something, though.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Keruni hesitated before answering, ""Yes?""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> ""A kiss,"" Seric ventured, then laughed heartily at the surprise painted on Keruni's face. ""Ah Ker, that look is payment enough,” he chortled, and standing, negligently flicked his bowl into the sink. “Come then, let's see what the winds whisper.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Keruni smiled to herself as she picked up her knapsack and her sword. Perhaps Seric hadn't changed as much as she had thought.</span></p>

<p>Seric slipped off the horse and handed the reins to Keruni. “I can't see much in this light, maybe there's a better way.” He twisted his spear, the rings beginning to spin. Nakeje looked on with interest.<br/> “You said you were too tired.” Keruni reminded him.<br/> “This won't take much effort.” Seric replied, then closed his eyes and slipped into his natural element. He liked the wind. It was true the wind could be a smell or a taste, a sound or a visage, a feeling or a thought, but what he really liked about it was the way it flowed. The way it travelled and visited places he'd never seen or heard of, the way it filled everything and anything and was free to race above the clouds and down in the dark depths. The flow was one of the first things he'd understood, one of the things he'd been using at the very start of their journey, but unlike that day upon his tower he wasn't calling the wind from half a world away, he was simply letting it flow from around him, letting it whisper the feel of the trees and the land to him. Unbidden in his mind the image rose of a sheltered glade, the grass springy and soft in the shadow of a small rise, the moonlight dappling on a small pool that bubbled between two rocks beside it. He turned without effort and pointed to the north east. “This way, there is a clearing with water for the horses.” He told them, relaxing and letting go of the flows.<br/> Keruni caught Seric as he collapsed to the ground. “He's out cold.” She said with a sigh and a shake of her head.<br/> Tannik returned and they found the glade without difficulty, though setting up the camp proved a longer undertaking since all of them but Nakeje were tired. To expedite their task they made do with a lean-to, since the weather had largely proved to be mild. Tannik set about preparing a meal while Noiya fed and groomed the horses and Keruni disappeared to scout the area and brush out their tracks. Nakeje groomed his own horse and checked on Garrin, then sat and stared at the fire, his eyes dispassionately reflecting the flames.<br/> After a moment, Nakeje spoke, his eyes lingering on Seric's sleeping form. “He wears a curious amulet,” Nakeje said slowly. “Where did he get it?” The Storm-Stone had fallen out of Seric's shirt and lay on his chest, the clouds sweeping languidly across the surface. Kea landed on the lean-to, his weight making the structure shiver slightly.<br/> “He made it.” Tannik replied, stirring the soup slowly. Nakeje's intake of breath was light, but audible. “I know what you are thinking, Solus.” Tannik continued. “But it is true. He seems to hold incredible power, and yet very simple things are beyond him.”<br/> Nakeje's pale eyes regarded Tannik intently. “You see much, wanderer.”<br/> “I have travelled much, Solus.” Tannik replied ladling out a bowl of soup and handing it to him.<br/> Nakeje took the bowl and sniffed at it, his eyes closing as he took in the smell. Eschewing a spoon, he put the bowl to his thin lips and sipped it slowly as if it were a tisane. His eyes showed his appreciation, but he said nothing.<br/> Keruni returned and took over of the grooming of the draft horse, her lanky frame giving her much easier reach than Noiya, who sat down to eat. Keruni checked on Seric briefly then ate herself, suddenly ravenous. Soon their heads were nodding and stacking the bowls away, they sought their beds. Nakeje stayed by the fire, and Keruni looked at him questioningly. He nodded his head to the side and blinked languidly.<br/> “I'll take the second shift.” Tannik muttered. “Noiya, do you mind the third?”<br/> “I'll take it.” Keruni said.<br/> Tannik shook his head. “Not this time. You and Seric have been doing all the work up until now.”<br/> “You can trust me.” Noiya said firmly.<br/> Keruni sighed tiredly, then smiled. “Well, never let it be said I protested against sleep.” She climbed into her bedroll next to Seric and lay down, resting her hand lightly against his. By the time her eyes closed she was asleep.</p>

<p>Alright, since I suppose anyone who checks out my synopsis deserves to actually see something...<br/><br/>This story is my fantasy. It's what I've always thought about, what I've always dreamt of, and what's always on the horizon... just around the corner. It's the blink, the quiet days, the wind in the trees. It's a lamp flickering, it's a dark doorway, it's everything unseen. It's the world I have been dreaming of forever, and never writing.<br/><br/>Because it's that one thing, it's where you suddenly notice something isn't quite right. It's that day that for some reason it's too quiet...but a silent, hidden, <em>something</em> is waiting around the corner. Something electric and inspiring, something that will take you away just like you've always wanted. Something that will tell you finally, irrevocably that the world you dream of can be, and is, real.<br/><br/>This story has no path, right now, and is about a man who will drop everything to chase a dream. To take that chance and fly away. This story is about a man called Caid, and an adventurer called Foxfire. This story is about walking forward when you have the chance, and daring to believe it will work out. Daring to believe it won't be all bad.<br/><br/>Daring to believe that dreams can come true.<br/><br/>And biscuits. Preferably ginger ones.</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/ikalx/novels/sheek-and-foxfire/stats,November 2012,"
<p><em>Caid rolled his shoulders and stretched, trying to dispel the tiredness he felt from another hour spent going over his design. They would not be effective, he knew, but instead of giving up and scrapping the whole design, he was pouring hour after hour into the project in an attempt to find and squash all the bugs and make his design perfect.</em></p>
<p><em>Trouble was, he thought as he took a sip of the still-cold coffee on his desk, he could feel he wasn’t making a difference. There was a feeling so intangible and yet so recognisable when a design was just right, and although he had sketched the articulated wings in a spurt of creativity, he was now floundering. What was landmark about his design had been lost with his high, and he felt adrift at sea as he stared at the papers.</em></p>
<p><em>His toes were asleep. The thought, so abstract, prompted him to push away from the desk in annoyance and pace irritatedly around the room. He noticed the room had fallen dark as he had stared at his computer, bathed in its colourful radiation, and now as the screen-saver flickered on, he felt oddly shut off from the world. The hallway outside his room was obscured in darkness, and he had a tingling feeling that started at the base of his spine then travelled slowly up his back to nestle at the base of his head, causing him to reflexively shiver.</em></p>
<p><em>Muttering to himself and rubbing at the back of his neck with his hand, he moved to the windows to pull shut the curtains against the evening. The street was quiet outside and would be for perhaps the couple of nights left of the holiday. The festival coinciding with a long weekend was not an oft-observed event, and many had opted to enjoy their time flamboyantly, taking full advantage of the rare delight.</em></p>
<p><em>Not for Caid. He had opted to work instead, tackling problems in the quiet left by the absence of his house-mates. However that distraction proved short-lived after an early breakthrough, and so it was that after a mere morning, Caid had fallen to doing what he always did when he was bored and alone - designing. An inventor by nature and inclination, Caid loved to draw and try to breathe life to the things he imagined in his mind. For him, the high was in grasping an idea so outlandish that it wouldn’t be feasible and wresting it to his will, bringing it down to earth and hoping each time it would work.</em></p>
<p><em>A few actually did, and had earnt him a tidy sum if not having much of an impact on the world. These only served to spur him on, reaching further into the imagined and impossible in a bid to make them real and achievable.</em></p>
<p><em>Something glinted at the corner of Caid’s vision, interrupting his thoughts. It was then that he realised what he had been staring at while he had been lost in thought. A street lamp was flickering. As he internalised that fact he wondered why it was relevant enough to interrupt his thoughts, and his eyes swept the street for anything out of the ordinary.</em></p>
<p><em>When he realised what it was, Caid gasped and gripped the edges of his windowsill rigidly in his hands, his knuckles whitening. It was a street lamp all right, just completely different from all the rest on the street! When the light flickered above it, it lit the area in a small radius revealing an old-style lamp post, rather than the modern lamp he had gazed at for the last three years.</em></p>
<p><em>As he stared at this incredible occurrence on such a mundane fixture of life, he began to notice that the flickering was not random, not was it the sort of a starter vainly struggling to light a bulb long past its prime. No, it was a signal.</em></p>

<p>It started, as these things often do, with a baby’s cry.<br/>“He’s a bit small.” Ffian commented critically.<br/>“That’s the nature of babies, dear.” Her mother, Sanoa, gently explained.<br/>“But he’s so tiny! Was I ever that tiny?” Ffian exclaimed.<br/>“Actually you were larger, and you didn’t cry so much.” It was her father, Colm, who spoke. He reached over and soothed back the black fuzz on the head of the baby nestled in his wife’s arms. “He has your mother’s hair though, whereas you take after me.” He said, ruffling Ffian’s hair.<br/>Ffian shook her head, clearing the chestnut hair from her face, and reached forward a finger tentatively towards the baby. “What’s his name going to be?”<br/>Her mother looked at her father, and he nodded. “Daveren. Little Davey.” She announced, smilingly kissing Daveren’s cheek.<br/>Ffian’s finger poked Daveren’s arm and the baby’s eyes opened. Two coal-black eyes stared up at her intensely, then a hand grabbed for the finger and, capturing it, the eyes closed again.<br/>Ffian released her breath, only then realising she’d been holding it. Her mother smiled. “It looks like he likes you.”<br/>“Give him a while, he’ll learn.” Colm muttered good-naturedly.<br/>Something must have passed between her mother and father then, because when Ffian looked up again, two pairs of eyes were on her.<br/>“Kiddo, can you take your brother outside for a minute? Your mother and I need to talk about something briefly, and we don’t want to disturb him too much.” Ffian’s father said.<br/>“It’s good to give you some time with Davey so you can bond, Fi.” Her mother added, using her pet name.<br/>Ffian narrowed her eyes, trying to look stern. “You’re not going to fight again, are you?”<br/>“Do we ever?” Colm asked, mischievously.<br/>“Yes, you do. You say things like ‘I should never have married such a green-eyed serpent!’ and mum says--”<br/>Colm interrupted. “I don’t remember saying anything like that, do you dear?” He asked his wife.<br/>“No, I can’t for the life of me think where you’d hear that from, Fi.” Sanoa smiled, her upturned lips meeting Colm’s kiss.<br/>Ffian screwed up her face and then stuck out her tongue at her amused parents. A sentiment they readily returned, before laughing helplessly.<br/>“Oh alright.” Ffian gave in. She slid her arm around the baby and settled him in her arms. He opened his eyes briefly, then yawning, closed them again. “I think I make him tired.”<br/>“You make us all tired, dear.” Her mother said laughingly and Ffian stuck her tongue out at her again as she went out the door.<br/>In the quietly busy corridor of the maternity ward outside, Ffian settled carefully into a padded plastic chair and studied the new addition to the family intently, who still had Ffian’s finger clutched in his tiny hand.<br/>Ffian tugged her finger experimentally, but it seemed to be stuck fast. She tickled Daveren’s belly with her other hand, but all he did was burp. She sighed, giving up and as she did, he let go of her finger and his eyes opened again, his hand reaching up to touch her hair.<br/>Time slowed as a golden shockwave rippled out, stirring her hair with a phantom wind. The corridor disappeared in a moment, the ward fading away to leave a coruscating gateway of gold and white incandescent light...</p>

Jen said. <br/><br/>No one answered because lumbering out from behind a snow drift came a huge elephant, followed by an oversized chicken, although as they got closer they could see that it was in fact a chicken suit. Sylvie felt nauseous. It was as if the wormhole was a crack in reality and they had fallen through into a place where nothing made any sense any more. Vernon brought the transport to a halt near the elephant and the costumed person. <br/><br/>""I'm going to try to talk to these people,"" Corvoisier said. Poppy put her hand on his shoulder. ""Do you think that's wise?""<br/><br/>""Probably not, but we need to do it anyway."" He pulled on a snow suit and stepped out onto the snow. The sun chose that moment to break through the clouds and the scene sparkled in the light. Poppy struggled into another snow suit and followed him. The others watched.<br/><br/>Corvoisier reached the chicken-suited person and said, ""Hello, do you speak English? Parlez-vous français? Habla espanol?"" <br/><br/>""I speak American, sure do,"" the man said. ""You figuring to come see our little circus? Ain't no one better this side of the pond.""<br/><br/>A circus. Right. <br/><br/>""We're looking for somewhere to get food and water, especially water,"" Corvoisier said.<br/><br/>""You don't want to be drinking that dang nasty stuff,"" the chicken-man said. ""I can git you something fancier than that. You come watch the show and we'll fix you up with something to drink later on. We need to see your money up front, though. Don't want you running out on us like some folks have tried to do. Jimbo here'll make short work of you if an you try that.""<br/><br/>A guard elephant; well there were stranger things but not much. Corvoisier got out his wallet and held out a five pound note to the chicken-man. ""Is this legal tender here?""<br/><br/>""What's that? Nah, if you don't got no money you're just gonna have to work for your drinks. We've got plenty for you to do.""<br/><br/>And so Vernon, Poppy, Sylvie, Jen and Corvoisier found themselves mucking out animal enclosures for the best part of an Earth day. <br/></p>

There was a bench in the room with some sort of covering, and a panel in the corner that I guess held a toilet of some kind The three of them were sitting on the bench and looked more depressed than worried.<br/><br/>""Susana,"" I whispered through the grille. She looked up. <br/><br/>""In the ventilation grille, above you,"" I whispered again.<br/><br/>""Talk loudly,"" Susana said to Ewan and Ella. They started to talk about being hungry and when they'd get food.<br/><br/>Under cover of their talking, I pulled up the grille. Two grey plastic clasps snapped and I froze but no one came. With the grille out the way, Susana asked me what we were doing and I explained the plan. <br/><br/>""So you get in here with us, and that helps us get out how?"" she asked. Clearly the narrator hadn't thought this one through.</p>

<p> Prologue excerpt:</p>
<p>On the grotty public phone, she dialled the number only friends and family had.  The one that was for personal use only and kept off the books.  It rang and rang.  There was no voicemail facility – that was deliberate.</p>
<p>Chewing her lip, she thought about her next move.  She’d not thought past this step.  In the back of her head was always the thought that she knew someone who could help her out if things went really, really bad.  And things were bad.  Worse than she had ever imagined.</p>
<p>She slunk back against the phone as if it offered some disguise.  Who could she call next?  There was no one else who <em>could</em> help her.</p>
<p>She tried the personal number again.  Where was he?  The newspapers had shown photos of him on yet another holiday – but that was no reason for him not to pick up.  There was another number she could use.  But that one left a trail.  It would identify where she was calling from, at what time and record exactly what she said.  Any key words would be flagged up and a copy of the audio sent electronically to one, if not all, of the intelligence agencies.  The ones the public knew about and the ones they didn’t.  And even then she might not get to talk to him.</p>
<p>Time was running out.  She knew it.  She didn’t need the large station clock in her eye line to tell her that.</p>
<p>Running was impossible, she had been fortunate to get this far and knew that was purely down to luck.  If she hadn’t gone back for her bag and heard the conversation she wasn’t meant to, she would still be there with them, idling into her fate ignorant of what awaited her.</p>
<p>She ran her hands over her face.  Her skin was cold.  She knew she looked like shit.  Knew she looked exactly like she was – someone who needed a shot of something to pep her up.</p>
<p>Her whole body was tired from the effort of staying alive.  Her eyes were weary from watching, looking, checking the face of every person she could see.  The one person she feared the most though, was the one person whose face she did not know.  No one knew.  They said you only saw his face when it was the last one you were ever going to see.</p>
<p>“He likes the personal touch,” Moody had told her in one of his more sanguine moments.   They had just shared a pipe and she had let him fuck her so he had been in a better mood than the other ninety-seven per cent of the time.  “If someone really needs killing, he does it himself.  That way he knows the job is done properly and there’s no one in the chain who can blab.  And he’s good at it.  Used to be his profession, you might say, before he branched out.”</p>
<p>“Branched out?”</p>
<p>Moody’s eyes had narrowed, his whole face darkening.  He shoved her off the bed, she went flying backwards.  Moody was a big man with powerful arms.  “Stick to what you’re good for, cunt,” he said, “fucking.  That’s all you need to know.”</p>
<p>Stood in the draughty train station, she wanted to cry.  They wanted her dead and she wasn’t even sure she knew why.  If only she hadn’t taken so many drugs over the past few months she might remember what it was they thought she had seen or knew.   Didn’t they know she was good at keeping secrets?  Her whole life was full of them.  Women like her had been keeping men’s secrets for generations.</p>
<p>There was enough cash in her pocket for a train ticket home or for enough H to see her off - if she shot it all at once.  Not both.  She could choose death in a bathroom cubicle at a public train station or she could take a risk and run.  She just wasn’t sure how brave she was feeling this morning.</p>
<p>The clock ticked.  The second hand moved.  Time was running out.</p>

<p>He saw her and stopped what he was doing, scythe held in the air, one reed fractured halfway and drooping.  How long had she been there?<br/>Her skin, clearly having spent a lifetime in the shadows, was the same shade as cream teased from a cow’s udder, her lips plump strawberries which he felt a sudden and uncontrollable urge to bite into.  The strawberries parted as she realised he had seen her and he felt a prickling, a stirring, from his loins.<br/>Sweat from his exertions and the mid-day sun ran down his face and he had no option but to wipe the back of his hand across his brow.  She watched, unmoving.<br/>Did she expect him to bow and scrape?  If so, she had the wrong man – it was not his way and no man held mastery over him.  He was his own man.<br/>The sun tickled the sweat slicking his naked chest, running through the firm knots of muscles wrought by a life of hard work.  Her eyes seemed to follow a line of sweat as it ran down his knotted abdomen and disappeared from sight under the line of his trousers.  Her eyes followed it still and conscious of her gaze he began to harden.  Despite his obvious arousal, she still did not look away.  If anything she seemed more intrigued by him.<br/>Then she looked up.  Their eyes connected. He felt a thud within him.  He wanted her, and moreover – she wanted him.<br/>He kept her waiting, it was his turn to examine her with his eyes.<br/>Her creamy skin was turning a soft rose on her cheeks, her chest and he knew there was somewhere else, out of sight that would be reddening for him.  Her breathing became shallower, already constrained because of the tight corset these women insisted on wearing.  Her breasts were small, but high and round.  He imagined his hands cupped around them.<br/>He imagined the wetness between her legs, the welcome it was preparing for him.</p>

<p>This year, I'm not going to be writing a novel during NaNoWriMo. Instead, I'm working on a series of short stories inspired and based on folk songs, particularly on the 'Child ballads', but also other songs. They'll be under 5k each, some a little longer than others, so it's going to take at least ten stories to hit wordcount, and probably more.</p>
<p>I completed the first one before November, so it doesn't count as part of NaNo, but I've listed it below anyway.</p>
<p>For the most part, I'm rewriting the stories to have little or no romance, and where it's essential to have romance, I'm giving it a twist -- usually by changing the genders of the characters either to reverse the roles or to make them LGBTQ. But I'm trying to focus on other kinds of love -- familial affection and friendship, primarily.</p>
<p>I'm posting the stories (along with covers, which is very exciting!) on Wattpad. It's my first foray into Wattpad, and I'm a little nervous about joining a new community, but if you'd like to read along, <a href=""https://www.wattpad.com/user/MiriamJoyWrites"">you can find my profile here</a>.

I'm trying to be quiet, and the woods do their best to help me: when I tread on a fallen branch, it gives way with a dull snicker instead of snapping, intensifying the smell of leaf-mould around me. By all rights the rain ought to have robbed this place of its otherworldliness, its sharp autumnal power, but it only adds to it.</p>

<p>""No rose?""</p>
<p>""I knew you'd be here without your blood on the leaves.""</p>
<p>My gaze darts to her face, her hair, her clothes. She hasn't changed. Every year I think this might be the one where she shows some sign of age, but for all the world you'd think she was fourteen and not a day more.</p>

<p>BENEATH THE BRANCHES<br/><br/>Based on the legend of the fourth century king, Niall of the Nine Hostages, this epic novel spanned the King's birth to his death. It involved my first experience of winning NaNoWriMo during the first week — specifically, on day seven. It was also incredibly terrible, with numerous instances of head hopping and just poor writing, so I never bothered to edit it. Still, I was still fairly new to the writing game at that point. At 126k, it was also the longest novel I've written to date. Well, what do you expect when it spans a guy's entire life?<br/><br/>FIGUREHEAD<br/><br/>This marginally less disastrous novel followed the story of Alanna, the Queen in a futuristic England, who was determined to regain some of the power of her ancient predecessors. Although still not a great novel, and with various cameo appearances including Mr Ian Woon, it's the kind of thing that if I'm ever stuck for inspiration, I will go back and rewrite it. Maybe.

My father did not cope well with this and knowing that unless he did something, the same miserable fate awaited his own family. It became more urgent for him to make a name for himself when he fell in love and had his love unexpectedly reciprocated for there was no way the girl's father would give them his permission, and at the time it was required for the father of the bride to conscent to the marriage, to be married. Being a farmer was out of the question. There was no land to buy, even if he had had the money. It had to be the sea then. Like most men of his time, he had done some time on the fishing boats as a young man. It was a quick way to make some money back then. There was always need for hands on board. He was fairly well acquainted with the ways of fishing boats and nets and harpoons and there was decent money in the hunt of seals. A good season on a seal or whaling ship could make a man enough money to see him through an otherwise idle year. If he worked the ships for a couple of years and the farm and animals the rest of the year, he could have enough to buy his own craft and crew it by the time they had set for the wedding. It was a respectable man that owned his own ship even though it was a hard life for him and his family but there were no other likely livelihood on the island in those days anyway. His lady love was resigned to the long wait even though it must have been hard to live the life of a fisherman's wife without the wedding first. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the next couple of years were not as good as could be expected, the hunt was poor, the prices low as the customers had little money to spend on luxuries after the devastation of the second world war and the seal and whale populations followed other routes or were hunted by ships further along their migratory path. My father could not see the end of his quest, it seemed as if the world was conspiring against him and his girl was growing impatient, all her friends were getting married and some already well on their way to having large families and she was still waiting. She had plenty of suitors too and it was becoming harder and harder to keep rejecting them.<br/>F<br/>In desperation, my father took to doing anything and everything that would get him money. He was going a bit crazy by then, what with his father's health failing and his mother unable to cope with everything by herself. There was little food and little money and the cousin himself not doing well enough to help even a little. My father took to going out at night to try to salvage what he could from the wrecks offshore, some from fishing boats that had met a sorry end in a storm or on the rocks, a couple of warships that had been sunk off the coast by the German submarines which lay also on the seafloor having gone under too. It was very little, the war didn't ally make it this far north but for the one time, but it was something. His anger was rising, he had always had a temper and too much pride for his situation. It got so that he spent less and less time with his fiancee, preferring to stay out by the sea rather than face what he thought was a mocking community that thought him a failure and worthless. He even got to blaming the poor girl who had done nothing more than agree to be his wife even though before he had determined to buy his own ship. <br/><br/>One night, as he wondered the shore aimlessly, pretending even to himself that he was looking for clams and crabs and seaweed, he lost track of time. He wandered a long way over beach and over field until he found himself to tired and too far away to make it back home. He found a place to to camp out for the night. He knew it would not rain that night, possessing that sixth sense that folk living with nature day in and day out possess that tells them what the weather will be like. He lay down, shelt from the breeze between a rocky jetty and a cliff and tried to fall asleep. His mind was too excited by his angry thoughts and his resentment and would not let him rest. As he lay there, watching the moving ocean, hoping the waves would lull him to sleep, he heard it. There was a melody in the wind that he had never heard before. It was beautiful and haunting and it filled the air. Most importantly, it was a joyful tune, full of life and happiness and care-free joy. Whoever was making that music was everything he was a not. It was irresistible so when he stood up and started following the melody, no one can say that they would have done otherwise themselves. <br/></p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>1514</strong></p>
<p>""Thomas! Mary!""</p>
<p>It was a common shout to hear through the halls of Hever Castle these days. Thomas and Mary Boleyn had never quite grown out of their troublesome streak as they’d gotten older, and now that they were both preparing to begin life at court once their father returned from London, their mother and tutors had been trying to get them to stop their childish behaviour.</p>
<p>Thomas glanced over at his twin sister, that same devilish twinkle in his eyes that had so exasperated their mother and nursemaid as young children. ""Goodness, whatever have we done now?"" he asked as he laid down another card on the table. ""George must have told Mother about how you upset the steward yesterday.""</p>
<p>""Oh, yes, because you were entirely innocent of the whole affair. I can’t imagine why he would have gotten upset,"" Mary laughed. ""We didn’t do much of anything.""</p>
<p>""Really, the equipment was much more nicely organized the way we put it,"" Thomas agreed, turning around to see if their mother had reached the parlour at last. There still seemed to be no sign of her approaching, although a shadow near the doorway was rather suspicious. ""George, you might as well come out from there,"" he called. ""I can see you.""</p>
<p>Mary stifled the giggle as their younger brother emerged, a look of resignation on his face. ""Why, hello, George. What brings you here?""</p>
<p>George scowled at her momentarily. ""You know, Mary, you really ought to be more careful about how you behave. Father said people are talking in London about how Anne went to court and you didn’t.""</p>
<p>Mary rolled her eyes in Thomas’ direction as her twin clearly tried to bite back a smart remark. ""George, Anne went to the courts of Margaret because she desperately needed to learn French. I, on the other hand, have no need of that extra learning. <em>Monsieur Rocher dit que je suis parfaitement bilingue</em>,"" she added cheekily.</p>
<p>""Thomas and Mary Boleyn!"" their mother shouted again, this time much nearer to the parlour. Glancing at each other for only the briefest of moments, the twins quickly put away their cards and pulled the letters they were meant to be writing back towards them.</p>
<p>""You’re going to be in such <em>trouble</em>..."" George singsonged faintly as he collected the cards from their hiding spot and sat down at one of the other tables to start playing. ""Mother is in such a fix today...""</p>
<p>""A sure sign that another baby Boleyn is on the way,"" Thomas muttered under his breath to Mary, who nodded tiredly. It was true, after all, that their mother had been in a fouler and fouler state since their father had last returned from court in London. The two eldest Boleyn children had long since learned to recognise the signs that Lady Boleyn was expecting another baby.</p>
<p>""My, but you <em>are</em> crude today,"" George said from his spot across the room.</p>
<p>""What do you think?"" Thomas asked Mary softly, glaring at his younger brother momentarily. ""Do you think Mother would be happy to have another child? There’s been so many stillborn, especially since Henry passed.""</p>
<p>Mary paused, thinking over her response. ""I don’t know. We eldest are nearly full grown now - Anne and I shall be wed soon enough. Perhaps Mother would prefer to leave her childbearing days behind her. Howard’s death hit her hard, and I don’t think she’s ever loved the young ones the way she loved him.""</p>
<p>Thomas shrugged his shoulders. ""I don’t know that I like the thought of you leaving Hever Castle. After all, we’ve been together all of our lives... and Father said that we’d be able to go to court together before we’re grown. You can’t get married before you go to court - that’s just madness.""</p>
<p>Mary’s response was interrupted by one final bellow from the Lady Boleyn. ""THOMAS AND MARY BOLEYN!""</p>

<p>08/11/13: Thank you to designer Bryony Gomez-Palacio for her beautiful cover during the 30 Covers in 30 Days marathon!<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>When Mary I takes the English throne in 1553, life in the small village of St. Dunstan-in-the-Hills changes drastically. Catholicism once again is the approved religion of the day - but as the faithful of St. Dunstan soon discover, just because the new Queen decrees it, it doesn't necessarily change your core belief system.<br/><br/>Caught between the laws of the land, and the laws of the Lord, the families and parish leaders of St. Dunstan try to live by both - until they realize in the most heart-sickening of ways that you can't serve both God and man.<br/><br/>I Believe follows 16-year-old Alice Cotton, as well as her best friends Jane Leynham and Thom Aynesworth. Together, they represent the three major religious controversies of their time: Anglican, Catholic and Lutheran. While they are each sincere in their own religious affiliations, the three young friends must learn to navigate the difficulties of the Marian persecution to figure out a way to find a common ground in their faith. <br/><br/>It will be a difficult path as they travel from their tiny home village in northern England to London, trying to convince their monarch to accept the existence of the Church of England.</p>

<p>The snow had fallen and cold was once again biting at the noses of the villagers. Merry flames lit the village square as the merchants struggled to keep the snow from landing on their wares. The fresh, warm breads at the baker's shop sent up enormous puffs of steam as they met with the frozen air, and flecks of blood splattered around the tables at the butcher as he and his son piled the meat onto the surface.<br/><br/>At the Aynesworth house, nothing much had changed. Thom hadn't seen hide nor hair of his father or his elder brother since the day his father had arrived with the news of Queen Mary's ascension. In fact, very little seemed to have changed at all in St. Dunstan-in-the-Hills since that day: except for the recent marriage between James Scott and Jane Leynham, a few births and several deaths, life was continuing as normal. The Church of England still met in their tiny village church for services, and everybody still seemed to prefer to ignore the continued Catholic Masses out in the old priory barn. After all, these were all people who had been living and working together for tens, even hundreds of years without incident: why should the arrival of a new queen change the way they lived?<br/><br/>""Still no luck on the marriage front, then, Thom?"" James Scott asked jovially, wrapping up the portion of meat that Thom had pointed out. ""Better get a move on - there aren't all that many Church of England girls left in Dunstan Hills. It would be a pity to have to choose from the Catholics.""<br/><br/>Thom laughed slightly, his little brother still clinging to his trouser leg. ""Bit difficult to find somebody crazy enough to marry an Aynesworth boy,"" he said dryly. ""Ellen might've been the last of them."" He took the package and handed it to the little boy, who carefully placed it into the basket he was carrying. ""Might even have to widen the search to Freeman's Mount.""<br/><br/>Jane appeared at her new husband's side, smiling at her old friend. ""Thom, I don't think there's a soul in the entire county who hasn't heard of your father's reputation."" She rubbed her hands together, glancing down at little James. ""So, James, have you grown big enough to help out now, then?""<br/><br/>James nodded eagerly. ""Thom lets me do all sorts of things now,"" he reported. ""And I'm strong, he says. Look at what I can carry in a basket!"" He brandished the purchases proudly, showing Jane the load.<br/><br/>""Wow,"" Jane agreed with wide eyes. ""That's amazing, James."" She kissed his forehead lightly. ""Off you run now. Go show Alice what you've got - she's just come into the square."" She pointed the little boy off in the right direction, then returned her attention to her husband and friend. ""Thom, I know James is pushing presumption a little bit, but it's true... Little James needs a lady's touch before he gets too old. I know you're doing your best... but there's only so much that a man is capable of doing. If your father isn't going to take matters in hand, or if Will isn't going to do it, then you need to.""<br/><br/>Thom sighed again. ""Jane, please don't. Not you, too.""<br/><br/>How was he supposed to explain the true difficulties in bringing anybody into this little, broken home? Nobody else in the village knew about that awful revelation that Elizabeth Aynesworth had given in her final moments: his father was running away to avoid dealing with Thom and James, and with the truth of the matter. Will was going to go to his grave denying that it was true, when they all knew in the deepest parts of their hearts that it had to be true - and that, in one way or another, each other had suspected the truth for years.<br/><br/>""I'm just trying to help you, Thom. A child needs a mother. A house needs a woman.""<br/><br/>""Good day, James. Good day, Jane,"" Thom said sharply, turning around and marching resolutely back towards the wool merchant, where Alice was laughing and praising James for his fierce strength.<br/><br/>Maybe in another life, one where your church didn't matter, he and Alice could've been perfect for each other. He could've taken her away from the dark and hopeless life trying to manage her mother's ailment, and she would've taken the truth about his life in stride. They could've created a whole new life, and a whole new family, together - away from the expectations and lies of their forefathers.</p>

<p>""So, Ethan, how was the day at school?"" Becca asked, leaning over the table to cut up April's ham into smaller pieces.

""It was like he just <em>blinked</em> right out of the world.""</p><p>""Any way, what did Mrs Spelling think of your journal entry?"" Becca asked, changing the subject slightly. ""What was the topic?""</p><p>""We were supposed to write about something that was missing,"" Ethan replied. ""She said it was a really good story. That's why she read it out loud.""</p><p>""Well, I guess that would've been a very original entry, then. What did Birch write about?"" Becca picked up her fork, eagerly anticipating her first bite of dinner... Oh, the life of a mother with young children. The days of hot dinners were a long time passed.</p><p>""Birch wrote about his dad's headdress. It's been missing for years. He thinks somebody stole it at a powwow when he was a little boy. He wrote it like we write our detective entries, with all the clues and the interviews and everything. Mrs Spelling said it was pretty good too - ""</p><p>April interrupted just then with a yelp as her cup of juice crashed down onto the floor, spreading a sticky, orangey mess across the wooden planks. ""Mommy, I'm sorry!"" she cried.</p><p>Becca sighed regretfully, putting down her knife and fork before a single bite had even reached her mouth. ""It's okay, April. It was an accident,"" she said in resignation. ""It's just juice, sweetheart."" She stopped, looking at her daughter as she burst into tears. ""It's nothing to cry over, April, sweetheart,"" she said with a short laugh. ""Don't get so upset! Mommy's not mad at you.""</p><p>""I didn't mean it, Mommy, I promise I won't do it again,"" April pleaded tearily.</p><p>""Oh, April, what are you getting so anxious about?"" Becca asked worriedly. ""Honey, everybody has accidents.""</p><p>""I don't want to get hit again,"" April whispered.</p><p>""That's what happened when Daddy hit her,"" Ethan said quietly. ""She knocked her juice onto the floor and he got mad and hit her.""</p><p>Becca stopped laughing immediately. ""April, sweetheart, I want you to understand something. What Daddy did was very wrong. Grownups should never be hitting kids, and especially not for an accident. I am not going to hurt you when you make a mistake. Everybody makes them.""</p><p>April sniffled as she looked up at Becca. ""You promise, Mommy?""</p><p>""I promise with all my heart, little girl,"" Becca said. ""Now, you keep eating, and Mommy will get all of that mess cleaned up. Just be careful where your elbows are from now on, all right?""</p>

<p>    Private schools always seem to look as though they’re hiding something sinister within their walls: especially if it’s a private school in a big, old stone building with stained glass windows, an old chapel (which nobody uses anymore because it’s politically incorrect, but it’s a piece of academic history, so nobody will tear it down), and hundreds of winding staircases in such odd places that you can’t help but wonder just what Georgian-era drug the buiders were smoking.<br/>    Tennant Academy was one such private school, hidden deep within woods, guarded by stone walls and iron fences miles away from the school itself. In the 200 years since the school first opened its doors, not muh has changed: oh, yes, they got electricity and plumbing and all that sort of thing, and they have updated curriculum, and it certainly isn’t the same staff. This isn’t a story of supernatural creatures and fantastic scenarios - there are other books for that. This is simply a story about the things that human beings do to each other, and the aftermath of an unspeakable evil.<br/>    So yes, sometimes private schools really do hide sinister things behind their magnificent stained-glass windows.

<p>I could have spent my life in Saint Petersburg, except for the buzzing black flies. A beautiful city pointlessly built on the most unappetising land in existence. Russian women should be idolised as Venus's long lost daughters, but they have such infinite sadness behind their eyes. My Russian is worse than my German, which is to say practically non-existent, but the vodka poured like water anyway and rubles slipped through my fingers like so many pieces of copper. If you have money (you, my old Lord) or pretend as you do (me, your lowly city physician), they love you forever, but you'll be put in a pauper's grave if you stay for too long. Russia, however, will never be Europe. The revolution has torn it to pieces. Being rich is a dirty word for the comrades. I was everyone's brother whilst I was there.<br/><br/>Russia, then, being Russia. Hollowed out by war. All of Europe is still shuddering to some sort of shaking off of the troubles of half a decade ago. The Russians, I fear, will never shake it off; they'll swallow it like all their sadnesses and drink their tears with their vodka. I felt the same in Austria, except their rebuilding and their pride seems a direct contrast of a country who shall carry all the blame. Wonderful country, all the same.<br/><br/>Forgive me for my dreary progress, and let me tell you of Berlin and why it is a better city than London. Lucky I'm in Paris, where your fists can't find me. We are all shadowed by memories of the Great War, but Berlin has somehow remembered where it's rouge has got to and remembered to put it on. The Art, capital A, has returned. The Music, capital M, could possibly be less Prussian but sometimes you'll find a good jazz bar along der Hauptstraße and you don't fear for the Putsch so much. Berliners have somehow regained the ability to smile, something I don't think Londoners ever had in the first place and will never have again, I'm sure. And I know I rhapsodised about the beauty of the Russians not two paragraphs ago, but beauty there is something that is stubbornly a feminine trait, whereas here in Berlin Beauty is more indiscriminate where she lays her head. I was never one to sketch but I've added a few studies of a jazz singer and her pianist that you might enjoy. I paid special attention the the pianist, with his strong Prussian jaw and the long stare. I'm sure the long stare will be lacking in my sketches, but you can imagine. </p>

<p>The sun was out and brilliantly hot, but there was enough tree shade that Spencer was actually cool. He lay back on the grass, and squinted up at the sky. He wanted to think about what had happened, but most of what he was thinking about was how to tell his parents, what the press would say, how Patrick was holding up. He thought about everything except Pete's cold, dead looking body. Inexplicably, Spencer remembered the first few lines of Emily Dickinson's ""I heard a Fly buzz, when I died"". He spent a few moments trying to remember the rest of the poem, but he was interrupted by Ashlee coming out to the backyard, standing over him. Bronx Mowgli, who looked more like Pete than anything else, stared down at him with wide eyes, his fist in his mouth. Spencer closed his eyes and took another deep breath.<br/></p>

<p>Chapter One – Toast Chase<br/><br/>It’s not particularly nice when you find yourself standing on the half derelict top floor of a shopping mall as you discover the dubbing of your jacket has lost most of its ability to dub and the external dampness created by the summer drizzle is soaking through your clothes on a collision course with the self-generated tsunami of perspiration travelling in the other direction.<br/>	I have just received a phone call, the most delightful call I have ever received; maybe the nicest and humbling phone call I will ever receive in my life.<br/>	‘That was her,’ I say to Mustard. ‘His mother,’ my eyes still staring at the now silent phone, cradled like a dead bird in the palm of my hand. ‘She thanked us. She thanked all of us for, you know, for shooting him.’<br/>	Mustard stares across my shoulder, eyes moistening. Later he’d probably say something ridiculously profound, something to help the situation, something to assist our grief, but for now he simply points and replies,<br/>	‘There used to be a Kentucky Fried Chicken shop over there.’ but that is good enough for me. He understands; the final gesture has been made and we can start the next chapter.</p>

Alas, her knowing eyes settled on the deathly-still amber-and-red leaves clinging to the trees lining the suburban street. Not a whisper of wind to muffle any sound she might make. Not a drop of rain to disguise her image from curious eyes. She let out a long sigh and turned back inside to face the small cot and it’s even smaller inhabitant. </p><p>All this time planning, and she had never imagined leaving so soon, though of course leaving some time was inevitable. If she was honest, she never imagined succeeding in the first place. She had become too comfortable, too content with failure. She glanced around at the paintings she’d collected at local art fairs, the rocking chair and pillow she’d picked out in her early excitement, the curtains she’d sewn when they first moved in, the wooden cot they’d built together. She sighed again, struggling against the urge to pick up her long desired child and just stay and be a mother. A tear slipped down her face, trailing across her cheek to land with a heavy impact on the cot’s mattress. How many had died in the struggle to create you, she wondered. How many would die to find you? To understand you? To control you? To dissect you? Her hand settled lightly on her daughter’s tuft of red hair, dropped to cup her cheek. The child shifted slightly into the warmth of her long pale palm. </p><p>One week old.</p><p>One week dead. Sheila needed to leave now, or their story would unravel. It was time. She pulled out a small velvet bag, upturned it, careful not to touch the contents as she emptied it beside the sleeping babe. She gathered her courage and withdrew her hands. And watched with fascination as her daughter turned in her sleep, one chubby hand arching over to grasp the object. With a shimmer of blue light, it transformed at her touch, leaving a silver chain and iridescent blue pendant curled into the tiny fist. That would do, she thought as she bent to kiss her daughter for the last time. She left the nursery as silently as she could. </p><p>Brad was waiting in the hallway. “Are you certain?” his eyes seemed to ask. But of course he was not one to beg.

Donc soit un animal très puissant, soit quelque chose de dérisoire. C’était son dernier recours pour prouver à tout le monde qu’elle n’était pas inutile. De la fumée commença à s’écouler de la jarre et elle fut tenté de faire un pas en arrière.<br/>« Ne bouge surtout pas ! Ou il sera libéré de ton emprise et nous n’aurons aucun contrôle sur lui. »<br/>La bouche sèche, elle se stoppa. Ce n’était pas le moment de provoquer une catastrophe ... La fumée continuait de se répandre. Une odeur de souffre s’éleva. Bientôt, la lumière baissa jusqu’à une semi-obscurité. Elle semblait entendre un orage arriver, avec des éclairs et du tonnerre retentissant comme des roulements au loin. Puis, dans un flash de lumière, tout se fini. Il n’y eu plus un bruit bizarre dehors, seulement le brouhaha constant qui régnait sur le village. Plus de fumée ou d’odeur.<br/>« Va voir ce qui se trouve dans la jarre. »<br/>Gwanaëlle prit une grande inspiration et avança à petit pas. Cela avait été assez spectaculaire ... Qu’est ce qui pouvait se trouver au fond de cette jarre ? Elle croisait les doigts. Surement quelque chose d’exceptionnel. Elle était sure d’avoir du pouvoir, il était juste bien caché au fond. Peut-être que cette invocation allait le libérer ... Elle se pencha par-dessus et vit ... Un chat. Plutôt, un chaton. Roux, comme elle, avec de grands yeux dorés. Il était très mignon, mais absolument pas méchant au premier abord. Elle tendit la main, se disant que c’était peut-être une apparence d’illusion, mais la bestiole vint se blottir contre sa main en ronronnant. Tout s’écroula. Elle était absolument déçue. Un chat. Mais c’était absolument nul comme familier ! Elle allait être la risée de tout le monde. </p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ulysses dies at dawn.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At least, that's the word on the street among those who saw what went down at Calypso's, in the bowels of the City.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The City, where this labyrinthine, twisted tale is to be told. The City that once was called a planet, until even that was forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For once upon a time, there was a city—a grim, old city, the sort of place the rain beats down like nails drawn into a coffin, where the air wafts with the cigarette stench of betrayal. At first, it stood only one among others. But year after year after year, this city, this grim, old city, started to grow like canker. And when it met other towns, other cities, it absorbed them, took  them into itself, unable to stop, devourer of its own world, until no land was left. So the city grew into the sea, sending tendrils of concrete and metal into the salty waters, master and conqueror of all life that dared dwell there, turning blues into greys. And when no sea was left, it sent its towers upwards into the infinite sky. And when no sky was left, the city burrowed inwards, into the bowels of the planet, going down deeper and deeper.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Soon enough, there was nothing but the City.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now, generations live and generations die in the warrens and the tunnels and the lower levels of the surface, never to see the sun. Never to see the stars. Never to taste a sea that doesn't exist anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is in one of the deepest, most secret of these tunnels that our hero, going by the name of Ulysses, lies currently beaten, bloody, battered, unbowed, spitting out a mouthful of teeth and disdain, under the sharp, cold gazes of four of the meanest bastards of the meanest streets of the meanest parts of the city. All immaculately turned out in pinstripes.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">She stood in a white-panelled antechamber leading to an infinity of doors and corridors, a twisted reflection of a brain cell out of which electric impulses would soon fire off along metal nerves superimposed over living ones.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; color: #000000;""> She:</span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> the avatar Ewan planned on using for that task. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; color: #000000;"">She</span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">: the one a lot of non-Keepers liked to call “the bitch”, because, let’s be honest, he had not always been playing nice when using her. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; color: #000000;"">She:</span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> the purple-haired girl all clad in blue, eye-shaped symbols painted on her clothes and tattooed on her arms, an ever-watching hunter on the prowl. A little over two years ago, when the Technomancer had fashioned her out of a desire to start anew, one of his contacts in Osaka had nicknamed her </span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; color: #000000;"">Kodama</span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">, which meant “echo” in his tongue. Because she would echo back every taunt, every move, every attack. Because she did not take anything for granted, nor did she take any bullshit from anyone.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> Because she was born from Adrian’s betrayal, and would always, always watch behind her as well as around. Hence the large white eye printed at the back of her tunic, between her shoulder-blades. Eyes. Eyes everywhere, and goggles she could pull down to read more data, and a steam-gun—no real steam involved, just Ewan musing with steampunk-inspired aesthetics—in hand, just in case of. Just in case another traitor would arise in the Weird Wild Web to cross her path.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> He did not think of himself as a real girl, of course, nor did he try to act like one when assuming this guise, and perhaps that was the very reason why people usually believed “Kodama” was a woman, and a newcomer (not so new anymore, now) in the collective known as “Echoes”. Kodama. Grendel. Cluster1. A handful of others. All facets of the same psyche, the same persona. All reflecting something different. Even the blue demon with wires in place of hair and gleaming, threatening horns was born at some point out of the young man’s inner turmoil, the nascent artificial intelligence within his ternary computer picking on the mental feedback he sent through it, day after day.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> Feedback both enhanced and tainted by Adrian. Friendship and treachery. Love and hatred. Control and anger.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> ‘Whew,’ Grendel whistled, welcoming her—</span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; color: #000000;"">him</span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">—into the luminous cube, blue, black and white dreadlocks whirling around his head. ‘Took you only ages to get your ass in there.’</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> ‘Shut up. I needed to prepare my stuff before.’</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> ‘Yeah, yeah, whatever. So what’s that connection for?’</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> ‘Who. Not what.’</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> The demon studied him with narrowed eyes, the third, vertical one on his forehead blinking once, all blood and amber. Raising his left arm, that wired, cybernetic monstrosity of a limb, twice as big as the other, he casually left a long, black claw trail against the nearest wall, filling the digital air with a grating sound. Echoes did not flinch, staring back, one fisted hand on his hip, the other resting on the butt of the steam-gun strapped at the waist of his avatar. Computing, making lists. Weapons. Ammunition. Software. Right side: drawers number twelve and eighteen. Left sight: drawers number eleven , twenty-three and thirty-five. His gun was only his first line of action, his most obvious means of attack—in other words, here for show and not much more. The really serious gear had to be packed in specific ways.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> ‘Feh. You’re no fun.’ Grendel shrugged, tapping the wall with his finger, causing a large bench to shoot out. The demon jumped on it, sitting cross-legged, as his creator (progenitor, owner, twisted reflection, Echoes had never cared about properly finding out) paced in front of the drawers.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> ‘You want fun?’ the Technomancer asked, his back on the artificial intelligence. ‘I’m gonna give you some. Just wait and see.’</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> ‘A </span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; color: #000000;"">who</span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">, right? So it’s </span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; color: #000000;"">forbidden stuff. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Playing like a big boy at last. Didn’t think ya’d had it in ya.’ Gren’s voice dripped with mockery, but also with something akin to admiration, at least for a creature like him. He would never grace the mage with an actual compliment.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> Echoes smiled and snapped his fingers to open the twenty-third drawer. The demon arched an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> ‘Oooh, yeah, baby, tell me you’re taking </span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; color: #000000;"">these.</span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">’</span></p>

<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> Grendel flashed a sharky grin, full of pointy metallic teeth, while Echoes tapped a few button-shaped keys on the bracelet around his avatar’s naked left arm. A tiny ball of light appeared in front of him, expanding into a holographic interface, bright-blue circles upon circles, brimming with information and input windows. His gloved fingers started flying over the virtual screens, inputting one command after the other at the speed of thought. The antechamber may feel like a normal, if cold and empty room, yet whatever happened in there only took a few nanoseconds in the outside, physical world.</span></p>

The good thing with being a white hat? Sometimes, you could afford to dabble into black areas for the sake of maintaining a grey balance. Oh, he would get caught. Someday. Just not today, since he was not connecting to the organisation’s servers, and had long ago learnt how to disable the tracking function on his computer, all the while slapping a masking algorithm that allowed his peers in Vienna to log what </span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; color: #000000;"">he</span><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> wanted.

<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> ‘Aaaaand on with the shopping list,’ Echoes said in the sing-song, feminine voice of his avatar. The other good thing: like most Technomancers, and especially as a Warder, he was entitled to keep copies of defence programs. Obviously, having to download them from a server every time he needed them was a waste of precious time, and thus a liability.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""> He had simply failed to report the attack programs he had also downloaded, and never handed back.</span></p>

<p>((I originally wrote this story in French during NaNoWriMo 2010, but never got around to actually finishing it—bad, I know. So, this year, I want to write that missing last third.))<br/><br/>1842. As the world around Europe is disappearing both from earth and from people's memories, a new threat is rising: the Devourers, plant-like creatures poisoning the ground with their seeds, infecting soil, trees, animals and people. Faceless enemy, possessed with the souls of the corrupted dead, their dark roots grow into nests. Nobody knows where they came from, nor when the first of them was born; the only sure thing is that they must be destroyed. Fortunately, a handful of men and women might still have a chance at making a difference.<br/><br/>Born with the ability to bend reality to their will, they sell dreams to those who can't find inner peace anymore; they raise the dead or attach them to their beloved ones to help them fight the pull of oblivion; they use their blood to power their weapons. They are doctors, rulers, soldiers, merchants, commanders, hunters, peasants. They come from all stratae of society, from the upper classes to the humblest working families. The rich ones are offered promises of a brilliant career as officiers and government agents; the poor ones are sold to the Crown by their own families in exchange for money. In any case, refusing to serve is not an option; however, the reward of a longer life, of preserved strength and slowed down aging, tends to fend off their reluctance. They are the Chosen Ones, the Enlightened Ones, those who in times of old were called witches and warlocks, mages and sorcerers, but who are now a shining hope for their less potent peers.<br/><br/>In a last-chance attempt to circumvene the Devourers, King Charles V Stuart of Britannia orders the building of an experimental war airship, to be steered by one of the most feared families of mages: the steel-blue eyed Claricks.<br/><br/>On board the Edinburgh, the fate of thousands of people will be thus decided. Captain Aidan Clarick tries to delay the much-dreaded order to fire off the mass destruction weapon only the cursed blood of his kin can activate. Second-in-command Wilhelmina Wallenstein, his sweet but strong-willed wife, decides to stand up for what she believes is right. And Wolfram McAlexander, the Reanimator, poises between his urge to help immediately and his plans for a long-term solution, one that he believes would at last free the people of this world.<br/><br/>But time is running short; hope is running thin; and soon the looming tragedy cannot be avoided anymore...</p>

<p>“So what? What are you suggesting?”<br/> <br/>He remained silent at first, his gaze again unfocused, as was the case when he was communicating with the Mind. She didn’t like this either. Most often, he was talented at keeping in control, but there had been a few occurrences when he had lost it, gone on a rampage, carried away by the thousands of murdering thoughts of the ghosts that were supposed to serve him, and not the other way round. She could never really tell whether he was in full control or about to snap, and this was one of the reasons behind her constant fear of her brother.<br/><br/>	“Slicer!”<br/><br/>	He blinked a few times, then focused his intense gaze on her again.<br/><br/>	“What do we do now? There’s no way I’m letting those… <i>roaches</i> ruin our work!”<br/>	“Indeed. And that’s why you’re going to stop them.”<br/>	“I’m—You mean you won’t help? That’s not what—”<br/>	“There’s something else I must do,” he cut her, and his tone turned to steel, crushing, denying her any right to speak up. “Have you forgotten? We’ve got two other targets.”<br/><br/>	Dana clenched her fists, with such strength and violence that two of her fingernails broke under the strain, embedded within the flesh of her palms. That, too, she knew: he was going to deprive her of her revenge, of what should have been her mission, of what would have remained her task, hadn’t she failed the previous day. <i>The girl. The girl and the heartless man. I want them. I want them, and he knows that, and he’s openly defying me!</i><br/><br/>	“You’re doing that on purpose,” she growled, her voice no more than a low growl.<br/>	“I’m doing that because you failed, dear sister,” he smiled again—such a pleasant smile he had, the bastard! “But don’t worry. I’m not killing them. Not yet. There’s another way to get what we want, and it’ll be more efficient.”<br/> <i>In other words, I’ll never get a chance to kill them myself if</i> his <i>plan works!</i><br/><br/>	She was trapped. If she if she didn’t go along with his methods, Mother would punish her. If she obeyed him, she’d remain powerless, forced to cope with the sight of those two humans who twice had caused her to fail. She knew all too well, that Mother intended to Turn them too, to make a new brother out of the man, that man who was already one step closer to them than anyone else had ever been. Dana could cope with one Slicer; not with two.<br/><br/>	It was unbearable.<br/><br/>	“Don’t, sister,” his voice whispered directly to her ear all of a sudden. His hands were on her wrists again, pinning her arms along her body, squeezing with such strength that had he wanted so, he could have broken her thin bones. She gasped, both surprised and frightened, and the stale, dry air of the Deadlands that entered her mouth and lungs brought with it promises of pain and suffering.<br/><br/>	“Don’t,” Slicer repeated. “This time, it’s <i>my</i> turn to strike.

Let’s meet again at the Shards, in one hour’s time, shall we?”<br/><br/>	Dana nodded, her throat constricted by a nauseating anguish.<br/>	She had never known what his mortal name had been, but the one he used now, <i>Slicer</i>, sure suited him all too well, because he had just once again sliced into her resolve as if it was the easiest thing in the world.</p>

<p>1842. As the world around Europe is disappearing both from earth and from people's memories, a new threat is rising: the Devourers, plant-like creatures poisoning the ground with their seeds, infecting soil, trees, animals and people. Faceless enemy, possessed with the souls of the corrupted dead, their dark roots grow into nests. Nobody knows where they came from, nor when the first of them was born; the only sure thing is that they must be destroyed. Fortunately, a handful of men and women might still have a chance at making a difference.<br/><br/>Born with the ability to bend reality to their will, they sell dreams to those who can't find inner peace anymore; they raise the dead or attach them to their beloved ones to help them fight the pull of oblivion; they use their blood to power their weapons. They are doctors, rulers, soldiers, merchants, commanders, hunters, peasants. They come from all stratae of society, from the upper classes to the humblest working families. The rich ones are offered promises of a brilliant career as officiers and government agents; the poor ones are sold to the Crown by their own families in exchange for money. In any case, refusing to serve is not an option; however, the reward of a longer life, of preserved strength and slowed down aging, tends to fend off their reluctance. They are the Chosen Ones, the Enlightened Ones, those who in times of old were called witches and warlocks, mages and sorcerers, but who are now a shining hope for their less potent peers.<br/><br/>In a last-chance attempt to circumvene the Devourers, King Charles V Stuart of Britannia orders the building of an experimental war airship, to be steered by one of the most feared families of mages: the steel-blue eyed Claricks.<br/><br/>On board the Edinburgh, the fate of thousands of people will be thus decided. Captain Aidan Clarick tries to delay the much-dreaded order to fire off the mass destruction weapon only the cursed blood of his kin can activate. Second-in-command Wilhelmina Wallenstein, his sweet but strong-willed wife, decides to stand up for what she believes is right. And Wolfram McAlexander, the Reanimator, poises between his urge to help immediately and his plans for a long-term solution, one that he believes would at last free the people of this world.<br/><br/>But time is running short; hope is running thin; and soon the looming tragedy cannot be avoided anymore...<br/><br/>((2/3 completed))</p>

<p><i>The Inverness Courier - Saturday, January 21, 1842</i><br/><br/><b>Loch Moy: Etait-ce vraiment justifié?</b><br/><br/>Dans notre édition de ce matin, nous avions donné à entendre à nos lecteurs que la région entourant le Loch Moy avait grandement souffert d’une attaque de Dévorantes. Nous sommes dès ce soir en mesure de confirmer que ladite infestation a bien, non seulement été jugulée, mais de plus anéantie dans sa totalité par les forces de la Royal Air Force &amp; Navy embarquées à bord du HMS <i>Edimbourg</i>, actuellement sous le commandement du Duc et de la Duchesse de Thornhill et Moray. A la suite de précédentes infestations, il y a de cela un peu plus d’un an, un grand nombre des habitants de cette zone déjà peu cultivée des Hautes Terres avait renoncé à retourner dans leurs villages, préférant émigrer vers Inverness ou encore Nairn. Coïncidence ? Coup du sort ? A cette époque déjà, ceux qui avaient nettoyé ces terres meurtries étaient justement Aidan et Wilhelmina Clarick.<br/><br/>Néanmoins, dans un souci d’honnêteté, et en vertu du devoir d’information qui est le nôtre à l'<i>Inverness Courier</i>, nous nous devons de tempérer toute velléité de crier victoire. Car le nettoyage ayant été effectué l’hiver dernier et celui dont le Loch Moy a été le théâtre au cours de la nuit précédente ne peuvent être comparés. En effet, l’armement d’un nouveau type dont dispose le HMS <i>Edimbourg</i>, s’il est bel et bien capable de juguler toute menace dévorante de façon radicale, s’est avéré l’être peut-être bien trop. Il a été donné à voir à nos journalistes à bord du vaisseau de ligne <i>Star of Highland</i> que le résultat de la frappe effectuée par le vaisseau militaire a été des plus catégoriques, ne laissant désormais qu’un gigantesque cratère en lieu et place du Loch Moy et de ses environs immédiats. Est-il donc possible d’affirmer qu’au vu de la faible densité de population de cette région, seules les Dévorantes ont été touchées ? Rien n’est moins sûr.<br/><br/>Lady Julia Davenport, honorée citoyenne d’Inverness, a d’ores et déjà réuni la Société des Amis du Peuple afin de s’insurger contre l’emploi de telles armes. A tort ou à raison ? Nous ne saurions décider pour vous. Nous vous invitons donc à transmettre vos avis sur cette question à notre journal, par câble ou par courrier, avis qui feront prochainement l’objet d’un article consacré à cette question d’éthique nouvelle et fort particulière.</p>

<p>The woman laughed, a laugh as cold and cruel as her smile, and his thoughts vanished, replaced by another certainty, another instinct: <i>I must kill her.</i> Right now, he had to raise his fist and smash her out of consciousness, or grab her by the throat and choke her to death. But his limbs did not move; his willpower was not enough to force his body to obey. If only she could stop laughing…<br/><br/><i>’I see you don't believe me. Well. Look at yourself, then.’<br/><br/>Truth.</i><br/><br/>A deep noise started to cover her laughter, a rumble that echoed all around them in the hollow cave the Tottenham Court Road station had become. Taking his eyes off her now would be a mistake; however, he felt that if he did not check whether what she said was true or not, he would regret it.<br/><br/><i>‘You're Heartless, yet also clueless and powerless, it seems. You poor little Nothing.’<br/><br/>...Heartless?</i><br/><br/>The noise reached a deafening level.

Some of the silhouettes around them had already started moving, to engulf themselves in its iron mouth.<br/><br/><i>‘You want to know more, don't you? I’m so sorry, I have to go away for now. But feel free to follow me in. Catch me if you can.

<p>La Frateria était en émoi ce soir, du plus jeune tire-laine de Calan au cambrioleur expérimenté, du plus bas des receleurs aux élégantes fausses courtisanes chargées de séduire les hautes gens pour leur dérober leurs biens. Sur toutes les lèvres flottait une rumeur bien étrange, celle d’une Ombre venue rendre visite au Chef, et l’on racontait qu’Agas la Main Noire s’était enfermé dans ce qu’il appelait son cabinet de travail, en compagnie de l’homme dont personne encore n’avait pu entrevoir le visage.</p><p>Personne, sauf Ari Sang-d’Ombre, présentement assise sur l’une des tables de la salle basse de l’auberge du Chat Boiteux, l’un des repaires de la Frateria ; elle contemplait l’une des fines dagues de lancer dont elle ne se séparait jamais, et tâchait de répondre de son mieux aux incessantes questions que lui posaient ses collègues. Qui disait Noiraud disait nécessairement leurs bâtards aussi, et du moment où la nouvelle s’était faite jour, elle n’avait pas eu à attendre deux minutes avant de voir se précipiter vers elle les premiers curieux.</p><p>Non, elle ne savait pas pourquoi cet homme était en ville, ni quelles affaires il pouvait bien avoir à régler avec Agas, et encore moins si la Guilde dans son ensemble serait impliquée. Son identité ? Il ne lui avait donné qu’un prénom, qui peut-être même était faux. Son âge ? Qui pouvait seulement connaître l’âge exact d’un Kellenin, eux que l’on disait aussi anciens que Valdran lui-même ? La jeune femme sentait peu à peu un agacement certain la gagner, et les moqueries que lâchait à demi-mot la rousse Shanin, assise sur les genoux de l’arnaqueur Valeo à deux tables de là, ne faisaient rien pour arranger son humeur.</p><p>« Puisque tu sembles tout mieux savoir que les autres, vas-y, raconte-leur donc toute l’histoire, déclara enfin la jeune femme, fatiguée de répéter son aventure de la veille, avec un regard noir dardé dans la direction de la courtisane.</p><p>— Inutile de se fâcher pour si peu, voyons, rétorqua Shanin, inclinant la tête avec grâce, et non loin d’elle, Catrala lui fit écho d’un sourire au pli venimeux. Je ne fais que dire tout haut ce que d’autres pensent tout bas. Pourquoi donc un Kellenin se serait-il donné la peine de te tirer, toi, des pattes des soldats ? Et ceux du gars Averen, en plus !</p><p>— Tu n’as qu’à lui demander toi-même. (Ari haussa une épaule, ses doigts fuselés se crispant sur le manche de l’un de ses couteaux.) C’est vous qui voulez tout savoir. Soit vous prenez ce que je vous donne, soit vous allez vous faire pendre.</p><p>— Tsk, tsk. Que de hargne, ma chère, que de hargne. »</p><p>Les yeux plissés de manière imperceptible, Ari effectua un petit geste sec de la main. Dans un sifflement, la dague partit pour venir se ficher dans le mur, à tout juste cinq centimètres de la joue de Shanin, où elle continua de vibrer durant plusieurs secondes. Qu’elle cueillît entre les deux yeux le portrait du Rat esquissé à la hâte sur du mauvais parchemin, et que quelque soldat mal renseigné avait affiché là l’an passé, même pas conscient de l’ironie de la chose à bien des égards, n’était pas un hasard. Durant un court instant, les conversations s’éteignirent, et la jeune sang-mêlé prit cela comme une opportunité pour placer un sourire faussement innocent.</p><p>« Désolée.

<p>The Archmage looked at the jubilant crowd thronging the streets of Providence, and knew almost without a doubt that this time, no family nor friends of his would come to greet him atop the Castle's high stairs.</p><p>It was to be expected, he tried to persuade himself, mulling the thought over and over in his head as the regal procession was making its way, slowly, from the Door of the Sun to the center of the city, from the large avenue over Serenity Bridge. It was to be expected. In spite of the victories, the likes of him were still distrusted by many of the kingdom's inhabitants, and long ago already, he had made a point in isolating himself from the ones he had known. There always was so much work, so many battle plans to make, so much tension in the Throne Room, where King Aubrey kept defiying, year after year, the councillors who disagreed with his politics. How could a meager friendship resist to such pressure, to such a need to maintain the silent truce?</p><p>Later on, with experience, had come the realization that loneliness was the only possible way for a mage. Later on, yet much to his dismay, already too late.</p><p>The Archmage backed a sigh, letting his gaze wander over the countless heads, blonde and auburn and brown and white, over the admirative and awed gazes of those who would never understand the responsibilities of a ruler as well as of his close servants. Men and women, young and old, burgesses and laborers, all of them had set their differences apart on that very day to cheer for the King. For the King, and his army of Knights and Mages under one banner gathered, sworn to victory at all costs. Another sigh. With each passing day, keeping the proud, feral smile on his lips felt more and more like a masquerade. Many faces and bodies poured in the streets; many were also missing, who had clapped their hands in enthusiasm only a few seasons ago.</p><p>""Do not look so worried, old friend. Now is a time for showing them our strength, and nothing else.""</p><p>The voice took him unaware, and he turned his head in a reflex. In front of him, as calm as ever in his shiny armor, King Aubrey rode with his head held high, waving at the crowd here and there, flashing smiles to random people who would one day tell their children that they had met the mighty sovereign himself. The man was always so full of surprises; he hadn't even needed more than one quick side glance to his faithful personal mage to know what plagued his mind.</p><p>Resisting the urge to bow his head, the Archmage smiled again. Another mask, and another, and another - thousands of fake smiles, thousands of fake greetings. His powers would be nothing if he ever dared to displease the King, the one whom he owed all his fortune, the house on the sunny hill of Trinity, the place of power at the Court, and the hand of the charming Lady Phyllis.</p><p>At the thought of his wife awating his return at home, he felt his heart sink, and forcing a new wide smile was all he could do to prevent the mask from shattering.</p>

I've basically been brought up as a future doctor."" <br/>""So you know how things work."" <br/>""I guess you can say that. Can I tell you something? I've been wanting my whole life to tell someone about my artistic side. I'm just so, I don't have time really to tell people about my hobbies. All people expect out of me is medical information."" <br/>""I believe everyone has an artistic side, and I also believe people should express what they love to do. Wait did you say you loved art, or you're just good at it?"" <br/>""Art is one of the most beautiful things in the world. It can tell a story in so many ways."" Allie and Carter bonded over the works of art they both enjoyed. It turns out they have a lot more in common than they believe. For the first time, Carter could express what he loves, without feeling obligated to bring science into it. Allie on the other hand felt like she could also be herself, and not feel talked down on by her friends. After all, Gwen and Alex were her best friends, but they were a lot more studious than Allie. When Allie and Carter were alone, they could be who they were meant to be. Since Allie knew nothing about Carter before, he could retell his story like he wanted to. <br/>""Let me ask you something."" Allie said. “If you could retell your story, with the life you wanted. How would you tell it?"" <br/>“I wouldn't start it where I was born and raised. I would start it with a belief or something. Then I would tell people how my parents noticed I had a gift to see things and how they were made. But I would also tell how my dreams include being displayed, for my interpretation of various pieces of artwork. I mean look at the Guermica, in Madrid. That is one of the hardest pieces to take apart. Picasso had a true gift of thinking unlike everyone else."" <br/>""It is hard to describe what is going on in that picture. But your story sounds wonderful either way. Carter, you have the ability to take control of your life. Yes being a doctor is amazing, but that doesn't mean to dedicate your life to medical science. Medical design is a prosperous profession out there."" <br/>""Everyone's life is a piece of art. Many people will try to interpret for what they want it to be, and they will go on their lives thinking that is what that person is. Like the artist, the person could and will probably be perceived wrong, and if they continue thinking on what other people feed them, they will live their lives that way."" <br/>""Wow that is amazing. You have a creative mind too."" Allie said. She could finally see that there is more to Carter than she believed. She herself gave Carter a life story with little knowledge on him. </p>

<p> - Ils ne ressentent rien !, s’énerva Bazilio. Les Montholons les ont créés exprès pour servir de sujets d’expérience, il y a très longtemps. Vois-tu, ils ont une caractéristique unique. Ils sont magiques, tout comme leurs cousins les lutins, mais n’ont pas d’essence. La plupart des êtres magiques sont essentialistes. Ils ont leur propre essence magique. On ne peut pas en changer. Les sandestins, eux, sont existentialistes. Chez eux, l’existence précède l’essence. On peut leur donner l’essence magique qu’on veut, simplement en les enchantant. C’est ce qui les rend si utiles en magie expérimentale. Et puis ils sont aussi grégaires, et magicopètes.</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>Ils avaient commencé de manière très différente. Lupus Ofidius comme une fraternité de magiciens engagés dans le combat contre les ténèbres. Faerie comme une communauté de mages végétariens vénérant le Principe Créateur. L’épée vorpaline contre le lingam fleuri. L’ascèse combative contre la méditation créative. Les deux avaient su développer de nouvelles approches de la magie, faire reculer les limites du possible, transformer le continent en un monde plus sûr, où au lieu de se faire leur guérilla éternelle, les nains allaient maintenant travailler à l’usine d’objets magiques, et les orcs réglaient la circulation dans les rues.</p>

<p>Qui suivait la Route était seul dans la forêt des jours et des jours durant. La plupart des voyageurs amenés à faire un tel voyage le faisaient à contre coeur, et ne s'éloignaient pas des dalles du chemin. S'enfoncer dans la Forêt, c'était affronter l'inconnu. Toutes sortes d'histoires circulaient sur ce que le voyageur insensé trouvait sous les antiques frondaisons. On parlait d'arbres immenses devisant du temps, de lueurs mystérieuses attirant les imprudents dans des marécages sans retour dans lesquels se baignaient des beautés froides à la chevelure d'algues, d'anciens sites militaires protégés par des robots sauvages. On parlait de la cour du roi des ours où on exhibait les humains capturés chargés de chaînes, d'immenses villes souterraines de trolls prolétaires, de cercles de pierres levées recevant la visite des petits hommes gris des étoiles, de fées volant les chapeaux des voyageurs et emplissant leurs bottes de crapauds, de dragons veillant sur des cavernes emplies de jouets magiques.<br/>Des constructions s'élevaient audacieusement le long de la route, oeuvres d'humains ayant créé leur propre clairière, humbles chaumières jouxtant un enclos à cochons, châteaux envahis de lierre, creux dans les rochers où des ascètes crasseux recevaient leurs visions, cabanes bancales refuges de chats et de sorcières, monastères où l'on priait et brassait la bière, tours d'astrologue gravées de symboles cabalistiques, auberges accueillant le voyageur pour mieux le dévaliser la nuit.</p>

<p>Mon sang ne fit qu'un tour.<br/> - Troll, m'écriai-je (les trolls ne portent pas de nom), casse-lui le bras !<br/>Mais il s'était préparé. Le troll n'avait pas encore fait un geste (ils ont le cerveau lent) qu'il lui lançait :<br/> - Troll, je double ta ration de nourriture si tu entres à mon service.<br/>C'était bien tenté, et ça aurait pu marcher, mais ma connaissance supérieure de la psychologie de ces créatures perdit l'homme.<br/> - Troll, dis-je posément, je double tes jours de congés et en plus tu as le droit de lui manger le bras !</p>

Il était minuscule, tout rabougri et se tenait accroupi dans la position du lotus sur un coussin d'or.<br/>Tout autour de lui avait pris place le bureau des Délégués, composé d'une douzaine de gnomes arrivés à divers degrés de sagesse et de décrépitude, accroupis sur des coussins, et tenant chacun l'outil symbolisant leur fonction, qui une pioche, qui une masse d'arme, qui un crayon. Le maître avait pris place dans le cercle, aux côtés d'un gnome qu'il paraissait bien connaître, un gnome assez jeune à l'air éveillé tenant un télescope à la main et dénommé Tselmun.<br/> - Chers frères syndiqués, compagnons de lutte, commença le vieux Gobdo Khan d'une voix tremblante, nous sommes ici pour discuter d'un danger qui menace notre communauté.

Mais d'abord, je laisse la parole au Délégué Tuguldug qui va nous raconter une histoire qui pourra éclairer la décision sacrée que ce conseil prendra aujourd'hui. Frère Tuguldug, parlez !<br/>Tous les regards se tournèrent vers un vieux gnome d'allure timide qui tournait et retournait une cuillère en bois dans la main. Il s'éclaircit la voie et commença.</p>

Dans un sens. Puis dans l'autre. Les voix des conseillers, déjà peu joyeuses de nature, se faisaient monotones à mesure que la matinée s'écoulait.</span></span></span></p>

Seule la Reine Gallia penchait la tête, sourcils froncés et vague rictus sur les lèvres. Son sourire s'étira quand elle lâcha :</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Vous deviez être prise dans des pensées plus importantes que les problèmes de traitement de l'eau potable sur l'île orientale.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Gallia avait le sens de la formule, elle ne pouvait le nier. Elle n'en répondit qu'avec plus d'acidité :</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Facile de répondre ça quand on vit protégé dans un palais à Pzerion.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Les conseillers n'osaient plus bouger d'un cil, conscients que la prochaine pique risquait d'être accueillie par l'autre comme un affront à laver dans le sang.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">La Reine pinça les lèvres, cherchant visiblement une réponse. L'Impératrice ne se sentait pas d'humeur à supporter ses sempiternelles remontrances vis-à-vis de la politique extérieure : elle vivait à Pzerion et devait avant tout se consacrer à Pzerion, contre tout logique. À quoi bon posséder le titre d'Impératrice si elle n'avait pas plus de pouvoirs, et de devoirs, qu'une Reine ? Ses ancêtres s'étaient décidément bien perdus en route en refusant de prendre leurs responsabilités.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Joignant le geste à la parole, Jahanna se redressa, observa une seconde les quinze paires d'yeux ronds qui la dévisageaient, puis se leva avec énergie et se dirigea vers la splendide porte en chêne de la salle du conseil.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Vous n'avez donc aucune considération pour le peuple de Pzerion, ou pour ses dirigeants ? lança la Reine Gallia, visiblement courroucée.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Sans se détourner de sa route, l'Impératrice rétorqua :</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Vous l'aurez compris, j'ai d'autres préoccupations. Ceci dit, vous devriez avoir les mêmes : il s'agit des Hommes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Les lèvres pincées avec amertume, Jahanna s'éloigna à vive allure : elle avait l'incongrue et désagréable sensation de se comporter en enfant échappant à une remontrance de ses parents.</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Φ</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">L'Impératrice s'installa près de la fenêtre de la volière ; ses mains nerveuses cherchaient une surface plus rugueuse que la pierre lisse, sans succès. Les températures estivales arrivaient peu à peu et laissaient sur sa peau un souffle agréable, encore loin de l'insoutenable chaleur du mois d'ovocet.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Jahanna écarta une mèche de cheveux pastel et contempla le magnifique cercle de bois, de pierre et de métal qui s'étendait aussi loin que son regard se portait à l'ouest. Ses quelques escapades, déjà rares dans sa jeunesse, avaient quasiment cessé après la mort de sa mère et son accession au trône. Un rictus ironique entailla ses joues : quel trône ? En dehors de décisions futiles et de quelques cérémonies tape-à-l’œil, son rôle dans les hautes sphères des Sorcières demeurait bien limité. Mais elle comptait bien remédier à cela, même si cela lui prendrait toute sa vie.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Seriez-vous en train de vous cacher ?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">La voix grinçante de la Reine Gallia perçait dans son dos. Elle hésita une seconde, se força à garder une expression impassible et lui fit face. Cette Sorcière avait le double de son âge : ses cheveux gris clair, presque blancs, étaient serrés en un chignon qu'elle ornait d'une couronne dorée. Au milieu de son visage sec et ridé, ses yeux marrons gardaient ce ton froid qui rendait son regard si désagréable pour Jahanna.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Je ne me cache pas. Je me repose un peu. Toutes ces jacasseries me donnent mal à la tête.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">La Reine observa la volière autour d'elles ainsi que les oiseaux qui y piaillaient et la gratifia d'un regard ironique. Jahanna cacha son embarras derrière un sourire habile et insolent. Gallia le lui rendit, plus acide encore.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Vous devriez songer aux gens du cercle. Que penseraient-ils s'ils vous voyaient ainsi fuir vos responsabilités à leur égard ?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Mais voyons, nous savons bien que le peuple m'aime, rétorqua l'Impératrice.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Pour l'instant.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Le ton avait perdu son côté mielleux pour devenir tranchant comme une lame de rasoir ; le sourire de Gallia n'avait pourtant pas bougé.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Ils vous trouvent sympathique parce que vous êtes jeune et que vous avez un esprit faussement révolutionnaire, mais ils ne réalisent pas que vous êtes obnubilée par Itera et le continent. Rendez-vous service : acceptez de suivre la tradition mise en place par vos ancêtres et concentrez vos efforts sur le grand cercle. C'est le cœur de notre civilisation.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Mais notre civilisation ne s'arrête pas là. Mon rôle est justement de...</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Votre rôle, l'interrompit la Reine, consiste à montrer à nos ennemis que toutes les Sorcières sont unies. Bien sûr, si vous pouvez faciliter la collaboration entre les cercles, c'est une très bonne chose, mais cessez de rêvasser le regard au loin, par-delà les mers. Votre place est ici.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Jahannna la laissa finir sa leçon de morale : on lui avait toujours appris qu'une personne qui ne coupait pas la parole à l'autre gagnait en prestance en démontrant ainsi une grande notion de respect. Elle cherchait aussi le meilleur moyen de détruire son argumentation, mais alors qu'elle s'apprêtait à lui rappeler que son rang était supérieur au sien et qu'elle n'avait aucun ordre à recevoir de sa part, Gallia reprit :</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Et n'oubliez pas que si le peuple vous aime, ce n'est pas franchement le cas des nobles... Et ce sont eux qui ont un pouvoir décisionnel ici. Vous et moi ne sommes rien face à cela.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">L'Impératrice crut déceler une insistance sur le mot « vous ». L'aristocratie vieillissante de Pzerion commençait en effet à démontrer une vive antipathie à son égard à cause des réformes égalitaristes qu'elle souhaitait mettre en œuvre. Les Sorcières en question craignait d'assister à un total chamboulement de leur système de valeurs ; et surtout de devoir dire adieu à leurs privilèges en tant que femmes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Soyez raisonnable, termina la Reine.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Elle tourna les talons sans autre forme de procès et sortit de la volière. Jahanna, une peu hébétée par ce qu'elle venait d'entendre, demeura immobile. Seule sa lourde respiration et les roucoulements des volatiles troublaient le silence. Enfin, elle se décida à emprunter la même route que l'autre souveraine et passa la porte de bois pour retourner à ses quartiers. Dehors, elle retrouva deux membres de sa garde personnelle, qu'elle fustigea :</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">— <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Quand je dis que je ne veux pas être dérangée, ça signifie que personne ne doit m'approcher. Pas même la Reine Gallia.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">« Surtout pas la Reine Gallia » ajouta-t-elle en silence. Cette Sorcière était un vrai poison. Un long soupir s'échappa de ses lèvres entrouvertes ; de lassitude, mais aussi de soulagement à l'idée d'avoir échappé à une confrontation plus longue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">En décortiquant ses palabres, Jahanna ressentait un malaise grandissant. Les murs du palais impérial semblaient se rapprocher, comme pour l'engloutir sous une tonne de pierres et de secrets. Elle accéléra l'allure pour se réfugier dans sa chambre. Ses gardes la talonnaient, mais elle aurait donné cher pour se retrouver seule en cet instant. Quand elle parvint enfin devant les lourds battants de ses quartiers, elle s'insinua par l'ouverture et la referma aussi vite que sèchement.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Adossée contre le bois peint, elle souffla un instant, heureuse de retrouver son intimité. Ses yeux se baladèrent sur la pièce à vivre pavée de marbre : deux méridiennes au tissu bleu foncé entouraient une simple table de bois et de verre. Quelques fruits déposés dans une corbeille attendaient que personne ne les mange. Rares étaient les personnes qui venaient lui rendre visite, aussi les coussins qui jonchaient les canapés semblaient encore neufs.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Un courant d'air vint soulever les rideaux colorés à l'une des fenêtres. Jahanna se précipita pour la fermer et s'assura de pouvoir utiliser la magie en s'entourant d'un bouclier astral. Elle inspecta ainsi chaque recoin de ses appartements avant de s’asseoir sur son large lit. Les draps venaient d'être changer pour du coton léger, dans des tons plus lumineux. La souveraine s'étala jusqu'à sentir la moindre de ses vertèbres s'enfoncer dans le matelas. Les yeux rivés sur le plafond peint en volutes insaisissables, elle respira profondément, soucieuse.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Plus que vers la Reine et sa conception archaïque de la société sorcière, c'était contre ses prédécesseurs que son amertume se dirigeait. S'ils n'avaient pas fait de l'inaction une philosophie, sa situation aurait été différente ; celle de l'ensemble des Sorcières aussi. Certaines paroles de la Reine Gallia masquaient à peines ses menaces : sa référence à la noblesse prouvait bien qu'elle bénéficiait d'appuis politiques non négligeables. Elle lui mettrait des bâtons dans les roues à la moindre occasion. Il fallait espérer qu'elle n'irait pas plus loin.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Jahanna ferma les yeux avec lassitude. L'angoisse d'une attaque commanditée par des opposants politiques l'étreignait depuis l'enfance, mais elle ne l'avait jamais ressentie de façon aussi brute.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Il lui fallait du sang neuf dans son entourage.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Nu devant le lavabo, le corps encore trempé de sueurs froides, le Prêtre se passa de l'eau sur le visage. Ses mains tremblaient encore et il s'obligeait à les serrer aussi fort que possible dans l'espoir qu'elles cessent enfin. Il n'osa pas affronter le miroir devant lui, il savait déjà quelle image il lui renverrait.<br/> Dalen avait encore rêvé de sa mère.<br/> Parfois, il était saisi de cauchemars, de souvenirs qui entouraient son ancienne vie, de cette femme qu'il avait quittée vingt ans plus tôt. Cette femme qui occupait encore une bonne partie de ses songes.<br/> Jamais elle ne prononçait le moindre mot. Sa belle bouche pâle ne s'ouvrait pas, ne souriait jamais, figée dans cette expression neutre qu'il avait lui-même finit par adopter. Non, ce n'étaient pas ses paroles qui le hantaient.<br/> Il s'agissait de son regard. Des saphirs aïckois... Ces mêmes yeux dont il avait hérité et qu'il désirait chaque jour arracher de leurs orbites.<br/> — Dalen Tarah... Dalen Tarah...<br/> Il répéta ainsi ce nom qui n'était pas vraiment le sien, ce nom que les Hauts-Prêtres avaient choisi pour lui. Il l'avait accepté, s'y était accoutumé et avait même fini par en apprécier les sonorités. Mais il ne parvenait pas à effacer de sa mémoire celui qu'il avait reçu le jour où il avait poussé son premier cri.<br/> Les tremblements dans ses mains cessèrent. Dalen se ressaisit enfin et retourna dans sa chambre. Même s'ils constituaient une minorité, la plupart des Prêtres dans sa situation présentait ce genre de troubles. Il avait entendu parler d'anorexie, de dépressions, de suicides... Pour la plupart durant l'adolescence. Arrivé à vingt-sept ans, Dalen se doutait qu'il ne constituait plus une menace pour lui-même.<br/> Le Prêtre lança un regard en direction de la fenêtre : le jour n'allait pas tarder à se lever. S'il ne voulait pas être retardé pour son départ, il devait se rendre à la Citadelle de Cristal avant le reste de ses confrères. Il s'habilla à la hâte et sortit sans même prendre le temps de verrouiller sa porte.<br/> La fraîcheur ambiante enroba sa peau dès qu'il sortit du bâtiment.

Quelle drôle d’idée.)</p><p>Pour récupérer la belle, l’armée de Terra Nova, le cartel Vilasis et le roi d’Antée envoient leur meilleur espion pour infiltrer les rangs des pirates… meilleur espion qui n’est autre que Noemi Vilasis, la sœur d’Ash.</p><p>Noemi, très professionnellement, ne tarde pas à localiser Lora, et monte un plan parfait pour la libérer des griffes des pirates.</p><p>Sauf que…</p>

<p>The Top NOWD Donor Novel (complete! 70,062 words)</p><p>Something about magic harnessed for political purposes and a kid going to investigate.</p><p><em>The Shuttershock Worlds</em> (rewrite, in progress) :</p><p>When you take a photo, you are freezing that instant. Now imagine that when a photo is taken of you, an alternate version of you is created. This alternate version of you continues to live life based on the whims of that instant and continues to grow, live, and learn. This person could turn out to be similar or completely different based on which other alternate people they interact with.

<p>The beginning of <em>The Shuttershock Worlds</em>:</p><p>Brooke always knew something was different in the world. After all, Brooke was a scientist, and solving the world's mysteries is part of the job description for the scientist. Setting up experiments, solving multivariable math equations, thinking of new ideas... it was all part of the scientific lifestyle, one that isn't just a job but a lens with which to view the world.</p><p>Some things, however, take more than some elbow grease and a few million dollars in funding to discover. They take an underground bunker, a thick skin, and... okay, they still take a few million dollars to fund. So when Brooke's working grant expired and she still didn't have a working portal, she began to panic. How could she continue this project?</p><p>That's when she pursued it as a side job to her regular science duties. The good thing about working in a lab is the free time it offers you. Experiments take time to run, people are busy helping out on other experiments, and all this left Brooke with at least an hour a day to work on equations and request materials with no mention of what the materials were being used for. They could all be used just as easily in her current work... you know, the stuff she was getting paid to do.</p><p>No one really believed in Brooke's work. When her coworkers found out, they all said it was a bunch of hogwash that hadn't been proven yet. That was the exact point of science: Nothing could be proven, but it could be tested over and over until it becomes a law like gravity did.</p><p>Still, despite finding Brooke's side work to be ridiculous and not worth funding, they were still curious about how it was going.</p><p>""You discovered any parallel universes yet?"" they would ask. ""Bet you've already gotten the answers to everything in these parallel worlds.""</p><p>And then Brooke would argue that while the worlds were parallel, they weren't parallel in an Euclidean fashion, much how the universe they live in wasn't perfectly flat, or so they believed. Which made this study a particularly enlightening one, a study of other words far beyond our own. Maybe Brooke wouldn't find anything, but you know what? That was okay. The pursuit of knowledge and whatever one would learn along the way was what made this study so fascinating.</p><p>""No one's ever done this before,"" Brooke would say, showing off all the diagrams and items she was building. One diagram showed a portal gun the size of a laboratory telescope, so big that it required an entire room. Brooke hadn't actually built this yet, mostly because she was still working on a portal gun the size of a, well, gun. Something she could carry around easily between universes. The portalscope left the probability of being stuck in one universe way higher than she would like, and that was just unacceptable. What if she couldn't rebuild the portal gun? What if the universe was so different the materials to rebuild the portal gun no longer existed? And she was stuck there forever without a way to come home?</p><p>But she would show them, Brooke would think. She would find these parallel universes that no one willing to fund the research for and show them wrong. Other scientists have come out of nowhere with ideas that worked. Brooke could too, and she would prove her critics wrong no matter what.</p>

<p>The beginning of the robot romance: <br/><br/>Sam's muscles ached as he dug his shovel into the ground and lifted. Why didn't they have machines for this yet, the most arduous part of the mining process? he wondered as a pile of dirt emerged with the shovel. He dumped the dirt in a large container and peered inside it.<br/>A job as boring as this one wouldn't haven't been so bad if digging weren't his only job, he decided while giving the dirt a long hard look. Even the people who oversaw the separation process received some break from the monotony while picking apart the good materials from the cruft. And the truth was, the dirt was mostly just that: dirt.<br/>But Sam kept digging, transferring dirt from the ground to the pile above even though the process was mostly in vain. He felt a pang of pain in his shoudler and set his shovel down for a minute to look at the dirt.<br/>""You ever think about why we're doing this?"" a guy wearing a yellow hard hat asked Sam. Sam wasn't wearing a hard hat; he hadn't earned that privilege yet.<br/>""Every day,"" Sam replied. ""They say we're digging for metals, but do you really think that's the case?""<br/>""Sure,"" the man in the hard hat replied. ""Why wouldn't it be? You see metals everywhere. The buildings we live in, the electronics we use, the robots that live among us. What I'm wondering is why one of those robots couldn't be doing this job instead. Surely they could do a faster job at it than us."" The man in the hard hat planted his shovel in the ground by his side. ""There's gotta be a reason we're doing it instead.""<br/>Sam shrugged. He shouldn't have done that since it made his shoulders hurt. ""Probably so the government can say they're creating jobs,"" he replied. ""You know they love to exaggerate those claims.""<br/>A voice in the distance yelled at them. ""I ain't payin' you to chit chat all day!""<br/>The man in the hard hat sighed. ""Guess we better get back to it,"" he said as they picked up their shovels. ""But I still don't see why we can't get robots to take our jobs. This one was made for them.""<br/>Sam filled in the blanks. ""Boring, repetitive, no intellectual gain to be had, right?""<br/>""I didn't mean it like that,"" the man in the hard hat said. ""I know how you feel about those robots."" He tossed a pile of dirt aside and ignored when it didn't land entirely on the pile it was supposed to land on.<br/>""And we both know,"" Sam said as he planted the shovel in hte ground again, feeling a bigger pain in his upper back, ""that robots are just as valuable as humans. Just as complex. Just as potentially intelligent. Just as likely to incite chaos. They're complex creatures, robots are."" He flung the dirt on the shovel on the pile of dirt, ignoring the pain his body was screaming back.<br/>""I don't know if you can call them complex,"" the man in the hard hat said. ""Your robots will take over the world one day and then where will we humans be?""<br/>Sam stuck the shovel in the ground for another attempt at shoveling. ""Probably just where we were before,"" he replied. ""Surviving against nature and our own creations. Nothing has changed. Nothing will change.""<br/>They fell silent, and Sam continued to shovel on his own for the rest of the day, greeting any attempts at conversation with unpleasant grunts. Shovel in the ground, shovel out. Shovel in, shovel out. He didn't have to like the job, but he could at least do the best job he could without dealing with everyone else.<br/>When the five o'clock bell rang, he grabbed his shovel and walked as fast as his painful body would allow to the shovel return site. Forget waking up and looking forward to getting to work every day, shovel return time was what Sam looked forward to.<br/>A line of men with shovels in their right hands stood in front of Sam, all waiting for the shovel return. The line inched forward too slowly for Sam's comfort, but he had to admit that it was moving along more quickly than when he first started digging holes or whatever it was that he did there. The men with the holes closest to teh front had the advantage, but unfortunately that wasn't a position to be held by juniors like Sam. He woudl have to work long and hard and do something before gaining one of those coveted positions. Maybe find something valuable. He wasn't sure yet, but bribing the higher-ups was probably involved.<br/>Finally Sam could see the front of the line, and a minute later, he was at the front of the line.<br/>A set of closed metal doors stood in front of Sam, along with a glowing wall to the left and a closed box on the floor to the right. Sam stepped up to the door, placed his left hand on the glowing wall, stared at the wall straight ahead, and waited.<br/>""Barker, Samuel L,"" a robotic female voice read. ""All clear for departure. Please drop your--""<br/>""Yeah yeah, I get it,"" Sam said over the voice. The box on the floor opened to just the right size to fit a shovel, and he dropped the shovel inside. The door in front of him opened.<br/>He was free. Free! Free from the prison that was work and free to go home for the evening and do whatever he damn well pleased, which would probably include watching TV and playing games.<br/>Free, that is, until eight o'clock the next morning, when he would show up in line to the field, take his shovel, and do the same thing again for nine hours, all with unpaid breaks.<br/>Sam walked down the street, passing streetlamps, other people making the first shift commute home from work, people making a second shift commute to work, and other people heading to a destination that wasn't work. Billboards, mostly animated ones with news tickers on the bottom, filled the sky space above buildings, and Sam found himself stopping to watch when he got a glimpse of something interesting. Today Sam walked down the street, and as he turned the corner to his house a news ticker read ROBOT HUMANS NOW IN OUR FUTURE, SCIENTISTS PREDICT.<br/>Sam stopped short. Robot humans? What was this beautiful thing this news ticker was saying? <br/>And more importantly, how could he be one?</p>

Can she stay alive?</p>

<p>From An Unauthorized Autobiography:<br/><br/>It really was too bad that I was about to kill her. How much flirting is appropriate with someone you're about to murder, anyway? I feel like there should be a protocol on this, but in all of the family discussions on this matter, no one ever brought up the sensitive topic of killing someone you've flirted with. Still, such a protocol has to exist, and that night I decided to create one.<br/><br/>One, do not, under any circumstances, tell that person you are about to kill them. This should be common sense, but you might be surprised how many people violate this very common sense principle. This is probably because common sense isn't all that common these days. Common cents, however, are extremely common. Telling someone you're flirting with that you're about to kill them not only tells them that you have no long-term commitment plans with them, but it also tells them that you have absolutely no regard for their life. Avoid at all costs.<br/><br/>Two, avoid making death jokes. Come on, this should also be common sense. It's like making death jokes at a funeral. ""It's not going to kill me"" (something I've had the misfortune of making before) can be funny in ordinary circumstances but is inappropriate in places where death is a theme, even for one of you. Even if the other person has no idea what's coming for them, making excessive jokes about death is best avoided. If the other person makes such a joke and you don't know how to react, it's best to react as if you're not about to kill them. However you would react to anyone else making such a joke in normal non-death circumstances would be appropriate.<br/><br/>Third, consider the environment. Are you flirting with them in a graveyard. Big no-no. Same for going on an outing to anything majorly involving death. You don't want it to give too many anvil-sized hints.<br/><br/>Disregard all of the above if you'd like to give anvil-sized hints. Sometimes those can be fun, but other times it can be creepy, especially when the other person says, ""Gee, you really find fascinating, don't you?"" This will probably lead to awkward responses on your end, so it's probably best to take my advice gained from experience and avoid the D-word altogether.<br/><br/>There's probably one other topic you're probably wondering about. What about getting it on? Let's face it, you may want to put off killing someone you have feelings for, and that's completely understandable. That's how I'm feeling at the moment with this case. But if you find yourself wanting to advance your feelings to the physical level, consider how attached you'll feel after killing them. If you think you'll be really attached after their death due to the physical activity, then reconsider this activity for both of your sakes. Do you really want to get physical, snuggle afterward, and then drive a knife into her back? Really?<br/><br/>I didn't think so.<br/><br/>Now let's see if I can take my own advice.</p>

<p><br/>From Adventures in Wrimonia:<br/>“I need a plot!” Mia mumbled to herself. “But where am I going to find one?” She nearly ran into a man wearing a pink suit and carrying a magic wand. That wasn’t the first thing she noticed about him, though. She hadn’t been here long, but the first thing she noticed about this man was the lack of name tag.<br/>“Sorry,” he said. “I was just on my way to rush to someone’s side. They needed to know who I am.”<br/>“Who you are?” Mia asked. “How can they tell? You don’t have a name tag.”<br/>“Ah, you must be new,” the man said. Mia took great offense to this as he adjusted the collar on his shirt. “My name is Mr. Ian Woon.”<br/>“Uh, hi, Mr. Woon, I’m Mia,” Mia said, extending her hand for a handshake.<br/>“No, that’s Mr. Ian Woon,” he said, not holding out his hand. Mia let her hand down.<br/>“Okay, fine, good to meet you, Mr. Ian Woon. So who exactly are you? And how’d you get away with not wearing a single name tag in this place? They sneaked a guest name tag on me before I registered.”<br/>“Oh, I’m not doing NaNoWriMo,” he said. “I’m a tradition around here.”<br/>“A tradition?”<br/>“Yes,” Mr. Ian Woon said. “Every year Wrimos everywhere include me in their novel. They can do whatever they want to me. Some use me as a major character. Some use me as a passing name when they need one. Some even kill me.” Mr. Ian Woon took off his jacket and revealed a wound on his sleeve. The blood had crusted over. Mia cringed.<br/>“Have you gotten that cleaned up? I’m sure someone could--”<br/>“No, it’s just fine,” Mr. Ian Woon replied. “I’m still recovering from all the Wrimos who decided to kill me last year. It has to be quick, though, since November’s coming and they may want to kill me again. One person killed me with a rusty titanium spork. A spork. They even made me get tetanus before dying, but they never told me that, no way.”<br/>Mia shook her head. “So do they all meet you before killing you? That’s not very kind.”<br/>“Of course they do. Some are just a little more crass than others.”<br/>“That’s always good to know,” Mia mumbled. She didn’t want Mr. Ian Woon to hear this, but apparently he did anyway, as his ears perked up.<br/>“So if I include you in my novel, what do I get?”<br/>“I get another cameo in someone’s novel. You get another character. It’s win-win.”<br/>“Sure, unless you get killed.” Mia thought back to her own writing. She hadn’t been doing much of it recently, but she had never killed anyone in a work of fiction.<br/>“Well, that’s enough about me. What about you? Do you know how I’ll show up in your novel yet?”<br/>“I don’t even know what I’m writing about yet. I just showed up here today and you expect me to know? Jeepers.”<br/>Mr. Ian Woon shrugged. “It never hurts to ask,” he said. “Besides, some people come in with ideas created years in advance. Crazy, I tell you...” He looked around. “But it’s all okay. As long as you figure out something.”<br/>“Yeah, I hope so,” Mia said. “I have just three weeks.”<br/>“Well, I have to go,” Mr. Ian Woon said. “It was great talking to you, but there’s someone in the All-Ages Coffeehouse who still doesn’t know who I am. As if they couldn’t see the thread that sushimustwrite posted about me in the Reaching 50,000 forum. Silly Wrimos...” Mr. Ian Woon ran off without so much as a goodbye.<br/>“That was rude,” Mia said to herself. She looked around. She was still standing in front of the Realism building. Wrimos, as she now took to calling these crazy people running between buildings, were running around, some entering and exiting buildings, some disappearing to a place she couldn’t quite tell.<br/>How am I going to do this, anyway? Mia asked herself. I haven’t written anything longer than what could fit on a post-it note since my college papers, and suddenly I’m expected to write a book in a month. This is crazy.</p>

<p>The hunt had lasted almost a day. Those fleeing were outnumbered as well as out-skilled, but they ran for their lives while those hunting them ran for the kill. Only one caught up with them before they crossed the border and stepped into safety. The young man followed them, ignoring the low stone wall now more a marking than an actual barrier between the two countries.

He screamed when the others others left him behind.</p><p>Shade ran past the wounded man without stopping, his eyes on the leader of the pack and the fighting child she carried.

<p><br/>Picking the lock of the chains holding her was Tea's first mistake. She made sure her owner didn't notice when he handed out the breakfast. Since Tea and Frey were the youngest, they got the smallest part of the loaf he distributed throughout the camp.

<p>Her head pounded as he staggered past the last fragments of the buildings. So far away from the explosion the buildings had only sustained minor damage, indistinct from the already broken facades.

<p>Bård, fils de Sigurd, se blottit contre le poitrail de l'animal. Fatigué après ses frayeurs et sa fuite, il avait besoin d'un peu de réconfort. La louve pencha sa tête vers l'enfant et lui adressa un coup de langue affectueux. Quelque peu rassénéré, il se pelotonna plus avant contre l'immense bête. Elle était plus grande que le plus grand cheval et aurait pu ne faire de lui qu'une bouchée. Pourtant, lorsque les ennemis de sa famille avaient voulu le tuer, elle l'avait sauvé. Il était dos au mur, face à un adulte armé d'une épée et là, elle avait jailli de nulle part, traversant un rideau de flamme, égorgeant et piétinnant les assaillants. Après avoir éparpillé ses adversaires, elle s'était emparée de lui et l'avait emmené loin de la tourmente. D'abord tétanisé de terreur en se retrouvant dans la gueule du loup, il avait hurlé pendant longtemps. En constatant qu'elle ne le dévorait pas, il avait fini par se rassurer. Et puis, il était grand maintenant : à huit ans révolus, il ne devait plus avoir peur.</p>
<p>Il bâilla. Le visage enfoui dans la fourrure de sa protectrice, le garçon chercha désespérément le sommeil. Mais les évènements de la journée se bousculaient dans sa tête, trop nombreux et trop terribles. Il s'agita. La louve lui adressa de tendres poussées de museau. Il eût une soudaine envie de pleurer. Retrouverait-il ses parents le lendemain ? Et qu'est ce qu'un animal, aussi géant soit-il, pouvait comprendre aux tourments humains ?</p>
<p>""Plus que tu ne le crois, petit d'homme, dit la louve. J'ai déjà perdu de mes proches, et ton père était un grand ami à moi.</p>
<p>- Mais tu... tu parles ! s'exclama Bård sidéré d'entendre une voix humaine jaillir de la gueule d'un tel fauve.</p>
<p>- Oui, confirma sa terrible interlocutrice en retroussant les babines dans une forme de sourire. Je suis ce que vous autres, humains, appelez un Vane. Enfin, une Vane en l'occurence."" Le garçon en resta bouche bée. Il se trouvait en présent d'un animal mythique, un esprit protecteur de la nature, et cet animal lui avait sauvé la vie. Comment son père avait-il pu devenir l'ami d'un monstre pareil ?</p>
<p>""Vous connaissiez mon père ? s'enquit Bård.</p>
<p>- Le grand Sigurd oui, répondit la louve. Il m'avait informée de la naissance de son fils, Bård. Son odeur est très présente sur toi."" Elle le renifla, comme pour vérifier ses dires. ""Je me nomme Fen, reprit-elle. Tu peux m'appeler ainsi. J'ai l'impression que nous allons passer un petit moment ensemble.</p>
<p>- Combien de temps ? s'inquiéta le garçon qui avait envie de retrouver sa parentèle le plus rapidement possible.</p>
<p>- Je ne sais."" Le regard qu'elle lui lança en disant ses mots était insondable. ""Pour le moment tu devrais dormir, tu es en sécurité avec moi.</p>
<p>- Je veux aller voir mon père ! Décréta Bård qui commençait à s'alarmer.</p>
<p>- Nous le verrons demain, lui assura la louve. Je te promets de te ramener à lui, d'accord ?""</p>
<p>L'enfant finit par hocher affirmativement la tête, un peu à contrecoeur. Tant les propos que le regard mystérieux de Fen l'avaient inquiété. Mais il avait donné son accord. Il se réinstalla entre les pattes avant de la louve, le plus confortablement qu'il pouvait. Elle dégagea une de ses pattes pour le serrer contre elle. Epuisé et au chaud blotti dans la généreuse fourrure de la Vane, Bård perdit la lutte contre le sommeil et sombra bientôt dans les ténèbres.</p>
<p>Les timides rayons de soleil qui s'infiltraient dans la petite caverne éveillèrent le petit garçon tard le lendemain. Il ouvrit les yeux, surpris de ne pas sentir les odeurs habituelles de repas du matin. ""Père ?"" Appela-t-il avant de se souvenir qu'il ne se trouvait pas dans son lit. La petite décharge d'adrénaline qui en suivit le mit tout de suite sur pied, dégageant la patte de la louve qui le tenait au chaud. Bård eût un sursaut de terreur de se retrouver face à face avec l'immense carnassier, avant que son cerveau encore endormi ne l'informe que Fen lui avait sauvé la vie la veille. ""Tu as dormi longtemps, commenta celle ci. Tu devais en avoir besoin.</p>
<p>- Euh... Oui."" En convint il.</p>
<p>La Vane se leva à son tour, s'étira longuement et bâilla de tous ses crocs. ""Je veux voir mon père."" Recommença Bård. Il avait faim et d'être sorti du chaleureux cocon de fourrure le faisait frissonner de tous ses membres, mais un sentiment d'urgence le pressait. Il devait retrouver sa famille avant toute autre chose. La louve lui adressa un regard scrutateur de ses yeux d'or et hocha la tête. ""Soit."" Dit-elle avant de sortir de la caverne. Le garçon lui emboîta aussitôt le pas. Dehors, ils constatèrent qu'un peu de givre recouvrait le sol. Il fondait sous le soleil, mais cela annonçait l'arrivée du froid. La Vane inspira profondément l'air des alentours. ""Mmmh, ça sent la neige on dirait. Nous ferions mieux de ne pas traîner. Monte sur mon dos, ainsi nous irons plus vite.</p>
<p>- D'accord.""</p>
<p>Fen se coucha pour que son petit protégé puisse grimper car, debout, elle était bien trop haute. Une fois qu'elle se fut assurée qu'il était bien installé et fermement arrimé à la fourrure de son garrot, elle se lança. D'un petit pas d'abord, qu'elle allongea au fur et à mesure qu'elle constatait que l'enfant tenait bon. Il avait peur de tomber, aussi serrait il de toutes ses forces les poils de sa monture, mais il était décidé. Il ne se rendit pas compte de l'allure phénoménale que Fen avait adopté comme vitesse de croisière. De fait, elle courrait plus vite qu'un loup normal et pouvait tenir cette cadence plus longtemps. De tout le trajet, le garçon s'accrocha courageusement et avec opiniâtreté.</p>
<p>""Que se passe-t-il ? S'enquit il lorsqu'il remarqua que la louve avait ralenti le pas.</p>
<p>- Chut, ne fait pas de bruit, lui ordonna-t-elle. Nous sommes proches de chez toi et il reste peut-être des ennemis. Nous allons nous montrer discrets."" L'enfant avait peur mais il avait décidé de se montrer courageux. Et puis, que craignait-il avec une Vane pour compagne ? Il s'efforça de faire le moins de bruit possible, toujours accroché de toutes ses forces à sa monture. A présent, Fen marchait précautionneusement et s'arrêtait à intervalles réguliers pour renifler l'air autour d'elle. Bård se demandait ce qu'elle pouvait bien sentir car, lui, ne percevait que l'odeur du feu qui avait ravagé son village la veille. Les oreilles de la louve étaient aussi sans cesse en mouvement. Mais de même, lui n'entendait que les lamentations du vent.</p>
<p>""Surtout, ne descend pas avant que je te le dise."" Chuchota Fen à l'intention de son petit cavalier au moment où ils entraient dans le village ravagé. Elle avait bien fait de le mettre en garde car, à cet instant il n'avait envie que d'une chose, et c'était de se précipiter à terre pour courir jusqu'au hall de son père. D'ailleurs, il serait probablement passé outre l'interdiction de la Vane s'il n'y avait pas tant de corps éparpillés sur la terre battue. Il craignait d'avoir reconnu Rolf le forgeron parmi eux. Mais comme il était face contre terre, l'enfant n'en était pas certain. Quoiqu'il en soit, le probable Rolf était entouré des corps de plusieurs assaillants ; il avait vendu chèrement sa vie. Craignant de reconnaître d'autres personnes qu'il connaissait, l'enfant enfouit son visage dans le cou de sa protectrice. Se morigénant de réagir comme un bébé, il releva bientôt la tête. Il ne pouvait quand même se résoudre à regarder les cadavres, alors il fixa son regard sur son objectif : chez lui.</p>
<p>Aussi silencieuse qu'une ombre, la louve se coula de maison en maison jusqu'à la demeure de son vieil ami Sigurd. Contrairement à certaines habitations du village, le hall qu'elle visait ne brûlait pas. Sans pitié pour l'impatience du garçon qui, pour le moment, faisait des efforts surhumains pour rester coi, elle n'entra pas tout de suite par la porte ouverte. Elle craignait de tomber sur les pillards survivants qui seraient restés passer la nuit aux frais de leurs victimes. Etaient ils vraiment de simples pillards, d'ailleurs, elle n'en était pas certaine. Elle songeait à l'éventualité que son ami ait été agressé à des fins plus personnelles. Bien évidemment, elle ne pouvait pas en être certaine, mais son instinct lui criait qu'elle avait raison. De plus, elle aurait préféré venir faire ses investigations sans le petit, Bård. Mais elle subodorait que si elle l'avait laissé, il aurait tenté de la suivre. Et, seul dans les bois, il se serait probablement perdu ou fait une mauvaise rencontre. Mieux valait qu'elle le garde auprès d'elle.</p>
<p>Elle était contrariée. L'odeur du feu et des cendres envahissait tout et elle n'arrivait pas à déterminer la présence ou non d'humains vivants. Heureusement, les morts n'avaient pas encore commencé à sentir trop fort, mais cela s'avérait une bien piètre consolation face au carnage qui s'offrait à eux. Tant pis. Il allait falloir entrer chez Sigurd malgré le danger potentiel, sinon le petit risquait de se précipiter en courant et en criant le nom de son père partout. Elle avait beau être une Vane, ses instincts de loup étaient très forts et elle devait réprimer son réflexe de gronder. Elle poussa la porte entr’ouverte et s’aventura à l’intérieur. L’inquiétude du petit Bård faisait écho à la sienne : elle sentit ses jambes se crisper sur ses flancs.</p>
<p>Un feu crépitait dans l’immense cheminée de la grande salle. Fen s’immobilisa, son coeur se fendant dans sa poitrine lupine. Sigurd, son vieil ami, était là. Mais mort, ses mains et ses pieds cloués au mur. Au moment où l’idée d’empêcher le fils d’assister à ce spectacle lui effleurait l’esprit, celui ci poussa un grand cri, “Père !” et glissa au sol pour se précipiter vers le cadavre exposé de son géniteur. A son hurlement de désespoir, des formes se mirent à bouger un peu partout dans la pièce. Toute à son effarement, la louve n’avait pas vu les gens qui dormaient dans les ombres de la salle à son entrée. “Le monstre !” s’exclama l’un d’entre eux. Fondant sur Bård, elle l’attrapa par le surcôt afin de l’emmener loin de cette scène et du danger.</p>

<p>PART TWO ENGLAND</p>
<p>The peaceful verdant landscape with its rolling hills and meadows rushed past. The splattering of the rain on the train window subdued the view with a halo of enchantment. I followed this strange scenery and now and again, caught the flickering of my eyes in the window’s reflection. Everything was so different to what I was used to. The high peaks and strong light of the Alps had been substituted by the mild and rural hue of Oxfordshire.</p>

<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE - THE TRUTH</strong></p><p>The outside world was barely visible due to the mist covering the windows. Tiny snowflake-like crystals mapped the glass and gave the outside world an enchanted dimension.</p><p>I was feverishly anticipating the icy air of the French Alps and the smell of burning leaves that would hit me my senses met with the open air again.</p><p>I was desperate to get out, exhilarated by the thought of what was waiting for me at home. Well, I hoped so at least. Two days to my birthday. Not just any birthday. My sixteenth one. My mother had promised something very special, and I had a small idea as to what it would be.</p><p>I felt butterflies in my stomach and grew even more eager to escape the confining walls. I was overflowing with waves of adrenalin and desperately wanted to get past those doors, which seemed still so far away.</p><p>All round, the bustling crowd of school hooligans were pressing against me and shoving me along. I nearly tripped over and felt a jolt of pain as I hit my shin on the step, only just managing to keep my balance.</p><p>There it was at last. A draught of cold air reached my nostrils, its pureness so sharp it was almost exhilarating. I couldn’t wait to be free again, to return to the comfort of my room and personal haven.</p><p>Then I saw it. The boxy green car was unmistakably there. Maybe, if I closed my eyes and opened them again it would disappear. I even tried, but it didn’t work. Our green car hadn’t budged.</p><p>My face felt suddenly very hot. I imagined everyone stopping in their tracks all of a sudden to stare at me instead of running for the school bus. I was furious. I wanted to disappear there and then, be swallowed up by the crowd.</p><p>“I can’t believe this! What is she doing here!” I desperately hissed under my breath catching a glimpse of my mother through the fogged up window of the car. “Doesn’t it cross her mind that I’m nearly sixteen, and that mothers are a total embarrassment for teenagers.”</p><p>I slipped discreetly past the caretaker at the door, walked as inconspicuously as I could towards the car and hastily opened the door to the back seat trying to master one of my most annoyed expressions. I was seething inside and ready for a battle.</p><p><br/>My eyes met my mother’s in the reflection of the rear view mirror and my angered expression froze. I must have looked like a cartoon figure after someone pushes the pause button. I abruptly felt the cold despite of the heat in the car.</p><p>There was something very very wrong with those red rimmed eyes. Her expression chilled me to the bone. I shot a side glance towards Sylvia, my two year younger sister. She just stared back at me, her face slightly paler than ashes.</p><p>I felt a surge of panic as I met her eyes. The atmosphere was stifling, unreal. I couldn’t breathe. I needed to smell that sharp, fresh air that had welcomed me a few moments before.</p><p>The car was usually a boiling pot of chatter, everyone wanting to get a word in at once. Today, there was just an awkward silence, and my mother’s unrecognizable expression. Her face was a shade paler than Sylvia’s.</p><p>My state of panic grew stronger. I desperately wanted to know what was wrong, yet one part of me didn’t want to know at all.</p><p>I swallowed with difficulty, and tentatively asked, “Is there anything I should know about, coz I feel kind of left out?”</p><p>As I spoke those words, I knew for sure I didn’t really want an answer.</p><p> </p><p>“Daddy hit mummy,” Sylvia matter-of-factly.</p><p> </p><p>I swallowed hard again. Where was all this saliva coming from, when my throat felt parched beyond reason.</p><p> </p><p>“He dragged mummy by her hair and she fell over, hit her head and has burn marks on her back.” “I hate him,” she added as a conclusion to the event.</p><p> </p><p>That was when I really panicked. A wave of anxiety swept over me as I realized who was missing. Where was Raphael, my baby brother? I like to call him my baby brother, just to bug him. He is only eight, so I mean he’s a kid I’m a responsible teenager, but he’s a really a cool kid and so bright for his age. Basically, I adore him.</p><p> </p><p>Strange, I didn’t feel anxious for my mother. Why? Maybe because behind that blank look, I could spot determination? Relief? Or was it because I didn’t want to accept the situation. How could this be happening and why right now?</p><p> </p><p>Anger started to surge up again. The unfairness of the situation also hit me. The utter selfishness of adults, thinking they are capable of deciding for us when they can’t even master their own lives.</p><p> </p><p>“Raphael…” I managed to croak.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, Michelle. He’s fine. He’s up at the house. I kept him home today. I think he’s catching something.”</p><p> </p><p>My head started spinning wildly thinking of my baby brother was up at the house with a violator…</p><p> </p><p>Sylvia must have noticed the fear in my eyes, a fear which would have been unthinkable only twenty four hours before. Why had the world suddenly gone crazy? Why now and why for me?</p><p> </p><p>“The police are up at the house…” Sylvia spoke out again from her corner. She was crouched near the window, her feet up on the seat, with her arms hugging tightly around her knees. She started sobbing uncontrollably, and my mother looked back through the rear-view mirror her face panic stricken.</p><p> </p><p>I wanted to take my sister in my arms, tell her everything would be alright. But I couldn’t. Nothing would be alright from now on. My father had trodden over the boundaries of reason and our lives would never be the same again. The police had invaded our house, it was forever soiled and robbed of its intimacy.</p><p> </p><p>My mother, the woman whom had been by my side day after day, night after night, relentless unbreakable, had finally been shattered.</p><p> </p><p>Her warm kisses had brushed my cheek at bedtime, her soft English voice had narrated of enchanted places and hilarious characters from our favorite English bedtime story books, as we snuggled under the covers on cold winter evenings.</p><p> </p><p>That person whom was my harbor and shelter, was now looking at me through the rear view mirror not daring to turn around, shaken by fear and distress, desperately trying to hold on to her parent role.</p><p> </p><p>I attempted to fire up the courage she urged me to possess, the support she had never found in her husband. She needed me now, but I didn’t want to be a grown up yet, didn’t want to face the real world and its atrocities. But I had to, because I loved the woman she was now, just as much as the mother she had been. She deserved all we could give. We had to help her survive.</p><p> </p><p>“Mum, just tell me what happened, please,” I whispered.</p><p> </p><p>With faltering words she uttered ever so softly, “Michelle. You, Sylvia and Raphael are the most precious treasures I have. Promise me you’ll be strong.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please mum just tell. Why? Why did he do such a thing?” I pleaded her.</p><p> </p><p>“ Sylvia has already told you what happened. He hit me and dragged me on the floor. I got away and ran out of the garage door. Then I suddenly realized that Raphael was still upstairs, so I ran up the side of the house to get in the house from the side door, but your father had already locked me out.”</p><p> </p><p>She started trembling uncontrollably again.</p><p> </p><p>Finally I did what I should have done ages before. I jumped from the back seat into the seat next to my mother’s and took her gently into my arms. She felt so fragile and thin as she whispered in my ear. Yet her warm bitter breath felt so comforting and her touch so tender as she continued with her story.</p><p> </p><p>“He locked me out of my own house. He leaned out of your bedroom window and with a mocking sneer said to me: No one will believe your ranting accusations. There are no witnesses, no one saw a thing. You’re just a hysterical bitch and I gave you what you deserved.”</p><p> </p><p>I could feel the bile rising in my throat. I wanted to be sick. Bastard. He had never been any help to my mother, just a presence in the house, albeit a playful father.</p><p> </p><p>At that very instant I realized that I knew nothing about the kind of husband he was, how he really treated my mother. I was always focused on my own life, my friends and the need for my mother’s constant attention.</p><p> </p><p>All issues were addressed to her. She was the one who took us to our different activities, helped us with our homework, cooked, cleaned. She was our anchor our only reference. Our father was there for us yes, but what did he really do for us, for his wife?</p><p> </p><p>The truth was that although he loved us, he didn’t deserve our esteem or our gratefulness. He had now finally revealed himself to us for what he really was; but why now?</p><p> </p><p>“But mum, why did he hit you, what happened to trigger off all this violence?” I asked trying to understand why he had trespassed over the line of reason.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you know we haven’t been sleeping in the same bed for a while? We are having problems that seriously need to be dealt with. I just couldn’t sleep in the same bed as your father, until these were solved.”</p><p> </p><p>I recognized my complete detachment from their adult lives. I hadn’t cared or wanted to know, although I knew something was wrong. I felt ashamed for not having supported my mother, was shocked at the disturbing psychological traits my father seemed to conceal. He obviously had too much time on his hands and that was somehow damaging his spirit. I didn’t even know what he did for a living, I just realized that too. So basically I knew nothing about my parents.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I had been so lost in my thoughts that I hadn’t heard my mother starting to talk again, catching her in mid sentence.</p><p> </p><p>“… you will come to bed with me tonight, and you will like it. I told him that this wasn’t possible, that things have to be solved before anything else. He just couldn’t accept that as a reason so he hit me…. You know the rest.” She closed off her sentence abruptly. The scene was too vivid and harsh. I could tell she wanted eradicate it forever.</p><p> </p><p>The inevitable senseless act had followed. The reaction of a kid deprived of his toy. Why couldn’t adults behave? They were always telling us what to do, yet here they were destroying my world.</p><p> </p><p>The looming disaster hit me again. What would happen now? Our house, my room, my belongings, my life? I didn’t want to have to give up these objects of security. I felt helplessly vulnerable.</p><p> </p><p>My mother was speaking again. “ I have to defend myself and you children. You realize I can’t stay in our house tonight, I can’t trust your father’s reactions, he has gone too far and he might go further, although I doubt it.”</p><p> </p><p>Cynthia started sobbing. My mother turned round and stroked her soft silky chestnut hair. In a reassuring whisper she said, “You are my life, my precious children, but there is no other option. I will have to find somewhere to go for tonight probably at Anna’s house. You need to be strong. Will you do this for me? I’ll be back tomorrow morning before you wake up.”</p><p> </p><p>Panic lit up Cynthia’s eyes, she started breathing hard. I was strangely detached. This was not really happening. I was dreaming or it was some sick joke my mother had decided to play on me for my sixteenth birthday.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not leaving you, I’m just trying to protect us, please show me how determined you can be when you want to stand up to your mum, in your irritating stubborn way!” my mother said, trying to reassure my sister.</p><p> </p><p>I nearly felt like breaking up into hysterical laughter at her words, feeling relieved that she still hadn’t lost her humor despite the tragic situation we had all been dragged in.</p><p> </p><p>“If you want to come with me you can. But I want to keep you out of this as much as I can. I think if I can keep at a safe distance at night time, then after a few days your father will come to reason. I know he would never touch a hair on your head.”</p><p> </p><p>“Keep us out out of this?” I exclaimed sarcastically. “How can you possibly shelter us from this mum? It’s real, it’s happening whether we like it or not, whether we have chosen it or not. We are stuck with it!”</p><p> </p><p>My mother’s eyes took on such an intense and determined look. They gleamed with fire and love and at the same time with desperation. I looked back into her eyes, pleadingly, wanting her to survive yet not wanting to have to take any decisions, not now not today, maybe tomorrow or next week. That’s when I finally broke down and started crying too.</p><p> </p><p>Here we were in a fogged up boxy green car, three girls desperate to cling on to the comfort of a life and family which was shattering into thousands of pieces. Desperate to reclaim that lost happiness, which was merely an illusion and had no substance at all, like the morning mist over the river and a snow flake in the palm of a hand.</p><p> </p><p>We held each other’s hands, entwined our fingers and looked into each other’s eyes. Three women now, Cynthia and I were no longer girls. Three strong women, yet terrified and vulnerable.</p><p> </p><p>My mother awkwardly took Cynthia in her arms, as she had to twist herself around to reach out for her in the back seat. She suddenly grimaced in pain when my sister wrapped her arms around her.</p><p>“Mum, does it hurt a lot? Where were you injured? Can I see” I said hesitantly. I was grotesquely avid to see the traces of my father’s violence, yet I didn’t want to. I kept having such contrasting feelings, and wasn’t sure which one to listen to.</p><p> </p><p>“What would that help for? I don’t want you to feel sorry for me, I want you to be strong and distance yourself from the situation as much as you can. I can deal with it, I just need time to think, and time to mend. Most of all I need you to continue with your lives and not have to be involved with this, or as little as possible.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mum please just show me,” I asked again.I realized I needed to see, needed proof, maybe then I would fully understand the consequences of the violence and how real the situation was.</p><p> </p><p>My mother pulled up her sweatshirt, she wasn’t wearing a jacket, all she had on was her training gear, she probably hadn’t had time to grab one after the attack. Her back was streaked with red burn marks, as she had been whipped relentlessly, her left shoulder too had a large reddish bruise. She took my hand and gently placed it on her head. My fingers gently touched the left side of her skull, and I could feel a large bump. Although I simply brushed her head she cringed from my touch.</p><p> </p><p>A wave of fear mingled with anger swept over me and my vision was blurred. Here was the reality of violence against a woman who hadn’t accepted to succumb to the desire of her husband, a man who was supposed to cherish and respect his wife. But possession was stronger, regardless if the consequences were humiliating and degrading, the need to possess was stronger.</p><p> </p><p>My mother broke the silence; “ We are now going up to the house, the police are there waiting for us. They are there to protect me and allow me to collect my belongings for the night.They said they can’t do anything else, they can’t force your father to leave his own house. I’ll just sleep at Anna’s house for a few nights, until the heat of this blows away.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know you would want to come, but Cynthia please stay with Michelle, you won’t even notice I have gone. I’ll put you to bed and be there before you wake up, as I always do and have always done.”</p><p>My mother’s expression was imploring us to do as she said. I could tell she too was torn between conflicting feelings. One part of her wanted us to go with her, the other needed us to feel safe and undisrupted. I could sense she was battling against her need for us, as we provided her with the support of our love and her need to be a responsible parent and detach herself from any selfish sentiments.</p><p> </p><p>I felt relieved as well as guilty. I wanted to be with her but I didn’t want to be forced to leave the comfort of my room and house, it felt like a safeguard, albeit an illusionary one.</p><p> </p><p>Deep inside I was jealous of my sister. Sylvia was completely dedicated, one of the most generous spirits I had ever met. Not only was she free hearted, she was also beautiful and intelligent, and most importantly she had no doubts; she would follow our mother to the end of the world. She had the natural candor and discernment I would never have.</p><p> </p><p>However my mother is forever reassuring me that I am beautiful, when I complain about my two year younger sister, with her perfect figure, enchanting green eyes and the most engaging smile I have ever seen.</p><p> </p><p>My mother always marvels at how thick and glossy my hair is. She loves to comb it and takes childish pleasure in reminding me of what curly golden blond locks I had when I was about one. I must say, I am proud of my hair too. Sometimes I feel a bit like Samson one of my Latin teacher’s favorite biblical figures, who often likes to add a bit of of Hebrew or Greek references, saying it adds some color and glamour to her classes.</p><p> </p><p>However, as far as I’m concerned, my hair is my only asset. When I look at the reflection staring back at me in the mirror, I don’t like what I see. Medium height, a bit too healthy looking, which is to say, far from the standard anorexic figures depicted on the fashion mags. And although I can’t say I have been plagued with acne or spots, the latter tend to pop up now and again when I least want them to.</p><p> </p><p>Okay, I admit it, my teeth aren’t that bad. They are pretty straight and a nice bright natural white, especially during the summer when I finally tan a little and my spots disappear at last. So all in all, I’m neither plain nor someone you would pass without a second glance, I am simply another teenage girl hoping to blossom into a slim, attractive and self sufficient woman, and that’s how I see my mother, at least how I had seen her until this day…</p><p> </p><p>My mother slowly turned around to face the windscreen, the outside view completely veiled by the fog on the windows, and took a deep breath. Her jaws were nervously twitching as she ground her teeth in an attempt to regain composure.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s time to go now. Remember, you have no obligation to listen or answer to anyone whatsoever. Do not let others invade your intimacy. Defend yourselves and your space. I will only be gone while you sleep, and tomorrow will bring more insight to the whole affair. I ask you to be strong just for one night.”</p><p> </p><p>With those words she turned the key in the ignition and put the fan up to full throttle to disperse the fog on the glass. She then turned the steering wheel, her hands gripping it so tightly her knuckles turned white and put the car into gear.</p><p> </p><p>We drove past the village square and started the steep climb towards our house, a huge villa nestled on the side of the highest mountain in the area. The people in the square reminded me of unreal paper figurines, as I could hardly see them through the misty windows.</p><p> </p><p>The more we climbed the steep road bordered by the thick pine trees, the more my stomach started to churn. I felt as if I was about to take ten math tests at once and that my whole future depended on them.</p><p> </p><p>I turned slightly towards my sister. She was looking out of the window, with the same determined expression as my mother, her jaw too was working mechanically.</p><p> </p><p>I could just make out the roof of our house, no smoke was trailing from the chimney today. This was the turning point, our lives had changed and nothing and no one could mend our broken wings. Survival was now the only mode.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER TWO - THE TRESPASSERS </strong></p><p>The van parked under the shelter of the weeping willow’s branches stood out blatantly despite the camouflaging canopy. The bare branches drooped over this obscene vehicle, an abstraction trying to impose itself on the peaceful late winter afternoon landscape in the mountains.</p><p> </p><p>The blue letters strewn on the side of the van stood out like glaring neon lights bordering a grey urban street. They jolted me back to reality.“Police”.</p><p> </p><p>My throat felt as if a hand was gripping around my neck and squeezing hard. I could barely breathe. I clutched onto my backpack tightly, as if it was the only security I had left.</p><p> </p><p>My mother parked the car next to the police van and stalled it. She was shaking uncontrollably. She seemed to be losing control once again.</p><p> </p><p>No words of comfort came to me. I suddenly felt I had lost my balance and was falling through an abyss. All I wanted was for this day to end. To erase it from the pages of my diary, where the words to describe it would probably never find their place.</p><p> </p><p>The car was still and the headlights were off, but we remained immobile, as if daring the other to take the first step. I could see the lights on in the lounge, through the double French windows and I even saw the the outline of an unknown figure. One of the policemen no doubt.</p><p> </p><p>I didn’t want to have to affront strangers, people who should have no business in our house at that hour. They made me feel a complete stranger on my own property and I ardently wished them to disappear, desperately hoping they had not entered my room.</p><p> </p><p>The driver’s door finally swung open and my mother stepped out onto the icy grass her feet making a crunching noise as they made contact with the ground. She closed the door softly as if wanting to make her presence as discreet as possible. She then opened the door to Sylvia’s side and took my sister’s hand gently urging her to get out. She then nodding towards me encouraging me with a forced smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Everything will be okay,” she repeated softly,”remember, I’m not abandoning you, keep that foremost in your minds. Tomorrow I’ll be back before dawn. Now let’s go and get this day over with.”</p><p> </p><p>She had spoken exactly the same words that were spinning about in my head. I just wanted to get this day over with. Erase it. Eradicate it, never having to reminisce the sense of loss, emptiness and humiliation.</p><p> </p><p>My sister and I both got out. I slid off the back seat pulling my backpack after me, immediately feeling the cold of the icy ground through my dark purple canvas sneakers as I trod the ground. Frozen fingers brushed my forehead. I looked up into the naked canopy of the weeping willow, wishing it could suddenly fill up with new green leaves and bring life and hope to this desolate winter evening.</p><p> </p><p>We followed my mother in single file, along the lower lawn and up the steps to the terrace, where a large swimming pool took up most of the tiled area. The lights were off and the pool was half empty, with rotting leaves floating on its surface. The pool too had a gloomy and abandoned appearance. I looked up towards French windows on the first floor and now could definitely see the outline of two figures, one obviously my father.</p><p> </p><p>I stood on the last step of the garden steps, not wanting to move. Fear swept over me as I watched my father nodding towards an unknown man, clearly visible in the brightly lit room. He appeared so self assured and even amiable towards the other man. Could he really be a criminal? Capable of hurting his own wife? How well some people concealed their true nature. I couldn’t even trust my own father anymore. So who could I trust?</p><p> </p><p>We climbed up the last flight of steps leading to the front door, which, oddly enough was situated on the side of the house. My mother pushed the door open, as we never locked the front door. Why should we? This was a peaceful village, no one would dare trespass on someone else’s property unless invited to.</p><p> </p><p>Yet one man had. He had trespassed over the limit of respect and had violated a woman’s personal esteem. Funny, I had never noticed this hidden side of my father’s personality, he had always been so charming and amiable. I was still completely off-balance and unable to understand the full extent of the situation.</p><p> </p><p>As we entered the hall, I being the last after my sister, my father popped his head round the corner and smiled radiantly at us and opening his arms in welcome.</p><p> </p><p>“ Michelle, Sylvia don’t worry there has obviously been a simple misunderstanding, and these men have been so nice as to help us clear up all this muddle,” he said in a calm and easy manner, with his air of self importance. The master of the house, the pleasurable host, as always.</p><p> </p><p>For the very first time in my life I realized how my father’s apparent self confidence was in fact plain arrogance. I was shocked by his incongruous grimace and nonchalant words, how he belittled the whole situation, how he blatantly denied it.</p><p> </p><p>A wave of dizziness swept over me as the heat of the room hit us in contrast with the freezing night air. I was in utter confusion, where did the truth lie?</p><p> </p><p>Another two faces appeared in the hall, and the three seemed to merge in a blurred succession, coming together then floating away from each other again. It reminded me of when, as a little girl I looked through a kaleidescope, turning it over and over again to see the pretty coloured geometrical specks converging together to form the most peculiar and fascinating patterns.</p><p> </p><p>However, the patterns forming in the hall of my house were neither pretty nor fascinating, they were grotesque and terrifying and wouldn’t stop this obscene dance</p><p> </p><p>I had left the front door wide open and my father passed by me to close it shutting off the icy draught and the outside obscurity, as if concerned for our comfort. He then turned round and smiled charmingly at me again, then took me into his arms. I just stood there passively in a trance, as he whispered, “ everything will be okay Michelle, this is just a big mistake, I think your mother is close to a breakdown, poor woman, we have to help her.”</p><p> </p><p>What was he saying now? That my mother was insane? How come I wasn’t feeling okay at all, yet everyone kept repeating it was? I felt strangely neutral all of a sudden, all fear had dissipated with the warm reality of our home. This man was my father, not a criminal he seemed perfectly harmless to me. Yet oddly enough he felt like as stranger, I was unconsciously distancing myself from him. Was I unconsciously defending myself from a hidden threat?</p><p> </p><p>He then went up to Sylvia and opened his arms a warm smile playfully trailing on his lips. She stepped back and avoided his arms, pressing against my mother instead.</p><p> </p><p>Was that a look of contempt I perceived? I had in a fraction of a second seen the flash of hatred in his eyes, they had been burning with anger. There was no trace of hurt in them, just cold contempt. Being shunned had obviously hit his ego hard.</p><p> </p><p>His ingratiating manner re-surfaced just as quickly as the look of scorn had. His role was the understanding father and husband who had everything under control. As always a man of integrity and committed to his family.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sylvia has always been his favourite, although he thinks I haven’t guessed. He often compares her to him, proudly stating how similar he and his daughter are with their slim and dark features. He complains about how she is devalued in their measly village and that she could achieve much more. The eldest daughter of course, is criticized for her teenage attitude, average school grades and ‘too well-built’ physique. That’s me of course.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Strangely enough though, today his cherished daughter was shunning him, while I wasn’t. Funny how sometimes things turn out. A part of me wanted to keep him at a distance, yet the other felt that I could not judge someone until he had had his own say in the matter, he should be the one to purge his image. He was now feeling rejected, off balance, yet he managed to keep his composure and put on his wry smile again.</p><p> </p><p>One of the men finally spoke, “Mrs Laurent, you can go ahead and collect whatever you need, but please don’t be too long and make sure you take just your personal belongings.”</p><p> </p><p>“Make sure you take just your personal belongings…” the words echoed in my ears. What did this man think, my mother was a thief or something. I threw him a dark glance and strode right past my father who was still standing there with his affable smile, as if he were at a social gathering, then past the second policeman towards my brother’s room. I needed to feel my baby brother, I craved for his innocence and beaming smile.</p><p> </p><p>I opened the door to his room, at sure enough, there he was playing on his bed with one of his galactic spaceship creations. He looked up as I closed the door behind me and beamed radiantly.</p><p> </p><p>The first sincere smile I had seen since I had left school.I felt a surge of affection for this little man, so strong and intelligent, yet so vulnerable still and oblivious of all that was happening.</p><p> </p><p>“What are those policemen doing her Mickey?” he asked more out of curiosity than apprehension.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, well probably checking up on security measures for the coming winter season,” I replied evasively.</p><p> </p><p>He looked at me with a quizzical expression, then frowned as he added,” are you sure? Whoever heard of such silly security controls, do they think we’re amateurs or something?”</p><p> </p><p>It was hard to fool Raphael, but he let go of the issue as he was obviously not well and feeling tired. His cheeks were flushed and eyes a bit glassy. I sat down next to him and asked him what kind of space craft it was he had conjured up this time. That got him all bubbly and enthusiastic despite his condition and went into a long explanation on the mechanics and missions his new Star-wind Vega II was capable of.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, I could faintly hear my father talking with one of the men as a host of a bed and breakfast would, presenting the assets of the countryside and area. Then I picked up what must have been my mother’s footsteps followed by others, as she walked up the stairs that led to our parent’s bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>She was obviously going upstairs to quickly throw some of her belongings into a bag for the night. I suddenly felt the urge to be near her before she left for the night, so I brushed my brother’s forehead with a kiss, and said, “ stay in bed baby brother, you don’t look that great.”</p><p> </p><p>Raphael glared at me with a disdain, either because he was annoyed that I called him a baby or because he wouldn’t admit he was feeling sick. A moment later, however, he was lying back in his bed unmindful of all that was going on just behind his bedroom door.</p><p> </p><p>I slipped out quietly from his bedroom and into the lounge again. Only one policeman was left, leaning against the fireplace. He stood up straight when he caught sight of me, as if I had caught him in flagrant violation of his duties.</p><p> </p><p>I found a sadistic pleasure in making him feel so obviously guilty and stared on at him for a long while as I walked towards the stairs that led to my parent’s bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>I could hear voices from upstairs. My mother and sister were no doubt upstairs, as the only one left in the lounge area was the policeman, although the only voices I could here were my father’s and the other policeman’s. They seemed to be discussing sports like two pals in a bar.</p><p> </p><p>The whole situation was ludicrous, unreal. These men were acting as if nothing had happened, depriving the event of all importance, stripping it to a bare and flimsy act of female hysteria.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yet, I could feel a feverish energy was in the air, coming from my mother’s and Sylvia’s utter silence, and the frenzied bustling noise, which alerted me that my mother was frantically trying to get as much out of the house as possible, especially her computer in which she meticulously kept all her English lesson sheets and school curriculum she needed for teaching at the village’s primary school.</p><p> </p><p>Finally Sylvia’s trainers appeared through the banister of the staircase, followed by my mother’s trainers, as she was still in her jogging outfit.</p><p> </p><p>“Right,” said the policeman at near the fireplace, who had again recomposed himself as a man of authority. “Have you got all you need Mr Laurent?”</p><p> </p><p>My mother just nodded. I could see that she that she was afraid to talk, lest she should break down in tears. She slowly headed towards Raphael’s door and slipped through into his room.</p><p> </p><p>My stomach was aching badly. I couldn’t breathe or swallow. I just stood there next to Sylvia, who reached out for my hand and took it into hers. It felt strangely warm and reassuring. We didn’t need to look at each other to find the courage we needed to get over this moment of distress. The mere contact of our skin flooded us of warmth and love giving room for hope.</p><p> </p><p>My mother reappeared, her face was a blank and as white as a sheet. Her hair hung limply across her face, which she was trying to hide in order to conceal the tears running down her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>She beckoned us towards her and we followed her into Sylvia’s room, which was next to Raphael’s. Our father took a step towards us. I could see he desperately wanted to keep control of the situation, but the policemen nearest him discreetly stopped him, by putting an arm in front of him stopping him in his tracks.</p><p> </p><p>As I closed the door behind me my mother took us into her arms, squeezing us as tightly as she could, forgetting the pain it was causing her.</p><p> </p><p>“Believe in your mother and hold on tight, this moment will pass and be forgotten, but my love for you will never falter,” the words were so faint I could barely hear them, but they cut deep inside my soul, and Sylvia started sobbing again.</p><p> </p><p>My mother then dropped her arms, opened the door and walked mechanically towards the front entrance, past my father who looked on her nonchalantly, unfaltering from his amiable manner, as if simply witnessing the departure of a guest.</p><p> </p><p>Sylvia and I followed her into the lounge. I still had the echo of my mother’s words ringing in my ears as I watched her hesitantly walk out the door and disappear into the darkness and cold, while my father looked on, his expression a blend of satisfaction, a glimpse of a taunting smile playing on his lips. Could I detect a disquieted flicker in those eyes, or was my mind playing tricks?</p><p> </p><p>I felt as if a hand was gripping at my throat, I desperately wanted to run after her and beg her to stay. My world was going up in smoke and blurring my viewpoint. What was I supposed to do? Should I follow her?</p><p> </p><p>The only certainty I had was that I could not possibly tear myself from my room, my house, my belongings. All I could hope for was that my mother would keep her word, as she had never broken a promise in all my life.</p><p> </p><p>She would be back for us at dawn, to wake me up with a kiss on my forehead, as she had always done since I had come into this world, full of hope and joy.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER THREE - LIES</strong></p><p>The door was still wide open, cold air streaming through. I was holding tightly onto my sister’s arm, trying to restrain her from following through the black abyss. I could feel her pulling away, but I held on, until she finally went all soft like a rag doll, dropped her arm, turned around and returned to her room, locking the door behind her.</p><p> </p><p>The two policemen took leave from my father and followed my mother through into the winter night. My father then closed the door behind them as if to permanently drawing the curtains at the end of a theatre act. Before turning around, he straightened his dressing gown, brushed his fingers through his hair, as if attempting to regain composure, only then did he spin around full of self assurance with a glowing beam on his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Well then,” my father said fully at ease, “if she feels she needs a friend to talk to, fine by me. I can be very understanding, although I do disapprove. Your mother’s place is with her children. She is obviously thinking of herself as always.” Then he added with disdain, “she won’t listen to good advice. Those so-called friends of her are just jealous of her being so lucky with her husband and kids, they are trying to brainwash your mother Michelle,and unfortunately she doesn’t realize they just want her to be unhappy.”</p><p> </p><p>Unhappy? I thought. Anna, my mother’s best friend is the loveliest and kindest person I know, and although my mother doesn’t get much chance to see her friends, it seemed to me that the few she had she had chosen well and were warm hearted and fun to be with.</p><p> </p><p>I felt completely washed out yet those words deeply irritated me and a spark of hostility animated my reply, “ what do you know about her friends, have you ever invited them to come here? Aren’t you happy for mum that they help her so she has less to deal with?”</p><p> </p><p>“Less to deal with? Why, can’t she cope with family tasks just like all the other women, without having to ask for help? We don’t need anyone to help us Michelle, I am the one supposed to be doing that. Why doesn’t she turn to me?” he said with a sour look, similar to that of a child’s when depraved of his favourite toy.</p><p> </p><p>I was now seething with indignation, as I spat out the words I had never before in all my life dared to utter. “Turn to you? For what? You’ve never lifted a damn finger to help your wife. Have you ever driven your kids to school? Ever taken them to music, swimming? Come to think of it, do you know when we finish school on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday…?” I was now just raging on, I was the one to have lost my temper and I was trembling all over, my stomach churning furiously and hurting even more than before.</p><p> </p><p>Incredibly my father just looked taken aback, he didn’t lose his temper. It was as if I had been talking about someone else in the room, to whom though he couldn’t figure out who exactly. He just stared at me with a puzzled expression.</p><p> </p><p>His reaction took me by surprise too. Was he consciously unaware of his own being? He who had always praised his own commitment to his family without realizing that, what he was really worried about was his self image. He wouldn’t trust anyone outside his family sphere.Yet he was fun loving and caring for us, up to a certain point.</p><p> </p><p>Although I had never experienced any outward physical violence, he could be depreciative  towards me and especially my mother. I felt at times he even took pleasure in finding fault in us, as if the more we came short the more he gained in prestige.</p><p>I too found myself standing there staring back at him, the walls seemingly closing in on me as if trying to crush me, a bit like those video games where the hero has to do something to stop the death trap of crushing walls. I had to get out of the room to avoid being crushed by this overwhelming sense of confusion, anger and deep sense of loss.</p><p> </p><p>Turning from my father’s stare, I went to pick up my backpack that was still lying at the base of the stairs and mumbled, “ don’t bother calling me for supper, in case you had envisioned preparing something to eat, coz I am not available as a cook tonight to replace mum.” I then walked in my room that was to the left of the corridor near the front entrance and locked the door finally escaping the harsh reality of the outside world.</p><p> </p><p>The silence in the house was almost eerie. I looked around my cherished room, and found it suddenly very cramped and stuffy, too small and a plain mess really. I had been so pleased last year when my mother had suggested if I wanted to use the old study and transform in into my very own room. I had shared the same room as my sister for an eternity and I was exhilarated to finally have a den of my own. </p><p> </p><p>There was no pleasure left no excitement today, just a dull throbbing in my ears and a sense of sheer emptiness. The familiar objects that were propped up on shelves, hanging from the walls or strewn on the floor, looked incongruous, out of place.</p><p> </p><p>One object in particular definitely stood out as inconsistent. It was propped up against my cluttered desk and looked strangely abandoned and at loss. My mother’s efforts at camouflaging it and wrapping it in bright festive paper had done little to conceal its true identity, as I recognized it the instant my eyes met the object.</p><p> </p><p>My birthday present. I had been anticipating this moment all day,had been thinking of nothing else practically in hope to be able to unwrap this present my mother had hinted at this morning, and now here I was just staring at it with neutral feelings.</p><p> </p><p>All the excitement and anticipation had dissipated. What was I to do with it? I knew what it was now, but there was nobody to thank, nobody to share this immense pleasure with. It was merely another sterile object strewn in my room to add to the mess.</p><p> </p><p>I was taken out of my reverie by a soft knock at the door. Certain that it was Sylvia, I hastily unlocked the door. Facing me was my father, a deep look of concern and sorrow had substituted his self assured poise.</p><p> </p><p>He stepped forward without being invited in and solemnly said, “I need to talk to you about something very delicate Michelle. I hadn’t want you to be involved in this but it seems I really don’t have the choice.”</p><p> </p><p>Dizziness hit me again. What did he want now? I had taken enough for the day. All I wanted to do was to curl up in bed and forget this day had ever existed. As usual, it seemed I had no choice, as always having to yield to adults and their whims.</p><p> </p><p>I took a step back and waved him in with a large sweep of my arm, hoping he would get the sarcasm of my gesture, but he just stepped past me into my sanctuary, that was gradually losing its personality, befouled by the events and invasion of an unwanted presence.</p><p> </p><p>The next thing I knew he actually sat down on my bed. That really got me seething and my heart beat picked up a pace ready for another confrontation. I was about to open my mouth when he buried his face in his hands and started sobbing, in fact it sounded more like he was chocking so for a moment I wasn’t sure what was happening.</p><p> </p><p>I stood motionless looking down on the pathetic scene, ashamed that his distress didn’t stir up any emotion of affection. I was just too numb and irritated. I was feeling too sorry for myself to feel sorry for anyone else today. I blinked impassively and turned my gaze towards the poster over his head.</p><p> </p><p>It was the image of a large guitar decorated with abstract designs and strong colours. In the background musical notes and stars were floating around in space before getting caught into a vortex and sucked in towards the sound hole of the guitar.</p><p> </p><p>Strangely enough the image of the notes trapped in this turmoil and drawn towards their own creator was very pertinent to how I felt. I too was powerless in this cyclone of events, trying desperately to grab on, while being relentlessly dragged into the black hole.</p><p> </p><p>Words floated up from my bed towards the poster, words I could barely make out. “Your mother is having an affair Michelle,” my father’s voice resonated in a raucous whisper. “This has been going on for nearly a year now. She even cooks for him and tidies his place,” he added with an ironic sneer.</p><p> </p><p>I would have no doubt dropped to the floor, if it hadn’t been for the desk I was leaning on. What the hell was he going on about? My mother with another man? I couldn’t believe this, it couldn’t be true. How could she have deceived her family who loved her so passionately? My father must have misunderstood, he was just raving, losing control too.</p><p> </p><p>“I am really worried Michelle,” he continued. Mercifully, his sobbing had stopped, his expression was now one of deep concern.</p><p> </p><p>“Your mother is ill, psychologically ill I mean. She is also physically exhausted. She is taking care of our home and another at the same time, no wonder she reacts so dramatically, throwing accusations indiscriminately. I’m afraid she invented all this ridiculous story. Or worse I fear…” </p><p> </p><p>He didn’t finish his sentence his words trailing ominously. I feared the words that were to follow would announce yet another disaster.I didn’t want to hear them, I wanted to stop him before he spoke them out loud, but he went on relentlessly.</p><p> </p><p>“ Michelle, I think that if she is saying the truth, it was her lover who hit her, which means he is violent and we have to act immediately to help your mother. As her husband I have the responsibility of her well being. I have to put aside my feelings of humiliation and disgrace caused by her unfaithfulness and make sure she gets medical help fast.”</p><p> </p><p>That was when I just let go. This was too much. I had no more references, I didn’t know whom I could trust. Facing me was a man who had been deeply humiliated, yet his integrity was such he wanted to sustain his wife despite her betrayal. I had obviously underestimated him. On the other hand my mother had obvious traces of violence, and I had not doubted her words. </p><p> </p><p>Had my mother had lied to us? She had never done so before, I could put my hand on the fire to her honesty. But maybe my father was right, if she was unstable and psychologically hurt, she wouldn’t be herself.How could we have been so blind? Surely I would have noticed if my mother was seeing another man, and when would she find the time to see him let alone cook and clean for him? This was all absurd.</p><p> </p><p>“Who is this guy anyway?” I spat out, “how can you be so sure? You wouldn’t believe the village gossip, you never even go down to the village dad!”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need to Michelle. I have evidence, concrete proof,” he replied solemnly. “I have hired a private investigator. I did so a few months ago, when I suspected your mother was having an affair. I needed to know!” </p><p> </p><p>He buried his face in his hands again and croaked out the next words, “I know we shouldn’t spy on people, I would never do that, never would have I imagined to sink so low, but I was desperate Michelle, I am still deeply in love with your mother, I just had to know if what I suspected was true!”</p><p> </p><p>I suddenly felt very sorry for this man sitting on my bed. He wasn’t really that charming and self-important man he wanted us to think he was. He was just a despondent soul like I was.</p><p> </p><p>“Who is this guy?” The words slipped out without me realizing. I needed to know who this man was. Who it was she my mother had chosen as a solace from the hardship she obviously was going through with her own husband. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t need to know, and I really think it’s better you keep out of this now Michelle,” he said in an weirdly cold manner.</p><p> </p><p>“Keep out of it?” I nearly shouted out. “How can I keep out of it, you just plunged me right into your relational problems. I now have the right to know who this man is.”</p><p> </p><p>He looked down into his hands as if the name was etched in the palms of his hands, then without looking up he murmured, “it’s your history teacher Michelle, Alain Leroux.”</p><p> </p><p>My ears felt as if they would explode at the sound of that name. Oh please not him, anyone else but not my history teacher. I had an unmeasurable trust in that man, he was the coolest teacher I had ever had. History in his class was like being at a play. He passionately got us involved, so much so that at times we were actually projected in the past, feeling as if we were actually living the battles he portrayed. </p><p> </p><p>My father was peering up at me, eagerly watching my reaction, for just a fraction of a second I wondered if he had just said that to see what effect this revelation would have on me. But no,I was hallucinating, that was reality. No responsible adult would play such an salacious prank, and certainly not to one of his children. Was

<p>            L’air de la pièce lui paru aussi froid qu’à l’extérieure alors qu’elle ne grelotait pas il y a encore une minute dans son débardeur noir. Un vent gelé glissait sur sa peau l’enveloppant de la tête au pied. Elle se tourna pour vérifier que la fenêtre était bien fermée et ne faisait pas courant d’air. Elle poussa sur la poignée pour en être sûr, mais ce n’était pas de là que venait ce vent. Pourtant ses cheveux se mirent à onduler sous l’effet de la brise. Liadan se mit à chercher, en regardant autour d’elle. Mais sa vision se dégradait. Le vent lui faisait tourner la tête, c’était la seule explication. <em>Mais il n’est pas censé y avoir de vent…</em></p>
<p>            Elle devint aveugle. Le monde était encore là : la moquette crissait sous ses pieds et à tatons, elle reconnu le crépis sur le mur. Mais ce n’était que du blanc jusqu’à l’infini. Elle eut beau se frotter les yeux, le blanc laiteux ne voulait pas partir. Puis déferlèrent sur elle les cauchemars, tous à la fois. Les images défilèrent devant ses yeux à une vitesse affolante, mais toutes s’imprimaient sur sa rétine. Un enfant écrasé, un fusillade, un suicidé accroché au plafond, des tripes sur le sol blanc de la cuisine, des yeux qui fixaient le vide, un visage bleu de n’avoir pu reprendre de l’air, les traits gonflés et verdâtres d’un noyé, des corps tordus et empillés, les os qui traversaient la chair. Liadan hoqueta. La panique la faisait manquer d’air.</p>
<p>            <em>Ce n’est que mon imagination, ce n’est pas réel, ce n’est pas réel</em>. La douleur la faisait se faire plier en deux, mais elle ne parvenait pas à savoir quelle blessure la faisait souffrir. Si nombreuses, si brèves, si diffuses. Son cœur s’accélérait. Elle aurait voulu crier, mais aucun son ne pouvait sortir de sa gorge. Elle étouffait. Elle étouffait tellement, sa gorge la faisait tellement souffrir. Elle mis les mains à sa gorge et sentie un tissu contra sa gorge. Il n’était pas là il y a encore un instant.</p>
<p>            Avec ces ongles, elle chercha à le retirer mais elle ne sentait que sa peau. Pourtant le tissu, rugueux et sec, se resserrait toujours plus. Ses poumons la brûlaient. Le froid lui prenait le cœur, elle savait qu’elle n’avait plus qu’à espérer pour la mort. La force de crier lui vint inopinément. Liadan cria comme elle n’avait jamais crier, avec toute la force de son ventre et encore au-delà. Tous ses muscles se tendirent jusqu’à l’extrême tordant son corps. Il n’y avait plus d’air dans son corps, elle savait qu’elle était morte, et pourtant elle criait encore.</p>
<p>            Le retour de l’air dans ses poumons lui fit l’effet d’une vague. C’était aussi douloureux que de ne pas avoir d’air. Liadan s’affaissa sur le mur alors que sa vision revenait doucement. Ses mains se jetèrent sur sa gorge pour retirer ce qui l’étouffait mais elles ne trouvèrent rien. Elle se tira devant le miroir des toilettes. À part les griffures qu’elle s’était elle-même infligée, sa gorge était nue. À trois reprises, elle essaya d’ouvrir le robinet avant d’abandonner. Ses mains tremblaient trop. Dans le miroir, son reflet avait l’air maladif. Ses joues lui parurent un peu plus creusés, ses yeux un peu plus noirs qu’auparavant.</p>
<p>            Liadan se pris la tête en se répétant que ce n’était qu’une crise d’angoisse, certains en faisaient fréquemment, pas la peine d’en faire une montagne. Mais elle était morte, elle le savait. Elle était debout, elle pouvait sentir chacun de ses muscles la faire souffrir. Et elle venait d’expirer son dernier souffle.</p>
<p>            Aucune explication logique ne lui venait à l’esprit. Elle était morte et elle ne l’était pas.</p>

<p>La Tour, la Cour et le Bus.<br/><br/>Elle court dans cet escalier sans fin. Elle les monte depuis toujours. Du moins, c’est l’impression qu’elle a. Elle ne sait même plus depuis combien de temps elle court. Tout ce qu’elle sait, c’est qu’elle doit atteindre le sommet de cette tour. Et qu’elle ne doit pas se retourner. Elle ne les entend pas mais elle sait qu’ils sont là. Juste quelques marches en dessous d’elle. Son pied rate une marche et son ventre se serre d’angoisse à l’idée de tomber. Heureusement, elle réussit à rétablir son équilibre et elle peut continuer sa course.<br/>Elle passe devant une porte en bois massif semblable à toutes les autres. Le décor est minimaliste et affreusement redondant. Depuis qu’elle court dans cette tour, elle ne voit que des marches grises, des murs gris et des portes en bois massif qui constituent la seule touche de couleur de cet endroit. Régulièrement, elle passe devant une meurtrière qui ne laisse voir qu’un ciel couvert d’épais nuages noir zébrés d’éclair. Mais de là où elle est, elle n’entend pas le tonnerre. Elle ne peut que l’imaginer.<br/>Ses jambes fatiguent. Ses poumons sont en feu. Elle n’en peut plus. Elle ralentit mais alors les bruits de courses de ses poursuivants se font plus forts à ses oreilles alors elle accélère à nouveau. Suffisamment pour ne plus entendre les pas de ceux qui la pourchasse. Elle se demande pourquoi elle est là à courir dans cette tour si étroite et manquer de tomber à chaque marche qui se dérobe sous ses pieds. Et puis elle se souvient de la promesse qu’elle leur a faite. Et qu’elle s’est faite aussi. Elle leur a promis qu’elle retrouverait leurs trésors et qu’elle les sauverait. Il n’y a que ça qui les a fait tenir ces derniers temps. Savoir que leurs trésors étaient à l’abri et que bientôt, ils seraient repris de la garde de leurs geôliers. Y penser lui donne un regain d’énergie et sa course se fait plus facile. Pendant un temps seulement.<br/>Elle dépasse une autre porte. Encore. Et encore une autre. Une meurtrière. Encore et encore une autre. N’atteindra-t-elle jamais le sommet ? Elle commence à désespérer et se dit que peut-être vaudrait-il mieux qu’elle abandonne et qu’elle se laisse attraper. Elle sent des doigts frôle sa cheville et son sang se glace d’effroi. Elle donne un coup de pied dans le vide dans l’espoir de cogner son poursuivant. Elle ne sait pas si elle a touché quelque chose, elle n’a rien senti mais elle ne sent plus la présence oppressante collé à ses chevilles. Elle a gagné un sursis.<br/>Finalement, alors qu’elle n’y croit plus, elle débouche sur un palier minuscule. Ca y est ! Elle a atteint le sommet. Elle est contente mais ne laisse pas le temps à sa joie de s’exprimer. Ils sont toujours derrière elle. Elle avise l’armoire en chêne calée contre le mur courbe. Elle n’aurait de toute façon pas pu la manquer. Il n’y a qu’elle qui meuble le palier et elle prend toute la place. Elle s’approche lentement en tremblant soudain effrayée. Et si l’armoire était vide ? Et si les rumeurs qu’elle avait entendue et qui désignait cette armoire au sommet de la grande tour comme le coffre de leurs trésors étaient un piège ? A cette perspective, ses yeux se remplissent de larmes qu’elle tente tant bien que mal de contenir. Elle ne leur fera pas ce plaisir. Elle ne craquera pas maintenant, à quelques centimètres des trésors. De son trésor. D’une main fébrile, elle tourne la petite clé de fer dans la serrure qui sert de poignée et ouvre le premier battant en bois aggloméré.<br/>Un soupir de soulagement s’échappe bruyamment de ses poumons. Elle laisse couler ses larmes qui ne sont plus des larmes de peur mais de joie. Ils sont là. A portée de ses mains. Tous biens rangés, en ligne, par groupe, par couleur et par thèmes. Elle les effleure du bout des doigts et pense aux autres. Elle fait ça pour eux. Mais tout à sa contemplation, elle n’a pas remarqué que les bruits de courses se rapprochaient dangereusement d’elle et c’est un pas plus fort que les autres qui lui rappelle qu’ils en ont après elle. La panique la reprend et elle porte un regard frénétique partout autour d’elle. Il n’y a rien pour emporter tous les trésors. Et elle n’a rien amené avec elle qui pourrait lui servir de sac.<br/>Et les pas qui se rapprochent...<br/>Elle ne sait pas quoi faire. Elle ne le veut pas mais elle se résout à ne sauver que son trésor. Elle le cherche parmi la multitude de petite figurine en plastique qui s’étale devant ses yeux. Elle voit des lions, des schtroumpfs, des pingouins des grenouilles... Et enfin. Enfin ! Elle les voit, les petits crocodiles en tenu de vacances. Le sien, elle le reconnait parfaitement au milieu des autres crocodiles à lunettes rouges. Elle le récupère avec toute la délicatesse qu’elle lui doit et l’enferme dans le cocon protecteur de sa main. Derrière elle, ils l’ont rattrapé.<br/><br/>Alors elle se remet à courir en serrant son trésor au creux de sa main. Les arbres et les bâtiments défilent devant ses yeux. Elle n’y prête pas attention. Elle doit courir, c’est tout. Elle trébuche sur un caillou, sur une racine, sur un défaut du goudron. Elle se reprend toujours au dernier moment dans un grand mouvement de bras et de jambes. Elle perd de précieuses secondes que ces poursuivants mettent à profit pour la rattraper. Elle les sent derrière elle. Elle sent leurs souffles sur sa nuque et ça plus que l’effort de sa course lui fait couler une sueur glacée le long des tempes et dans le dos. Elle a mal aux jambes. Elle a une crampe à la main à force de serrer son trésor. Elle n’arrive plus à respirer. Elle sent qu’elle va s’évanouir alors elle lutte de toute ses forces pour rester concentrer sur sa courses. Elle essaye de ne plus penser à ses jambes, à sa main ou à ses poumons qui la ferait bien hurler de douleur si elle pouvait en prendre le temps. Elle essaye de ne penser qu’à sa course et à son objectif. À cette grille en métal, peinte en vert foncé qui apparait au coin de sa vision périphérique. Elle ne la quitte plus des yeux et sent un gémissement se coincer dans sa gorge en se rendant compte que la grille reste inexorablement à la même place. Elle a beau courir, la grille ne se rapproche pas. Elle reste toujours aussi loin. Et ses poursuivants se rapprochent toujours un peu plus d’elle. Elle a peur. Tellement peur.<br/><br/>La place au milieu de laquelle elle se tient lui rappelle une image des années cinquante. Les maisons ont cette vieille couleur passée des photos en noir et blanc qui ont jaunies. Il fait beau, le ciel est dégagé. Il n’y a que quelques nuages blancs qui bougent lentement. Une légère brise ni chaude ni froide, pas même tiède souffle et fait virevolter la terre. Il n’y a pas de goudron ici. Et il n’y a personne. La place est quasiment déserte. Seul un vieux bus jaune et blanc meuble l’espace.<br/>Une femme aux cheveux bruns mi longs coiffés à la mode des années cinquante grimpe à bord du bus. Elle se rapproche pour mieux détailler cette femme à la robe rouge éclatant qui fait tâche dans ce décor aux couleurs ternes. La femme s’avance dans l’allée du bus et elle la suit des yeux.<br/>Et elle s’arrête, oublie la femme et se pétrifie. Son sang se glace encore. Sa respiration se coupe nette. Son cœur s’arrête. Elle est prise dans un étau d’effroi total. Elle veut fuir mais elle n’arrive pas à bouger. Ses yeux ne peuvent se détacher de l’horrible bébé assis contre la fenêtre sale du bus. Il est énorme, presque difforme. Sa bouche est mangée par ses joues trop grandes même pour un enfant obèse. Ses yeux sont tous petits. Ce sont tout juste deux fentes qui ne la lâche pas et qui la terrorise. Ce montre, elle n’a pas d’autre mot pour qualifier cette chose qui la fixe, a un semblant de chevelure qui ressemble plus à des fils de laine rêche qu’à des cheveux de bébé. Elle ne voit de lui que sa tête et le haut de son torse trop gros même pour un enfant de cinq ans et pourtant c’est bien un nourrisson qu’elle a devant elle. Elle le sait. Au plus profond d’elle-même, elle le sait.<br/>Avec stupeur elle voit les lèvres du monstre s’ouvrir sur une phrase muette. Elle ne l’entend pas et elle distingue difficilement les mouvements de la petite bouche édentée pourtant elle comprend parfaitement et sans hésitation possible ce qu’il lui dit. Parce qu’elle sait qu’il ne s’adresse qu’à elle, qu’il n’a attendu qu’elle pour parler.<br/><br/>- Aide-moi.<br/><br/>Il répète ces deux mots encore et encore et elle ne peut rien faire d’autre que le regarder. Elle veut le fuir. Elle veut mettre le plus de distance possible entre elle et ce monstre mais elle n’y arrive pas. Elle ne peut même pas bouger un doigt, un orteil ou même les paupières. Elle n’a pas cligné des yeux depuis qu’ils se sont posés sur ce bébé.<br/>Elle ne bouge pas plus alors que le bus se met en branle et emporte avec lui le monstrueux nourrisson qui lui demande toujours de l’aider. Elle reste pétrifiée au milieu de la place déserte. Elle ne sait pas combien de temps elle reste ainsi, immobile avec juste le vent qui fait voler ses cheveux longs. Seule. Le cœur au bord des lèvres. Terrorisée.<br/><br/>Une main se pose doucement sur son épaule et elle sursaute en poussant le hurlement qu’elle retient depuis trop longtemps. Sa main s’ouvre et libère la petite figurine de crocodile qui roule à terre. Elle hurle pendant de longues secondes à s’en écorcher les cordes vocales et ce n’est que lorsque son cri meurt dans sa gorge qu’elle cherche à reprendre son souffle. Elle s’effondre. Ses jambes la lâchent et elle tombe lourdement sur ces genoux. Elle se recroqueville sur elle-même dans l’espoir de se protéger. Tant pis si la position ne l’aide pas à retrouver sa respiration. Ses nerfs craquent. Elle pleure. Elle veut que tout ça s’arrête. Elle n’en peut plus. La main revient se poser sur son dos mais elle n’a plus la force de lutter. Tant pis pour ce qu’ils feront d’elle.<br/>Mais la main n’est pas agressive ni menaçante ou autoritaire. Au contraire. Elle est douce et se met à tracer de petits cercles réconfortants le long de sa colonne. Elle entend qu’on lui parle mais ses oreilles sont comme dans du coton. Elle a l’impression d’entendre pour la première fois depuis des lustres. Elle doit faire un effort pour comprendre ce que la voix lui dit. C’est une voix d’homme, basse, grave presque hypnotique. Elle se laisse bercer par cette voix dont elle ne comprend toujours pas les mots mais elle s’en fiche. Pour la première fois depuis longtemps, elle est bien. Elle n’est plus étouffée par la peur.<br/>Peu à peu, elle commence à comprendre ce que l’homme lui dit. Il n’a pas retiré sa main, ni arrêté ses cercles et c’est comme si son monde se limitait à cette zone de son dos. L’homme lui demande de lui décrire un souvenir agréable et sans s’en rendre compte, elle s’exécute d’un ton monocorde. Elle parle, elle se souvient d’une après-midi dans le village de ses grands-parents. Elle est à l’arrêt de bus. Elle attend sous le soleil le bus de 14h. Elle le voit arriver et s’arrêter devant elle. Les portes s’ouvrent et un charmant métis en descend. Il lui lance le plus beau des sourires avant de la prendre dans ses bras et de l’embrasser. C’est son fiancé et il est venu la rejoindre pour les vacances. Elle va le présenter officiellement à sa famille. Ils sont un peu nerveux mais ils oublient bien vite leurs stress en se promenant main dans la main. Ils flânent le long des rues. Elle est heureuse.<br/>Puis c’est le noir.</p>

<p>Mary-Sue courait dans son jardin, son pied gauche s’était posé sur l’asphalte puis son pied droit s’était élancé plus loin en avant, avant qu’il ne se pose lui-même. En une autre longue foulée, elle était sur la route, son cerveau enregistrant un décor dont elle avait l’habitude depuis son premier âge. A la foulée qui suivie, le lotissement familier laissa place à une immensité de blanc cotonneux et de sensation de chaleur apaisée qu’elle n’avait jamais ressenti jusqu’à cet instant. Le changement d’environnement était brutal, pourtant il lui fallut encore deux ou trois foulées pour qu’elle se rende compte que le caniche du voisin qu’elle pourchassait n’était plus devant elle. Elle continua à courir, cependant, plus parce que son corps était passé en pilote automatique que par réel envie ou besoin.<br/><br/>Puis soudain, elle s’arrêta au moment même où elle comprit qu’elle n’était plus dans son lotissement. La question à présent était de savoir où elle était…<br/><br/>C’est alors qu’en levant les yeux par un réflexe venu d’elle ne savait où, son regard tomba sur une pancarte lumineuse – malgré l’absence évidente de néons – claironnant un joyeux « Bienvenue dans l’Au-Delà » en lettres majuscule et clignotante.<br/><br/> - Bienvenue dans l’au-Delà… lut-elle à voix haute comme pour rendre la phrase plus réelle, ou plus compréhensible pour son pauvre cerveau.<br/><br/> De loin, il lui sembla entendre un « Welcome in the Hereafter » prononcé avec autant d’incrédulité qu’elle quelques secondes plus tôt et elle tourna la tête pour voir qui avait bien put parler. Elle constata qu’il s’agissait d’un homme d’une cinquantaine d’année affublé d’une ridicule chemise d’hôpital qui semblait scandalisé de se trouver là. Apparemment, lui savait où ils étaient.<br/><br/> Mary-sue prit le temps de détailler l’homme comme si son esprit cherchait désespérément à éviter certaines questions sur sa propre présence en ce lieu. L’homme donc, portait une chemise d’hôpital laissant outrageusement voir son arrière-train – vision dont se serait bien passé Mary-Sue – et un bracelet lui aussi d’hôpital et c’était à peu près tout. Il n’avait pas l’air plus déstabilisé que ça d’être dans cette tenue puisqu’il n’y prêtait aucune attention trop occupé à engueuler – Mary-Sue n’avait pas d’autre mot pour qualifier le monologue de l’homme – comme un cochon le panneau lumineux. Mary-sue ne comprenait pas grand-chose de ce qu’il disait, d’une part parce qu’il parlait vite et surtout parce qu’il parlait en anglais à un panneau qu’elle, voyait écrit en français. Elle jeta un coup d’œil à trois cent soixante degré autour d’elle pour voir si, par hasard, elle ne trouvait pas planquer quelque part des caméras cachées qui expliqueraient grandement la situation abracadabrantesque dans laquelle elle se trouvait. Elle fut déçue, bien que pas si surprise que ça – de constater qu’il n’y avait aucune caméra cachée – sans doute parce qu’il n’y avait pas vraiment d’endroit où les cacher.<br/><br/> Le lieu où elle se tenait était une large et longue place plus ou moins déserte dont elle ne voyait pas le sol puisqu’il était dissimulé par une brume nuageuse et blanche. Elle ne voyait pas ses propres pieds. Cà et là, des points qui devaient être des êtres humains semblaient tous regarder le grand panneau lumineux en étant tout aussi perdus qu’elle. Certains avaient soudainement l’air de s’être pris un coup de jus et passaient sous le grand panneau toujours aussi lumineux et qui commençait doucement mais surement à gonfler sévèrement Mary-Sue. Il lui paraissait que ce panneau la narguait, comment, pourquoi et en quoi, elle aurait bien était en peine de le dire mais il la narguait, elle l’aurait juré.<br/><br/> Du coin de l’œil, elle vit l’homme anglophone se lasser d’enguirlander le panneau et se résigner en quelque sorte en poussant un soupir à fendre l’âme avant de marcher lui aussi en direction du panneau pour passer en-dessous. C’est alors qu’un détail qui était plus qu’un détail pourtant frappa Mary-Sue du sceau de l’évidence : l’homme – comme toutes les autres silhouettes et elle-même comme elle put le constater après avoir examiné ses mains – était translucide. Non, ce n’était pas le bon mot. Elle ne voyait pas à travers lui – ou elle-même – mais l’homme avait cette apparence superficielle de blancheur transparente comme s’il était délavé ou tout en nuances de gris – ou plutôt de blanc – elle ne savait pas vraiment quelle image choisir. Il y avait également une impression de consistance vaporeuse qui se dégageait des êtres qui l’entouraient et qui, étrangement, la mettait mal à l’aise. Certainement parce que ce « détail » cumulés à tous les autres – et surtout au message du panneau, il fallait quand même bien l’admettre – la mettait sur la voie du lieu où elle avait débarqué sans qu’elle ne sache comment : l’Au-Delà.<br/><br/> - Oh ! Mon Dieu ! Je suis morte ! S’exclama-t-elle comme l’évidence de sa mortalité effective la traversait de part en part.<br/><br/> Quelque part sur l’esplanade, quelqu’un de visiblement francophone claqua un « bravo Captain Obvious » qu’il accompagna d’applaudissement. </p>

<p>Ces lèvres étaient inouïes. Je ne les avais encore jamais goûtées, à mon grand regret, mais elles devinrent vite mon obsession. Lorsque je les observais s’agiter pour nous raconter une histoire fantasque, je revivais. Lorsque je les sentais se mouvoir fermement pour nous indiquer la marche à suivre, je me redressais. Lorsque je les entendais susurrer une parole douce, je les cherchais.  Lorsque je les imaginais s’approcher au creux de mon cou, je frémissais. Et pourtant, elles étaient distantes, ces lèvres. Inouïes, exquises, sublimes, mais distantes. Seule ma joue avait eu l’immense plaisir de les sentir pleinement. Un baiser d’adieu un soir de juin, franc et ferme, tendre mais froid, qui eut effet quelques jours plus tard.</p>

<p>Dans l’aube timide, les bâtiments silencieux de la ville dressaient fièrement leur toiture face au ciel. Plus la lumière augmentait, plus l’ombre d’un immeuble libérait son voisin. Vraisemblablement, c’était l’été. Fin avril, peut-être mi-juin. L’air frais du matin faisait perler les feuillages, et s’annonçait comme la dernière oasis avant le désert de la journée. Cette ambiance estivale, pourtant des plus optimistes, n’arrivait pourtant plus à réchauffer le cœur des habitants de la ville. Car si elle avait été épargnée par les bombes, le virus, lui, l’avait bien infiltré. <br/><br/>Accroupie derrière le mur, Siobhan inspectait les environs. Le jour naissant était traître, les premiers rayons avaient tendance à chasser les terreurs nocturnes et faire sortir les survivants apeurés de leur cachette. Beaucoup étaient morts ainsi.<br/>Actuellement, les seuls bruits audibles provenaient du paysage. Des sacs plastiques en liberté, des feuilles mortes rasant les murs, une canette ivre morte dont le cadavre roulait sur la voix encombrée. Pas un bruit. Et pourtant, Siobhan savait qu’ils n’étaient pas loin. Il y en avait toujours. Peu importe le nombre qui tombait dans les pièges qu’elle et son père avaient tendus çà et là, il y en avait toujours. <br/><br/>Il allait lui falloir attendre patiemment pendant encore une ou deux heures. Il lui fallait une visibilité parfaite, maintenant que le jour se levait. Sinon, il lui en coûterait la vie. Ou pire, si elle n’avait pas de chance. A l’abri dans sa cachette, elle s’installa plus confortablement. Si tant est que le carrelage froid d’un hall d’immeuble pouvait être confortable. Avec des gestes lents pour être silencieux, elle sortit d’une poche, une montre à gousset. Bientôt six heures du matin. L’été approchait, à grands pas, le soleil allait bientôt pointer le bout de son nez. Dans quelques jours, ils pourraient tous enlever leurs vêtements chauds si encombrants. Dans quelques jours, ils commenceraient à exposer un peu plus leur corps au danger. Elle soupira doucement. Depuis quand la vie était-elle devenue si laborieuse ?<br/></p>

<p>Brodant sur les bribes d’informations qu’elle avait pu glaner par-ci par-là sur Alexei Popova, remplissant les vides de son imagination, elle brossa le portrait d’une femme forte et indépendante, une féministe avant l’heure. Elle lui inventa une enfance rude, courageusement affrontée avec le caractère d’une vraie battante. Des déboires sentimentaux à la lutte pour l’autonomie financière, elle para son modèle de toute la force qu’elle aurait voulu posséder elle-même, fit tout pour la rendre admirable aux yeux de son auditoire. Puis, lorsqu’elle en vint à la carrière de tueuse de Madame Popova, elle prit soin d’insister au préalable sur la condition des femmes dans la Russie rurale de la fin du XIXᵉ, supposant l’ignorance de Lou et Sophie en la matière. Quand enfin elle arriva au tableau de chasse invraisemblable, Lou la coupa.</p>
<p>— Trois cents mecs ? Tu te fous de ma gueule ? C’est une légende urbaine à la con, ça, rien d’autre !</p>
<p>Dinah se mordit la langue : quitte à inventer autant pour le reste, elle aurait dû tricher sur le nombre de victimes revendiquées pour éviter cette incrédulité prévisible. Un rattrapage aux branches s’imposait.</p>
<p>— D’accord, elle s’est peut-être vantée sur ce coup-là. Mais à sa place tu en aurais sûrement fait autant, non ?</p>
<p>— Et tu voudrais prendre ça comme modèle pour faire… Faire quoi, au juste ? Tu vas monter une asso secrète ? « Élimination discrète à prix raisonnable » ? C’est ça, le plan ?</p>
<p>— Tu vois une autre façon de libérer toutes ces femmes de ces salauds ?</p>
<p>Lou siffla entre ses dents.</p>
<p>— « Libérer » ? Rien que ça ! L’asso des femmes « libérées », ça pète !</p>
<p>— C’est bien de ça qu’il s’agit ! Popova l’a dit elle-même : elle <em>libérait</em> les femmes qui lui demandaient de l’aide. Et on parle de bien plus que d’une association, là, ce sera un…</p>
<p>Quelle était cette expression trouvée sur le Net qui l’avait frappée de façon si mémorable ? <em>Husband killing…</em></p>
<p>— Syndicat ! Voilà ! Un syndicat de libération des femmes. Un comité d’action politique, en somme. Mais une action radicale, qui ne s’embarrassera plus des rouages du système.</p>
<p>Lou secoua la tête et se vautra dans le canapé en signe de reddition.</p>
<p>— T’auras l’air maligne avec tes beaux discours quand tu seras en taule.</p>
<p>— L’idée est bien évidemment de ne <em>pas</em> se faire prendre.</p>
<p>— Comme ta bonne femme russe ?</p>
<p>Dinah hésita l’espace d’un instant. Fallait-il mentir sur ce point ? Avouer que Madame Popova avait été dénoncée par l’une de ses commanditaires, arrêtée, exécutée, est-ce que ça ne détruirait pas le peu d’intérêt qu’elle avait réussi à susciter ?</p>
<p>— Si elle ne s’est pas fait prendre, comment est-ce qu’on connaît son histoire, mmh ? continua Lou avec un rictus.</p>
<p>Touché. La petite dure avait décidément l’esprit affûté. Dinah se félicita de ne pas avoir essayé de la tromper davantage : rien de moins crédible qu’un imposteur qui se fait prendre une fois.</p>
<p>— Oui, bien vu. Elle s’est effectivement fait arrêter. Mais ça ne nous arrivera pas à nous : nous serons mieux organisées et surtout plus prudentes.</p>
<p><em>Et personne ne nous dénoncera, les femmes que nous sauverons nous seront trop reconnaissantes pour ça.</em> Elle garda sagement ce dernier argument pour elle, sachant que Lou le balayerait plus vite que le reste.</p>
<p>— Ben voyons…</p>
<p>Le silence s’imposa sur ces belles paroles. Elles restèrent toutes les trois blotties dans le calme revenu, chacune méditant la conversation sans oser regarder les autres en face. Même Lou avait l’air mal à l’aise. Quelque chose s’était cassé en elle depuis le départ d’Eva, comme si cette dernière, en fuyant, avait entraîné dans son sillage des bribes de son amie, aujourd’hui plus perdue que jamais. Son assurance avait fait ses bagages en premier, puis s’en allèrent sa combativité et ses certitudes. Et sa crête de punkette avait suivi. À l’étroit sous ses cheveux filasse et raisonnablement coupés, l’ombre de Lou tentait d’exister, mais sans grande conviction. Dinah se demanda si elle n’avait pas placé ses espoirs au mauvais endroit.</p>
<p>— Dinah…</p>
<p>La main de Sophie sur la sienne la sortit de ses rêveries.</p>
<p>— Je suis fatiguée, j’aimerais me reposer, se plaignit la quasi-convalescente.</p>
<p>Lou comprit ce que ça signifiait et parut soulagée.</p>
<p>— J’allais partir, de toute façon.</p>
<p>Elle se leva sans cérémonie et s’apprêtait à partir sans prendre congé. En cela au moins elle n’avait pas changé.</p>
<p>— Lou… tenta Dinah une dernière fois.</p>
<p>Un œil morne et ennuyé la supplia silencieusement de ne pas insister.</p>
<p>— S’il te plaît… Penses-y.</p>
<p>Les deux filles se jaugèrent un instant qui leur sembla durer une heure, puis Lou soupira.</p>
<p>— Ok.</p>
<p>— Merci. Je te demande juste d’y réfléchir à tête reposée.</p>
<p>— C’est tout réfléchi, quichonne.</p>
<p>Elle attrapa sa veste et se retourna devant l’entrée.</p>
<p>— J’en suis. Je sais déjà ce que ça donnerait si je « réfléchissais ».</p>
<p>Et la porte se referma, laissant sur place une Dinah stupéfaite.</p>

<p>La plainte qu’elle avait déposée après avoir rassemblé son courage et ravalé son mépris de la justice lui avait tout de même acheté un répit, même si la police n’était pas venue comme elle l’espérait. Le médiateur avait eu une discussion animée avec Hugo, en aparté, et ce fut tout. Personne ne l’arrêta, lui, et personne ne l’emmena, elle.<br/>Et cette nuit était arrivée. Le vieux salaud ne craignait peut-être plus d’avoir d’ennuis, ou alors il était juste incapable de se retenir, comme n’importe quel cas social déviant. Cette fois, elle l’attendait, ivre de rage. Elle lui assènerait d’abord un coup de pied au bas-ventre, puis jetterait sa couette sur sa grosse carcasse avant de le tabasser à coups de lampe de chevet. Encore un pas et c’était un homme mort.<br/>— Lou…<br/>La jeune fille tressaillit : la voix n’était qu’à quelques centimètres de son oreille, elle avait mal calculé son coup. Bondissant comme un diable, elle renversa de son édredon un corps et s’effara du bruit mat que renvoya le parquet. Dans la lutte, elle roula à la renverse à deux pas de la porte et glapit lorsqu’elle se sentit saisie par la cheville. Ruant de plus belle, elle se dégagea avant de foncer dans le couloir faiblement éclairé. Arrivée au sommet de l’escalier, une main lui agrippa l’épaule et la fit pivoter brutalement. Trop brutalement pour son pied qui manqua la première marche. Une vocifération furieuse fit résonner son nom à ses oreilles pendant un vol plané qui dura une éternité, suspendu à son espoir de massacre.<br/>— Lou !?<br/>Elle atterrit sur Eva. Éberluée, Lou fixa stupidement le visage effrayé de son amie avant que ses yeux ne s’habituent à la pénombre. Le salon marseillais, vidé de ses invités, était aussi mal éclairé que le couloir de la maison de Montrouge qu’elle avait fuie. À la surprise d’Eva, sa copine se mit à rire.<br/>— Putain, Lou…<br/>Se dégageant, les deux filles reprirent leur place sur le matelas.<br/>— Déconne pas. Éric et Caro sont pas obligés de nous héberger, alors fais moins de bruit, ils dorment dans leur chambre, là.<br/>Après avoir retiré son jeans et son sweat, Lou chercha du regard son blouson, qu’Eva finit par lui tendre, devinant ce qu’elle y cherchait. Le paquet de cigarettes et le briquet extraits de la poche intérieure, les deux filles s’en grillèrent une à deux. Lou pouffait toujours, plus bas cette fois, mais l’autre ne l’interrogea pas tout de suite, comme à leur habitude.<br/>— Tu sais ce qui est le plus drôle, Eva ?<br/>La lueur d’un lampadaire au-dehors brillait juste assez pour faire ressortir les dents parfaites de la jeune amazone hilare.<br/>— Je ne l’ai même pas fait exprès. Ce trou du cul est tombé dans l’escalier.</p>

<p>Stefan Novick’s silver-tipped pen tapped a relentless tattoo against the surface of his desk. He glowered down at it, as if the device moved under some force other than his own hand. Guarin Bohne watched with growing unease, trying not to squirm in his hard wooden chair. The last thing he wanted was to call attention to himself. He sat, and sweated, and refused to stir, even when a lone fly buzzed and perched on his hand, crawling up his wrist as if aware that he could do nothing to stop it right that moment.</p><p>The pen stilled, plunging the room into silence. The four other people assembled there took a quiet, collective breath, then held it. The glowering blue eyes raised, then settled upon their chosen target. Waves of relief, then shame, flooded through Guarin, though he dared not show it. The woman sitting next to him, upon whom Novick was now intently focused, shrank under the withering glare.</p><p>“Explain again what happened.” The quiet voice was tinged with poison. The undercurrent in the room was clear, despite the words: Explanations were not needed. Not anymore. Now, punishment must be exacted.</p><p>In spite of this clear message, the explanation tumbled out again. Feminism be damned, Guarin still hated when it was a woman. This one - Andrea, that was her name - was managing as much dignity as possible under the circumstances. But he had seen both men and women under the power of that gaze, some of them the bravest souls he knew. It was a wonder she was able to form coherent sentences.</p><p>The story was the same as it had been in the first two tellings: the caravan had been right on track. Ahead of schedule, even. The food supplies that the city desperately needed had only been a day’s drive away from the gates, and the harvest had been highly successful.</p><p>Unfortunately, the crew had not been the only ones to notice that.</p><p>The refugees were many steps ahead. The scouts found no trace of them and had given the caravan the all clear to proceed. Then, all hell broke loose.</p><p>“I still fail to see, dear Andrea,” Novick’s voice purred, “how your crew of more than a hundred trained men and women was caught completely off-guard by a ragtag band of miscreants.”</p><p>Andrea opened her mouth, then closed it again. Rationally, she knew the frivolity of offering an explanation. Her head bowed and her eyes slid closed, a single tear forming.</p><p>“They were on their home territory.”</p><p>Guarin’s heart dropped as the words exploded into the silence. It dropped even further as he recognized the voice that spoke them. His own.</p><p>Those steely blue eyes shifted, and now it was Guarin’s turn to sweat. He did his best to maintain composure, though. To meet that gaze. The die were cast, and he had no choice but to plow ahead.</p><p>“The woods are where they live,” Guarin continued, ignoring the shock on his fellow council members’ faces. “It was natural for them to have an advantage. They know how to conceal themselves, where to watch the road, what approaches are best for overtaking a caravan, even a well-armed one.”</p><p>As he spoke, a wild, desperate idea started to form in his head. Novick had not cut him off yet, so he continued, his voice gaining strength. “We need to take a different tactical approach. Perhaps, if we had their knowledge of the forest, some insight into how they work…”</p><p>He trailed off, then, realizing the audacity of what he was proposing. Novick’s face was an expressionless mask. Guarin felt a hard knot of ice form in his belly.</p><p>“Guarin Bohne,” Novick pronounced slowly, turning his silver-tipped pen over in his hands, gazing at it as if it were the most fascinating object in the world. “Are you proposing that we spy? On the refugees?”</p><p>There was no denying it, so Guarin simply nodded, keeping his lips pressed tightly together. He wondered what his punishment would be for speaking up this time. Confinement? The stocks? Or something worse? He tried to suppress a shudder. How had it come to this?</p><p>The silence stretched out as Novick contemplated the idea. Guarin felt the faintest hint of incredulity, then outright shock as a faint grin twitched behind the man’s well-groomed beard. </p><p>“I like it,” Novick announced. The surprise in the room was almost palpable. Andrea’s eyes bugged out of her head. Guarin felt a surge of hope.</p><p>The silver pen pointed right at Andrea’s face, though, swift as a blade, and Guarin quickly reined in his emotions. “I want likely candidates chosen by the end of the week.” Novick’s eyes flicked to Guarin, then went back to Andrea, whose features were glowing with fierce determination. She nodded her head vigorously, blond hair coming loose of its efficient bun to fall around her shoulders. </p><p>“Yes. Right away, sir,” she murmured, her voice hoarse. She shot a glance at Guarin from the corner of her eye, filled with such gratitude that he almost laughed aloud. Perhaps they had escaped, this time.</p><p>With that, they were unceremoniously dismissed. Novick turned away, back to the pile of papers on his desk, and gave a faint flick of his wrist. His council silently gathered themselves and shuffled out of the door.</p><p>Still disbelieving, Guarin risked a look over his shoulder at where Novick sat, straight-backed and proud. His eyes met steely blue once more, and a chill crept up his spine. Novick’s gaze, still filled with smoldering anger, was fixated on the back of Andrea’s head.</p>

<p>They arrived at the town hall and entered. The reading was just beginning, and they sat near the back of the hall as quietly as they could. The mayor himself was doing the reading tonight, though he was focused on the children around him and didn’t seem to notice Mary or Emmilyn.</p><p>""Are you ready?” asked Mayor John.</p><p>“Yes!” came the excited answer from the children.</p><p>Mayor John opened the book in his lap and began to read.</p><p>“What follows is the history of our world, as passed down to me from my father, and from his father before him. It explains everything about the way our world is, for better or for worse, though still many do not believe it to be true.” He stopped reading and looked up at the children. “Do you believe?”</p><p>“Yes!” came the enthusiastic answer. Emmilyn nearly answered with them.</p><p>The mayor continued reading, “Yet in spite of this, I feel I must record the legend here for my own children to share with future generations.” Emmilyn found herself mouthing the words as John read them. She still nearly had it memorized, even after all these years.</p><p>“Long ago,” John read, “before the age of men, the elder dragons ruled the land. They warred constantly, and the world burned before them, for they were immortal, and their fight would last an eternity and destroy all things. Yet something awakened within the planet, one last gasp to keep it from dying out. From this desperation came the Wild, the perfect mix of nature and magic. The Wild fought back, banishing the dragons to the eight corners of the world.</p><p>“There they remain to this day, contained but not dormant, unable to stop the rise of man but still able to affect every day of his life.</p><p>“To the south was sent Thraxis, the great red dragon of fire. To this day he breathes flame, scorching the land around him, bringing the warm air of summer.</p><p>“To the north was sent Lyria, the gray dragon of ice. When she stirs, even Thraxis gives way to the power of winter.</p><p>“To the west was sent Zephrox, the white dragon of air and wind. Her breath commands Thraxis and Lyria to obey, strips the leaves from the trees in autumn, and ushers in great change.</p><p>“To the east was sent Galespo, the charcoal dragon of storms. Thunder is the sound of his voice, and lightning rends the sky at his rage. The wrath of Zephrox is brought upon all of us when she clashes with Galespo, even from opposite ends of the world.</p><p>“To the northwest was sent Chronos, the pale blue dragon of time. Her whisper is constant, affecting all we do, yet never felt nor seen.</p><p>“To the southeast was sent Nethratal, the great black dragon of death, the largest of all the dragons. His kingdom is a swamp, and the only things to walk there are those who have already died. His power alone overrules all the others, including the time streams of Chronos.</p><p>“To the southwest was sent Pathos, the green dragon, the brother of Nethratal. Some say he already met his end at Nethratal’s hand; yet he still walks, an unwilling servant of his evil brother, forever spreading plague and disease to add to his brother’s kingdom.</p><p>“And finally, to the northeast was sent Syllith, the blood dragon of deep crimson. In her is the power of life, yet she would choose to shed blood, rending flesh with her claws and teeth, to usher in disease and death.</p><p>“Thus were banished the eight elder dragons, from whom all other dragons were born, a last remnant of their legacy, a dying gasp of magic from before the age of man. There they remain to this day, waiting for the fall of the Wild and their return to power.”</p>

<p>""Guinavere look at me and tell me how you think you can continue on like this?""<br/><br/>	Biting her tongue, the urge to smack him was there.  The itch was in her palm just to hurt him physically the way he was hurting her emotionally.  Yet the contact in anger risked seeing a memory or thought that shared the same amount of emotion.  She did not want to see the future that waited for him.  He was clueless to what it was and was blessed enough to not have to live with those images day after day.  Sleep was supposed to be an escape from this crap world she was forced to live in.  Yet in her dreams she was forced to see her visions over and over again.  If not the nightmare experiences from her childhood, then it was what would happen to Zani and his family.  Worse was the more time went on the worse they got.  There was no getting sleep after this.  To be haunted by choices she had yet to make was the worst feeling in the world.<br/><br/>	Feeling him grab her chin with a soft gentle touch, she did all she could not to cringe at the contact.  This was just not fair.  Turning her head away, surprised that he would let her go, the fight to keep the tears from falling was one she was starting to lose, ""What do you want me to tell you?  You getting some sick satisfaction from me answering you?  I don't know.  Honestly I have no idea how much longer I can go on like this.  I don't.  All I know for sure is that the longer you stay here the shorter amount of time I have.""<br/><br/>	Moving away from him, she did her best to curl herself up in a corner of her bed before continuing, ""You think they don't know you're here?  You're outside of the boundary line.  You're far from where you live and have spent the better part of your life since you came to this country.  You have ruined everything by being here.""<br/><br/>	Hiding her face in the blanket, she needed to be alone so bad.  Still able to feel his touch, it burned at her skin.  Any doubt she had ever had about how much he was able to keep below the surface was now confirmed.  He had no idea just how angry he was when he appeared to be calm on the surface.  The memory that was pulled thanks to his inability to censor memories was nonexistent.  He did not understand why she hated to be touched.  How much pain it could cause.<br/><br/>	As his memory seared itself into her mind, she felt as if she were going to be sick.  Leaping from the bed, she ran to the bathroom and threw up what little she had managed to eat the day before.  How could he live with that memory in the front of all other thoughts?  <br/><br/>	Feeling as if she were melting into the floor, the only thing she could do was weep for what she had been forced to witness.  A dead little girl that had meant something to him.  She had no idea who it was.  All she could feel was the sadness, anger as well, but sadness had nearly closed off her throat.  Her whole chest ached.  Why did the world have to do that to those that did not deserve it?<br/><br/>	A brush of fingers against her shoulders, she smacked his hand away, ""Get out of here.  I hate you.  You understand hate?  You're a violent man that believes it's okay to use such things because you're leader of your family and yet you hate the idea of that.  You do it out of guilt.  Guilt because of the little girl you found dead and knew you had to go confront her family.""</p>

<p>He had to figure out how to erase himself from her memories.  Perhaps not be so careful.  No human had ever been able to remember when he did not wish it.  He had lived nearly six centuries and it had never happened once.  Well it had only one other time.  That had been with Rose and now this Katrya girl.  Why had she come here anyway?  What did she want?  <br/><br/>	Looking at the shelves he found nothing.  The darn thing had been there three nights ago.  He knew he should have taken the darn thing.  Just removed the pictures of himself and Rose and left the rest.  He had no desire to have pictures of Rose's late husband nor her children.  He saw too much of that other man in them to be able to see Rose.  None of them held that smile.  Had that same color of golden brown that had been Rose's alone.  How could none of that had passed on into the several generations he had watched grow up?<br/><br/>	This Katrya had none of the qualities that had attracted him to Rose.  She was a little chubby, had bright golden blond hair, and dark blue eyes similar to his own.  Not to mention she was a bit on the short side and he did not like short women in any form.  That hair color was enough to turn him off.  That was the mark of the other clan.  He had no desire to find out if she had clan blood in her system.  What was the point?  Bring another stupid human into a fight that could never be won?  Yeah right.  Keegan had enough on his mind than to take another in.<br/><br/>	“What are you looking for?  Some things were moved around in case she had visitors.” the girl asked.  Damn thing was still here in his business?<br/><br/>	“A box.  A wooden box that has celtic knot work carved into the sides and top.  Has a metal lock to keep it shut.  Rose always kept it on the top shelf in the closet so she would know where it was.  No one ever touched it unless she asked to look at it.  No one should have touched it.” he snapped at Katrya.  Dumb thing really was trying to get a death wish.  If she had touched it.  He could not stand people touching Rose's things right now.  Even her own family was at risk from his wrath.  He needed those pictures.  Needed a way to keep those memories from fading into nothing like so many others had.<br/><br/>	“Her granddaughter had that box set out at the wake and funeral.  There were a lot of things in the box that they had set out as a way of having a memory box for others to see and add to.” Katrya explained folding her arms over her chest.<br/><br/>	Counting to five in his mind, Drudwyn had to calm himself.  The idea that so many people had not only seen the box, but had perhaps touched it and went through the pictures.  Why the hell did everything have to blow up in his face like this?  Why could that box have just stayed put where it had always been?  Why did her family have to touch and move everything?  Did they have no respect for where Rose had put anything?  Slamming his fist on the wall, he had to go get that box back.  <br/><br/>	“Why not watch that attitude you're having right now?” Katrya spoke, her voice hinting on annoyance.  He could show her just how annoyed he was with her.  She could never understand what this meant to him.  Why this was so important.  No human was ever going to be able to understand what Rose had meant to him.  How close he had been to forcing her choice just so he could spend more time with her.  How hard it had been to watch her marry some other guy and have children with him.  No one was ever going to understand.<br/><br/>	Removing himself from the room, he knew he had to get the box.  Had to get the pictures out before all of his work was undone.  It took a lot of energy to erase decades of memories from multiple humans.  Especially her eldest son.  He had the most memories.  His mind had been built to remember things down to such fine details it was a wonder that he had never became a detective.<br/><br/>	“Drew!” <br/><br/>	He had to ignore her voice.

<p>Scowling at the so-called man that held a dagger to the side of her neck, this was not what she had wanted. Death would be merciful at this point. Her right leg throbbed with sharp pain. No doubt that last fall had been hard enough to break the bone. Great. There would be no mercy this time around. Not after escaping again. At least this time she had gotten outside for a breath of fresh air for the first time in well over a decade.<br/><br/>""Thought you could get away, Myrna?"" the man asked tugging on her short dark chocolate hair.<br/><br/>He had no desire to hear any sort of reply except perhaps a yelp of pain. He deserved no such reaction. His anger was not all towards her. So much for top security and her cell being locked and the doors needing a card to go in or out. Every bit of security had been thrawted. Not like it was hard after the same boring routine for the last ten years. The same guards, the same doctors, the same scientists. Almost as if time had stopped moving forward within her prison. At least she still had time. Others had not been so lucky.<br/><br/>""Answer me!""<br/><br/>Wincing feeling his fingers pull even harder at the short strands, if only she was facing him. That would be an ametur mistake for him to make, one he had not made in over eight years. In her dreams she had killed him over and over and had been able to go back to a life. Shame sleep was something she got so little of, but the moments she could it was definatly a wonderful pleasure.<br/><br/>Feeling the blade push into her skin, she kept her jaw tight, her eyes straight forward on the wall. If he got pissed enough he would just end things and that be fine with her. That was what made him such a horrible captor. While able to instill fear into detainees, his anger could quickly cloud over his judgement. There were clear scars from the last time he had lost his temper.<br/><br/>""You would rather die than answer?"" he whispered in her ear so close she could feel the moist heat of his mouth against her skin. It was just disgusting.<br/><br/>Having no time to brace herself before the fall, Myrna punched the concrete floor uncaring of how much pain was in her hand. It was nothing compared to what was in her leg. Something was definatly not in place somewhere. Nothing else would cause so much pain. Yet she held back the tears and kept her mouth shut to avoid making any sound that would allow Arvel to claim victory. Pushing herself up to a sitting position, the scared girl still inside wanted to cry out and ask for help, but the hardened woman would not allow it. Looking up, she hated that he was moving to stand behind her.<br/><br/>The only time she had lost her temper with him was something she truly wished she could take back. In those brief moments wanting justice, she had unleashed the true depth of her powers and now anyone that had physical contact was warned of what could happen if she looked at them beyond a few seconds. During any and all experiments that would require her to stay in a lying position, she was blindfolded in an attempt to throw her gifts off. Her hyper sensitivity to any living body with a pulse she could take it down within moments. That was for her to know and them to find out one day before she strangled the life out of them.</p>

<p><strong>Life under the dome</strong></p>
<p>For the past 200 years Chicago has been encased in a dome, protecting it from the outside world.  Beyond the curved, steel wall lies a wasteland; a stew of nuclear fallout, weaponized viruses and bacteria, and feral packs of animals and survivors.  Inside, life is experienced through the wonders of digital networking.  The town is a constant buzz of 24-hour news, video chats, and ever-circling drones. </p>
<p><strong>Life under a watchful eye.</strong></p>
<p>Jane is depressed.  Considered an outsider, Jane has cut herself off from the digital life, craving true human interaction.  This has cost her friends, family, and anything resembling a relationship.  Spiraling into a deep depression, the constant noise and activity slowly begins to drive her to the very edge of reason.</p>
<p><strong>Life, or something like it.</strong></p>
<p>Jane hears a rumor, a story, a myth, really.  A group of survivors, far beyond the reach of the Dome.  A group that is not dependent on technology to communicate.  A group that lives somewhere where the nights are quiet and the stars still shine at night.  A group known as the Quiet Ones.  But attempting to leave the Dome is illegal, a violation that would change Jane from an outsider to a criminal, someone, certainly, that would be judged insane.  Not to mention the deadly wasteland outside, the fact that she doesn’t know where these Quiet Ones might be, and she’s pretty sure she may have just killed her neighbor and her neighbor’s yappy little dog.</p>
<p>On the other hand, anything would be better than going through life as</p>

<p>Benedictine Monastery of Podlažice, Bohemia<br/>July 25 ,1227, 1 p.m.<br/><br/>	The two robed monks roughly dragged Brother Herman through the halls of the monastery, each with a hand gripping his upper arms.  They moved swiftly, Herman's feet scuffing against the worn cobbles as the monks pulled him along.  Early afternoon light slanted through the windows, casting him into alternating bands of light and shadow.  Herman's eyes remained closed, his lips moving in silent prayer.  The two monks shouldered their way into an inner chamber, unceremoniously dumping Harold to the floor.  The breath left his body as he landed and he was slow rising to his knees.<br/>	Herman straightened, opening his eyes.  His gaze took in the room, a small chamber, the walls lined with shelves of leather- and wood-bound books, the high windows  lancing darts of colored sunlight into the gloom.  Candles burned smokily in their sconces, lending gloomy illumination to the room, the bee's wax occasionally popping and snapping as an impurity caught flame.  The room was stifling, the afternoon air still, the stone walls absorbing the heat of the sun.  A large desk sat before the cold fireplace, the room comfortably cool in the heat of the day.  The man seated behind the desk sigh at the site of Herman, kneeling in the rushes on the floor.  Placing his quill to the side the man rose, straightening his robe and the large wooden cross hung around his neck.<br/>	The Abbot.<br/>	Abbot Adolphus glared at the young man kneeling on the floor before him, his gray brows furrowing together.  His lips compressed into a thin line as he moved his considerable bulk around the desk to stand before it, hands resting on his hips.  He raised his gaze to focus on the two monks who stood flanking Herman.<br/>	“What has he done?” Adolphus asked.<br/>	The monk on the right stepped forward, clearing his throat.<br/>	“Your Grace, Brother Herman is accused of violating the sacred vows of the order,”  he said.<br/>	The Abbot rubbed his eyes, wiping a sheen of sweat away from his forehead with his sleeve.<br/>	“Which vows, specifically?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.<br/>	“Your Grace,” the monk began, than paused, licking his lips.  His eyes darted about nervously, as if seeking escape.<br/>	“Out with it,” the Abbot barked.  “The heat of the day and your reticence wears on my patience.  Now which vows?”<br/>	The monk paled as the Abbot's gaze bored into him.  He stammered, stopped, and tried again.<br/>	“Your Grace, Brother Herman stands accused of violating all three of our sacred vows.”<br/>	Abbot Adolphus gasped, stepping back, staring at the pale face of Brother Herman as the prostrate monk gazed up at him.<br/>	“Brother Herman,” Adolphus said, catching his breath.  “Are these accusations true?”<br/>	Herman remained silent, bowing his head, hiding his eyes from the penetrating stare of the Abbot.  He shrugged, a feeble gesture.<br/>	Adolphus grimaced, a flush creeping across his face.  His arm lashed out, the flat sound of his palm striking Herman's face ringing in the room.  Herman rocked back, a sharp gasp hissing through his teeth as he tumbled over onto his back.  Adolphus stepped forward, storm clouds raging in his eyes, his mouth a grim, white line.<br/>	“IS THIS TRUE?” he roared.<br/>	Brother Herman whimpered, crawling backwards away from the raging Abbot.  Weeping, he nodded, once.<br/>	Adolphus dropped his arm to his side, his face sagging.  He stepped back, clutching at the edge of his desk, a tremor running through is body.<br/>	“Take this...thing,” he muttered, pointing at Herman  “to his cell and lock him there.  Return to me and tell me everything. Go.  Now.”<br/>	The two monks hurried to obey, scooping Herman up by his arm pits and dragging his limp form from the room, leaving a trail in the rushes.  Adolphus staggered around his desk, falling heavily into his chair, the wood creaking beneath his bulk.<br/>	“Huga,” he called.<br/>	A slim monk, clad in dark woolen robes, stepped from the shadows.<br/>	“Yes, your Grace?” the man asked, bowing.<br/>	“You heard all, I presume,” Adolphus asked.<br/>	“I did, your Grace,” Hugo responded.<br/>	“Good.  I will need you when I pronounce sentence.  Bring me some wine.”<br/>	Hugo bowed, backing from the room.<br/>	“Hugo,” Adolphus caused, pausing the man at the door.  “Contact the mason in  Podlažice, also.  We will have need of him in the morning.”<br/>*<br/>Benedictine Monastery of Podlažice, Bohemia<br/>July 25 ,1227, 4 p.m.	<br/><br/>	The low murmur of voices filled the cloister, the combined mutterings of the brothers of Benedictine gathered together in a single room.  The sound rolled across Abbot Adolphus like ripples in a disturbed pond, the discomfort in the room a palpable force.  Flanked by two of the senior monks of the monastery, he sat on the raised dais before  the altar and the illuminated bible, candles gleaming around him.  Late afternoon sunlight streamed into the cloister, the warmth in the room bringing the sweet smell of fresh rushes to his nostrils, partially masking the odor of the packed-in monks.  Adolphus rose and held up his hands for silence.  Slowly, the murmuring faded, dying away like thick fog before the burning light of dawn.<br/>	“My brothers in Christ,” Adolphus said.  “May God be with you.”<br/>	“And also with you,” the brethren intoned, the sound reverberating in the chamber.<br/>	“My friends, I have gathered you here today to bear witness.  One among you has fallen from Grace, has given in to temptation and vice, and has brought vilification upon both himself and the good name of our holy order.”<br/>	Adolphus paused, surveying the crowd.  A low murmur had begun again and Adophus let it continue for a moment, savoring the effect his showmanship was having.  He held up his hands again, and the mumuring died away.<br/>	“My brothers, we are unified together by our faith,” he said, his powerful baritone carrying easily through the cloister.  “But moreso, by the sacred vows we took when we joined this order.  The vows of obedience, stability, and fidelity.  We hold these vows in the strictest faith and reverence.  Conversatio morum!  In this place we live as monks, in obedience to to its rule, its faith, and its abbot!”<br/>	The last was cast out in a shout, the words ringing across the stone walls and vaulted ceiling.  Many of the gathered bowed their heads, crossing themselves, while around them other monks nodded in silent agreement to the abbot's words.<br/>	“And now, my brothers,” Adolphus continued.  “One among you has cast aside his vows, his sanctity, has spit in the very face of his face of this order and our faith.”<br/>	Throwing his arms wide, the Abbot raised his eyes to the frescoed ceiling.<br/>	“Bring him in!” he cried.<br/>	A door to the side of the cloister boomed open and two monks entered, dragging Brother Herman between them.  He robe had been stripped away, a roughspun breech cloth hiding his nakedness from the assembled brothers.  Fresh lash marks scored his back and legs, shining raw and wet in the soft light of the room.  A collective gasp rose from the monks at the site of the man before them, his head hanging, hair hanging damp and limp from his head.  The monks lifted him up onto the dais and release him.  Herman stood for a brief moment, wavering, then collapsed, sagging first to his knees, than falling forward onto his hands, his breath coming in shallow gasps.<br/>	“Spare your pity for this wretched soul,” the Abbot called.  “He has turned his back on this monastery, so shall we turn our backs on him.”<br/>	“What has he done?” a voice called from the crowd.<br/>	“Nothing,” Herman called weakly, raising his head.  “I have done nothing but be a man.”<br/>	“Indeed, that is exactly what he has done,” the voice of the Abbot boomed out, drowning out Herman's whisper.  “He has forgotten his vows, and in doing so has forgotten himself.  He has abandoned his brothers, ignoring the edicts of this monastery and mingling with the people of  Podlažice as would a commoner, sacrificing his vow of obedience for the dangerous pleasures of the outside world.  He has threatened his very soul with the temptations found outside these walls.  His own letters, found just today within his chamber, speak of his desire to abandon this place and live a life of Godless abandon.  He has cast aside his vow of stability for a wreckless life beyond the reach of God's grace.”<br/>	Distressed whispers began to filter throughout the room, many of the monks shaking their heads.  All had at one time been chastised for disobedience or dreamt of the life they had left behind beyond the walls of the monastery.  None had seriously considered abandoning their faith.<br/>	“But these crimes pale in comparison with his final act of weakness,” the Abbot said.  “This brother, this man whom we have all held within our bosom, has sacrificed the greatest vow of all for the basest of all desires.”<br/>	“He has lain with a woman,” Adolphus said solemny.<br/>	The room dissolved into bedlam, several of the monks turning away.  Cries of “Cast him out” rang from the crowd. <br/>	“Forgive me,” Herman cried, shame writ in the tracks of tears streaming down his face.  “Spare me!  Do not cast me from the light of grace.”<br/>	“Silence,” Adolphus roared.  <br/>	A hush fell across the cloister, the monks tense with anticipation.  Adolphus leaned forward, cupping Herman's chin in his hand, a look of sorrow composed upon his face.<br/>	“How did we let you stray so far from the path, so far from the light to be lost in the shadows, Herman?” he asked.<br/>	“I throw myself upon the mercy of our Lord,” Herman sobbed.  “I have disobeyed the strictures of the brethren, I have dreamed of leaving and tasting the fruits of life that are forbidden us.  But never have I soiled myself on the loins of a woman, or touched her in forbidden ways.”<br/>	“You were seen,” Adolphus said, glancing out at the rapt crowd.  “Several brothers espied you as they aided the sick and the impoverished, sharing ale with a known prostitute.”<br/>	Herman shook his head.<br/>	“No,” he spat.  “I was praying for her soul, for her salvation.”<br/>	“And what part of your prayer, Brother Herman,” Adolphus asked, “involved you resting your weary head upon her bosom?”<br/>	Angry mutterings were beginning to rise among the assembled, several of the monks casting venomous glances towards Herman.<br/>	'Time to end this,” Adolphus thought, releasing Herman and turning to face the crowd.<br/>	“Even now, he lies to save himself, denies his sins before the eyes of those assembled, before the eyes of God himself.”  Adolphus smiled grimly.  “Even now, the truth laid out for him, our brother finds himself still turning away from the light of our Lord.  For these crimes there can be only one punishment, one sure way of cleansing his soul to assure his soul will know the joys of heaven and be spared from the eternal torments of damnation.”<br/>	Adolphus gazed out at the gathered monks, his mouth pulled into a sorrowful frown, his eyes showing nothing but iron.<br/>	“Inclusion,” he said solemnly.<br/>	Cries of horror and protest rang from the assembled monks as Harold cried out in, his despair clawing above the din.<br/>	“No,” he screamed. “You cannot!  You musn't!”<br/>	“I must,” Adolphus responded, his voice carrying over the clamor of the protesting monks.  “I must because your soul must be cleansed.  You will be walled away within your cell, sealed from the light and wind, to fade away in contemplation of your failings and your weaknesses.  Only through this, the most severe of chastisements, can you hope to gain entry to the Kingdom of Heaven.”<br/>	Adolphus turned, gesturing.  Hugo stepped from behind the altar, a large, leather-bound tome held open in his arms.<br/>	“Brother Hugo, please read from the founding laws of our monastery.”<br/>	The other monks quieted, though an angry murmur continued to flow among them.  Hugo drew in his breath and began to read.<br/>	“My brothers, from the Rules of Bendictine, his governing principles and the rules of the church, the word of the abbot is held above all others, his guiding grace the vessel by which we experience and know the guiding light of Christ, our Lord.”<br/>	Hugo paused.  The muttering had died away, the silence broken only by the quiet sobs of Herman.<br/>	“Furthermore, the word of the abbot is absolute, his jurisdiction over the monastery proper and its lands without question.  In his wisdom, may he guide us, maintaining us on the path, and meting out punishment to those who are found wanting.  The abbot is granted the power to punish as he sees fit, including excommunication from the hallowed halls of the church, and, for the most heinous and egregious of sins, inclusion within the walls of the Monastery itself, in hopes the the spirit of this holy place shall permeate the stained soul of one who has committed such acts, and thus cleanse them, clearing the pathway for their ascension into the Kingdom of Heaven.”<br/>	Hugo closed the book, the hollow boom of the heavy binding coming together echoing across the cloister, a wave of sound that carried a note of finality.  The monks remained silent, thoughtful expressions crossing their faces.  Some bowed their heads, looks of chastised sorrow crossing their faces, like children who had argued for an extra sweet before supper and been told no.<br/>	Adolphus smiled inwardly.  They were his again.<br/>	“Brother Herman, you are stripped of your rank and privileges.  You are no longer our brother.  Your name shall be recorded in our annals as Herman the Recluse, so all may remember the darkness of your sin and the punishment it has brought upon you.  You will be retained in your cell for the evening, there to spend the night in prayer so as to prepare yourself.  With the dawn, you shall break your fast one final time.”<br/>	“Wait,” Herman said, rising to his knees, grimacing in pain as the wounds on his back stretched.  Fresh trickles of blood flowed as he straightened.<br/>	“I can prove to you that I have not fallen from the grace of God as you have suggested.”<br/>	“And how exactly do you intend to do that, Herman?” Adolphus asked.  “You simply think to pray and we shall accept that you are a new man?”<br/>	“No,” Herman replied.  “I said I would prove it.  Tonight, sealed in my cell, I shall create a masterpiece, the finest illuminated text the world has seen.  Only with the guiding hand of the Lord shall this be accomplished.  If I have truly fallen so far from grace, surely the Lord and the angels will turn their backs on me, and I shall perish.  All I ask is to be given the supplies I will need for such a task.”<br/>	Adolphus paused, growing thoughtful.  A wry grin spread across his lips. 'Ludicrous,' he thought.  'The most gifted illuminators we have take months to properly create a single text.'<br/>	“And what will this text contain?” Adolphus asked.<br/>	“The Bible, of course,” Herman replied.  “The full text.  The histories of the Jewish peoples.  The medical scriptures of Hippocrates, Theophilus, and others.  The calendar. Other texts as I deem appropriate.”<br/>	“And you believe you will accomplish this in a single evening?”<br/>	“Only with the intercession of the Divine,” Herman replied.  “An impossible task for a single man.  This is the work of years, yet I believe that my innocence of the most damanable of charges laid against me shall warrant the guiding hand of the Lord to flow through my quill.”<br/>	“And if you succeed in this task?”<br/>	“I live,” Herman replied simply.  “Banish me, if you wish, cast me from these walls, but I live.”<br/>	Adolphus scratched at his chin.  The gathered monks waited, collectively holding their breath.  Finally, he nodded.<br/>	“Very well,” he said.  “Though I think you are mad and would better spend your time in quiet contemplation, I cannot deny you your request. Hugo,” he called.<br/>	Hugo stepped forward, still clutching the tome of laws.<br/>	“Gather the supplies he will need.  Quills, hides, binding papers and boards, as well as illuminator's inks.  Deliver them at sundown, no later than the sixth bell.”<br/>	Adolphus stepped forward as Hugo hurried off to fulfill the request.  Dropping to one knee, he stared into Herman's eyes.<br/>	“May God forgive you,” he whispered.<br/>*<br/>Benedictine Monastery of Podlažice, Bohemia<br/>July 25 ,1227, 7 p.m.	<br/><br/>Herman sat in his cell, the heat of the day fading away to the chill of evening as the sun tumbled away behind the mountains.  Scattered about him were his requested supplied, a pile of supple donkey hides, pounded and tanned by the women of Podlažice.  A small jar of quills and numerous stoppered bottles of ink, black for the primary text and the more expensive colored inks for illumination of the text.  End papers and binding boards and leathers.  As the seventh bell faded away, signaling the fall of evening prayers, Herman drew a blank piece of hide to him, unstoppered a bottle of ink, and wet his quill.<br/>	The evening flowed around him as he scribed, the text of the Old Testament flowing slowly onto the page.  The illuminations were rudimentary, the artistry required not a task his unsteady hands were suited for.  He paused constantly to mop his brow as he wrote, the bells of the passing hours tolling quietly throughout the monastery, falling unheard in his cell as he bent his concentration to the task at hand.<br/>	As the single bell tolled the hour of midnight, Herman knew his task was hopeless.  Six pages of poorly illuminated text sat before him, the ink smudged, the leaves dotted with droplets of drying sweat.  His hand curled into a useless claw, his fingers cramped and aching.<br/>	“Please,” he whispered, tilting his head back, his eyes gazing past the ceiling to the unseen night sky.  “Please, Lord, guide my hand, show me that I am still within the light of your Grace.”<br/>	Silence filled the tiny room,  Herman began to weep, quietly, the tears running unchecked down his cheeks.<br/>	“Than I am doomed,” he whispered.  “This cell shall become my tomb.”<br/>	The single candle guttered, the flame wavering as if a breeze had suddenly wafted through the room.  The air was still.  A sudden chill dried the sweat still clinging to his body, gooseflesh crawling across his skin.  The flickering shadows in the corners deepened.  A thin rime of frost formed on the ink bottles.<br/>	“I can help you,” a deep voice called, seeming to emanate from the darkness outside the circle of light cast by the candle.<br/>	“Who is there?” Herman called, crossing himself.  “How did you get in here?”<br/>	“Stone and wood are no bar to me.  I go where I am needed, where desperation has taken hold.”<br/>	The voice paused, a deep-throated chuckle emanating from the darkness.<br/>	“I go where  a deal might be struck.'<br/>	“God will provide for me,” Herman said, his mouth set in a defiant line.<br/>	“Really,” the voice said drily. “How well is that working for you so far?  Five hours and just over six pages completed.  Very impressive.  At this rate you should be completed in, oh, twenty years or so.”<br/>	“I must complete the task this night,” Herman said, his defiance fading as hopelessness washed over him in a dark, cloudy wave.<br/>	“I see,” the voice said.  Herman could sense the presence nodding in the darkness.  “So you think to complete this task in the six or so hours you have remaining.”<br/>	Herman opened his mouth, than closed it, his mind racing.  He knew his task was lost, no possibility of completing the massive text available to him.  His pleas had gone unanswered.  Perhaps the Abbot was right.  Perhaps God had abandoned him.<br/>	“You know the abbot was wrong in his accusations,” the voice said, silky smooth in its deepness.  “You meant nothing by your actions.  You are simply a man of faith, doing your part to bring salvation to those that have fallen from grace.  The woman in the village I'm sure understood.  The few silvers you parted with were to aid in her comfort.”<br/>	Another chuckle, the shadows seeming to vibrate from the sound.<br/>	Herman was shaking now, his fingers trembling as he struggled to contain his laughter.  The entire situation was so ludicrous.<br/>	“That bastard,” he muttered, throaty giggles spitting from his lips.  “That self-righteous, overly pious bastard.  Like he's never dipped his own cock into forbidden pleasures.”<br/>	Herman raised his head, gazing into the shadows.  <br/>	“I've heard the stories,” he said, his voice strengthening as his feeling of despair was replaced by anger.  “All know that he leaves the monastery to go preach.”  Herman spat out the word.  “I wonder how many little bastards he's fathered in town?  How many times has he turned his back on his so-called sacred vows.”<br/>	“So,” the voice asked.  “Is this the man that should be judging you?  One who himself has tasted the fruits of a woman, and found them sweet and succulent?  Oh, the stories I could tell you about our poor, misguided abbot.  They would make your cock shrivel in disgust.”<br/>	Herman struggled to his feet, sharp pains stabbing through his legs as the muscles protested the sudden movement.  Rage suffused him, flushing his skin as his eyes grew wild, any thought of denying the voice fleeing as his anger took him over.<br/>	“Yes,” he cried.  “YES!  What must I do?”<br/>	“Simply ask for my help,” the voice said.  “Ask, and accept my guidance, and the task shall be completed.  That is all.”<br/>	“And what will you take in return?” Herman asked, a sudden fear racing down his spine.<br/>	“Nothing at all, young Herman.  Simply let me guide your hand.  Gather your supplies and your wits.  Close your eyes and reach out your hands.”<br/>	Herman closed his eyes, stretching out his arms, fingers questing.  Something cold and soft brushed against his skin, leaving a burning trail.  He gasped, a dank, rotting smell suddenly filling the cell, followed by the sound of tinkling bells and soft, woman's laughter.  With a start he felt soft hands on his body, stripping away his clothes.  The hands were warm and dry, slightly rough, almost like the scales of a snake sliding across him.  The touch was light, enticing, and Herman felt himself stiffening despite the sudden chill in the air.  He body was lifted and set gently onto his pallet, the stiff wood digging into the wounds on his back.  <br/>	“I shall complete your task, Herman.  My...companions...shall keep you occupied during the night.”<br/>	Herman's words of protest dies in his throat as warm, soft lips enclosed his cock and a a rough, stiffened nipple was pressed against his lips.  He sucked it in greedily, all thought of protest vanishing beneath the wave of sensation engulfing him.<br/>	The deep-throated chuckle of the unseen man filled the room.<br/>*<br/>Benedictine Monastery of Podlažice, Bohemia<br/>July 26 ,1227, dawn<br/><br/>	Weak sunlight peeked over the snow-capped peaks, barely illuminated the thick mist which hugged the grounds and the walls of the monastery.  The tones of the fifth bell had not ceased rolling towards the village when the monk pulled back the heavy bolt holding fast the door to Herman's cell.  The door swung slowly outward, the heavy oak creaking on the hinges.  A breath of fetid, chill air wafted out of the room.  The monk held high his candle, peering into the gloom.<br/>	The brass candle holder clattered to the ground, the flame snuffing out, as the monk fled down the hall, crying for the abbot.<br/>	Herman remained in his cell, blissfully unaware of his discovery, his nude body stained and spotted with ink as he curled around the massive, bound tome the almost filled his tiny cell.<br/>*<br/>	Abbot Adolphus stood in his inner office, uncertainty painted across his face.  Three monks had delivered the text an hour earlier.  It sat on his desk, filling the space, the strange white leather binding the wooden plates almost glowing in the faint light of the candles, the metal hardware piercing the covering gleaming softly in the flickering light.  The book was massive, easily three feet high, over half that in width.  The script was perfect, written by a steady, quiet hand, the illumination unmatched by any Adolphus had seen.<br/>	“Hugo, what shall I do?” he asked. <br/>	Hugo stepped from the shadows, the candlelight casting his hawk-like features into sharp relief.<br/>	“Wall him up,” Hugo said.  “This thing is an abomination.  Wall him up and destroy this...thing.”<br/>	“I cannot,” Adolphus said, sighing.  “We agreed to his terms before all of the brethren.  We cannot turn our backs on that now.  The monastery would dissolve into chaos.”  Adophus shook his head in wonderment as he gazed at the book,<br/>	“No,” he muttered.  “Surely the hand of the Divine is involved in this.”<br/>	“Or the demonic,” Hugo said, stepping closer.  “Your Grace, surely you cannot see the hand of God in this.”<br/>	“No,” the abbot agreed.  “But others may, and that would be enough to threaten us.”<br/>	“So what shall you do than?”<br/>	“Banish him,” the abbot said.  “Expel him from these walls, strip him of his rank within the monastery, forbid his return, demand that he leave the region.  Just get him out of here.  Today.  Within the hour.”<br/>	Hugo nodded, turning without a word and leaving the room.  The abbot was alone, lost with this thoughts, his stare remaining on the book.  With a trembling breath he stepped forward, reaching out and flipping back the heavy wooden binding, carefully turning through the pages, stopping when he reached the images that so troubled him.  On one page, a carefully drafted illumination of the kingdom of heaven, a multi-tiered tower.<br/>	On the opposite page, enscribed in gold, green, and red inks, clad in a robe of ermine, the grinning, capering image of the Devil.<br/>	“Oh, Herman,” Adolphus whispered.  “What have you done?”</p>

<p>     Sarah had not realized she had stepped on a human being until the smell hit her, and then she looked down to see an open-mouthed, glassy-eyed human being below her. The person was charred nearly beyond recognition, except for the person's brown eyes and white eyeballs. Sarah was not even sure if the person had been white, black, Latino, or Asian. There was no way to know. The body was just a mass of charred flesh.<br/><br/>     She stepped back in horror, but there was a tad bit of compassion within her, despite her anger at the male god who had just appeared and expected her to be swept up in his charms. Though the anger did not dissipate, it lessened just enough for Sarah to stop and place her hands upon the charred chest of the burned human being.<br/>As if Sarah had not even had to think about it, the human being instantly lifted his or her head and sucked in a loud gulp of air.<br/><br/>     ""What happened to you?"" Sarah asked the person, kneeling down next to him or her, Sarah's hands still placed upon the person's chest.<br/><br/>     But Sarah did not get an answer. Instead, her head was flooded with whimpers and screams. The person began to flail his or her arms, and the teeth inside the person's mouth practically rattled as the screams of agony got higher and louder.<br/><br/>     The pain in the person's body filled the air around Sarah, and her eyes stung with the realization that she had brought this human being back to life, and yet he or she was suffering. Sarah managed to keep her hands upon the human being, and she frantically tried to envision the human being as being restored to his or her intact, healthy self. Sarah imagined the person with a full head of hair, smooth skin, and strong bones.<br/><br/>     But nothing happened. The person continued to scream, and the person continued to move his or her body wildly, clawing at the air as if by slashing the air, the person could slash their own pain.<br/><br/>     Sarah kept her hands upon the human being, and with tears in her eyes, she envisioned the person returning to the way that Sarah had found her. A force of energy entered Sarah's fingertips just as the human being fell dead once again.<br/><br/>     Sarah ran as fast as she could, the person's pain and terror filling her like an empty well.</p>

<p>hnn. Third book in a series. Last year was the sequel to Burnout Blackout (called ""Crossroads"", which I did get to 50k but haven't even hit typographical review on).</p>
<p>This is either a prequel of sorts (Marsh in the wartime, back when he was young and magic came easy), or it's kind of what I thought <em>Ghost story</em> by Jim Butcher was going to be, i.e. how Harry Dresden came back from the dead.</p>

<p>That’s the last thing I remember thinking before the explosion.</p>
<p>The shockwave slapped me against the wall and dust and grit filled my mouth. I can still see though it’s registering more like something on a monitor than real life. My MHTH eyeshield keeps the grit and sand out. Sounds of gunfire and I roll over, trying to keep myself a moving target.</p>
<p>Gunfire, then as I start to piece things together, crawling across broken glass. Too early to tell if I’m hit and bleeding but the HUD in the MHTH isn’t indicating a spike in blood pressure or anything else indicative of a bullet wood. We’re still not sure how well the physical monitors are going to handle any magical damage.</p>
<p>More gunfire, then. Shouts and screaming. Someone is pulling at me, and I suppress the urge to flip over and stab them a hundred times. Rachel would have told me if they were dangerous, provided Rachel is still online.</p>
<p>Rachel?</p>
<p><em>I’m here.</em></p>

Perhaps it was the precision needed to get the bullets into the chamber, perhaps it was holding six of them and sliding the first one in, holding the other five in his palm at the same time.

1230,Aiea,Novel: Men I Shouldn't Have Dated (& Other Mortifying Truths),Genre: Personal,102302,"3,410",1,"
<p> Non-fiction. Short stories about my life.</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/aiea/novels/men-i-shouldn-t-have-dated-other-mortifying-truths/stats,November 2015,"
<p> Hello. My name is Angela, and this is my story.</p>
<p>I was born on a Thursday, and have always wondered what the phrase “Thursday’s child has far to go” means. Does it mean my whole life will be an uphill battle? Or does it imply that I will go far?</p>
<p>I was born P.O.P., which I believe stands for something along the lines of Persistent Occipedal Posterior, although it’s possible none of those words are correct. It means that, while most children are born facing the floor, I was sunny side up. I like to think that this is some beautiful metaphor for my positive outlook, and how I always seem to make light of bad situations. My mother, on the other hand, suggests that I was born marching to my own drummer. So I guess you can imagine me as somewhere between a Pollyanna and a circus freak, and hope for the best.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I couldn’t pronounce the consonant sounds in Angela. But being the diva child that I was, I wanted to refer to myself in the third-person. This led to me referring to myself as “Ah-ee-ah”, which eventually combined with the pronoun “I”, to sound like something that rhymes with Maya. EYE-yuh. As in, “I, uh, can’t remember your name.” When I was in first grade, I saw a map of the world, and, being the fairly precocious child that I was, understood that “Thailand” sounded like that “TIE-land” country I’d heard of, and though this must be how you spelled the “EYE” diphthong. So I spelled my nickname “Ai-e-a”. And my nickname has been spelled Aiea ever since, despite the fact that I now know that Aya would be far more intuitive. I’ve considered changing it, but now that seems inconvenient.</p>
<p>I was always analytical. From birth, I think. I remember in the fourth grade becoming perplexed by the behavior of a friend and carrying out a week-long study of her actions. The study involved copious notes in the library. I think I watched her for half of recess, and then came and took notes for the other half. I tried to draw conclusions about why the was the way she was. I was ten. (I was a very adult-like child. Which might explain why I’ve chosen to be such a child-like adult.)</p>
<p>And if I spend that much time on the actions of others, I think it’s only fair to say that I should – and do – spend even more time wondering and worrying about myself. At one point, I had a blog about my life, and when I held a contest to come up with a tagline, the winning line was “Overthinking is underrated.” This, you see, is how my readers had come to identify me. The girl who overthinks. </p>
<p>How did I get this way? Was it innate? Perhaps. But it was also encouraged behavior.</p>
<p>I was born left-brained. I’m sure of it. Ticking along methodically. But I had parents who had chosen science fields for their own careers, ignoring their loves of the arts. My mother was obsessed with theatre – particularly of the musical variety, and pushed me towards it. My father played the piano as I drifted off to sleep every night.</p>
<p>The first tape (meaning the kind of tape that you could listen to music on back in the day… oooh, antiquated technology) that I purchased with my own money was the 1967 cast recording of Anything Goes starring Hal Linden and Eileen Rodgers. I was around nine years old at the time. I listened to it so much that I warped the tape, making Eileen sound morose and off-key (which she most certainly was not). Not knowing the actual plot of the musical, I connected the dots in my head, and turned it into the best musical in the world. In actuality, the script is just alright. But the music spoke to me. The song “I Get a Kick Out of You” had a completely different meaning to me out of context. In the show, apparently, Reno Sweeney sings it to Billy in an attempt to cheer him up. It’s her cracking jokes, saying that she prefers hanging out with him instead of doing all the exciting things the kids are doing these days (those days, I suppose). Something like that. But Eileen’s voice sounded so rich and full and sad. I thought of it as a private lamentation. She loved this man so, so deeply, that nothing else brought her joy. She tried literally everything that everyone else got a kick out of, but to no avail. In my mind, she loved Billy with every fiber of her being. He was the only thing that brought her joy. But from her tone, it was clear they weren’t together. Moreover, it was “clear to me/you obviously don’t adore me.” How could the song be anything but tragic when Reno Sweeney was in pain? He didn’t adore her, and oh, how she wanted him to. (I even overanalyze the intentions of characters in musicals to which I don’t know the script. It’s a problem.)</p>
<p>But I’m skipping around. My point: my parents wanted me to be right-brained. They wanted me to be creative and artistic. They wanted me to go into the arts. When I came home with a great grade on a math test, that was nice. But when I got accepted into creative writing camp? Or when I got lines in the school play? When I decided to play the cello? When I joined choir? Those were the moments where they were the most excited and proud. And so, I became a left-brained girl in a right-brained profession. No wonder I love Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Anyway. So here I am. A person who analyzes everything. And now I have a job – as an actor – where I am selling a product, and the product is me. The funny thing about actors is that due to this sales pitch, we are all highly self-focused. Ego-centric, I guess you could say. But because we are constantly applying for jobs that we don’t get, and getting mixed reviews for things we do, and being told we’re too tall, too brunette, not pretty enough… We also have incredibly unstable self-esteem. It seems oxymoronic to anyone who isn’t an actor, but there it is. We seem full of ourselves, but many of us know all of our own flaws. And no one sits alone considering their flaws more than I do. Well, maybe they do, but few of the people who do are both left-brained enough to get down to the nitty gritty AND have been through years of creative writing camp.</p>
<p>So this year, for National Novel Writing Month, I decided to go Rebel. I decided that it was time to get my story back on paper in a way that I haven’t expressed it in awhile. I miss being a blogger. Not because of the readers and fans. Not because of people giving me validation or advice. (I mean, yes, I loved that, it was great, more please.) Rather, it’s because that’s how I worked out so many of my own thoughts on my life. I talk to myself regularly (don’t judge me; apparently geniuses do it, too… not that I’m claiming to be a genius… I’m just saying I’m in good company with the crazy one-sided dialogue). Sometimes I sing myself a lullaby I wrote to calm myself down. But I don’t really dig anymore. To the whys of my life. To the hows, even. </p>
<p>So here goes. Therapy time.</p>
<p>I don’t know what stories I’m about to tell. Which is liberating. And also scary. And this feels so much more personal than anything I’ve done for NaNoWriMo before. Which, of course, makes me nervous. Makes me feel like I’m more likely to give up. But I don’t want to give up. I want to do this right. I want to tell myself stories, even if I never tell them to anyone else.</p>
<p>The NaNoWriMo website asked if I was flying by the seat of my pants, or if I had things heavily planned out and structured. In my own strange way, neither. I haven’t done planning. I don’t know what this will be. But because it isn’t fiction, it feels wrong to say I haven’t planned at all. Because I’m not writing entirely from scratch. I’m not inventing anything, except for what I hope will be interesting ways of telling my stories. So I’m my own person this year. And I’m one of the few, the happy few, the band of rebels.</p>
<p>Here’s the planning that I did: I found a list of everyone I’ve ever kissed. This (for whatever reason) includes all the people I’ve kissed on stage. I don’t have a good reason as to why that is, except that I was probably trying to pad my numbers when I first started out. But if you look at JUST the people whom I have kissed in real life (or, in many cases, people who have kissed me with or without my consent), then there are 32. And I am 31 years old. And have 30 days to write. It seemed like a good place to start. So I have that list. And I added to the list – in a chronological order, of course -- some other names. People that I didn’t kiss. Men who asked me out. Men I asked out. Women who… well, I’ll get to that I guess. Or maybe I won’t. But I suspect I will. After all, I have 50,000 words to write.</p>
<p>So I’ll start by telling my dating stories. I like to think they’re all hilarious, but the truth is, they might not be. I feel like I should include a trigger warning (content warning? What are they calling them these days?), just in case. But honestly, I don’t know how trigger warnings work. So I’ll just say this: if stories of men being jerks might upset you, you should not read this. I’ll try to keep it light, but verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, assault, and harassment will be mentioned. And also death, including the death of a child. You’ve been warned. Reading on is up to you.</p>
<p>But can we just start this by assuming that I’m okay? Like, maybe not totally healthy. I’m a codependent with low-self-esteem. But I’m okay. I’m alive. I’m laughing at all of this. Well, the majority of it. Probably more of it than you will. So don’t worry about me. Laugh where it feels appropriate. And know that, if you’re reading this, you’re probably alone, and I’m not there to know you’re laughing at me, so you’re safe. You’re not going to offend me by laughing at the stupid things I’ve done, Bridget Jones style. Frankly, I’ll be a little upset if you don’t.</p>
<p>But I think you will. Probably some time around the Santa Claus impersonator. Or Kanye West’s choreographer. Or the time I had to dump myself on someone else’s behalf. I’m sure something will tickle your fancy. Or maybe you’ll be so freaking bored that you won’t get to that point. But whatever. I tried. When you write a better memoir, then we’ll talk.</p>
<p>Oh, and because earlier tonight my ex-boyfriend Scott made fun of me for saying I was going to write my memoirs, I would just like to point out that Mindy Kaling has written two volumes of her own. And she’s not much older than I am. And yes, she’s a better writer (although despite what my ex says, I’m quite convinced that she does NOT have a Tony Award, which he claims to have seen when he was doing some sort of construction in her shower). And yes, she’s famous. And yes, she probably has the more interesting life. But that’s not the point. The point is that at 31, you can have had a life worth writing about.</p>
<p>So enjoy. And if you find anything I write to be funny, or moving, or well-written, or whatever, please tell me. Because you may have noticed I have terrible self-esteem. So I could probably use some words of encouragement.</p>

<p> <span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">It is alluring and fruitless to ask “Why”. Perhaps, in the great and final kingdom when my consciousness is no longer impeded by organic matter and the static drudgery of time, I will ask Why. Only then, when I am in a position to begin comprehension, might I even venture the question. But now, mired in my own mortality, stunted and weird from the amputations of sin, I do not ask. Yet in all my grotesque humanity I do still possess independence. So I may not ask the impossible question, but I nevertheless feel wronged and abused.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">I believe, even if it may be ignorance, that I should have never been assigned her ship. From a distance of ten years (a third of my life, a ponderous eternity, an infinitesimal speck in the yawning grandiosity of time) I see a weak boy thrust into temptation he could not resist. It was my pride that led me to the estimable path of Full Cleric and my pride that greeted the challenge of being ship’s priest to an amoral Captain. I put no fault in God’s plans, but I still fail to understand why my betters allowed me to take on such an impossible role.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">She and I met on the Time planet, Janus, before our issue into Arrondissement XXX. I was again stroking my ego and congratulating my own sacrifice by attending the classes on Janus. It would age me considerably, spending five years immersing myself in the physical sciences and engineering workshops necessary to become an Interstellar Self-Sustaining Explorer. My five years on Janus would measure only a mere six months Eden Standard Time (EST). The first years students were thrown a grand feast upon arrival, and I was praised as the youngest of the cohort. The rest of the cohort were aged well beyond me, their youth already spent. Only she, Tamora, was making the great sacrifice of youth as well. It was inevitable that we would become friends.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">It was easy enough to mistake her for ugly at first. I smiled benignly at Tamora, introducing myself in my trimmed clerical uniform. The robes were an unnecessary formality that would have been considered ostentatious in an academic setting. But I could still be identified as one of the Church by my collar and the red and cream long tunic I wore. I noticed a turn to the corner of her mouth that indicated her attraction, and I was flattered but unbothered. I knew I was handsome. I knew that the two youngest of the cohort, stuck together for five years, would inevitably form some kind of superficial attraction. Forgive me, God, but I was so grateful to see she was ugly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">“My name is Laertes,” I offered my hand bravely, offering to touch her mutilated body with my own perfect one. I imagined her weeping as I kissed her terrible skin, grateful and ashamed by my selflessness.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">She gave me a firm handshake, white-blue eyes holding my own and the turn of her mouth curling sensuously as she took me in. “A boy-cleric,” she said in a sing-song accent I could not place. “I did not think they took them so young.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">“I am past twenty,” I said, tugging a little to remove my hand from her grip. She had tattoos of thin steel lining her right hand, as though an x-ray had revealed her as automatronic. I would later notice the same mechanical design on the backs of her knees. The mechanisms shifted with her movements, some kind of mesmerizing moving tattoo. I had heard of these but of course none of the clerics defiled our bodies. I wondered if her tattoos were texturized like paint or branding. Later, I would understand that they were subcutaneous and her skin was as soft and welcoming as any lover’s.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">“Hm,” she measured me again. Her hair was a wild mess, chopped roughly as if she had barely escaped a recent windstorm. Her lips and nose were bulky. Her skin scrawled in tattoos. She was short with wide hips and a flat chest. Ugliness was rare these days and I pitied her. “You may call me ‘Tamora’,” she finally decided, letting go of my hand. “But when we are on my ship you will call me ‘Captain’, understood?”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">I couldn’t help but laugh. Despite the roughness of her language she flashed her own teeth in mimic to my smile. They were sharp and white. “We haven’t been assigned ships,” I told her, “and won’t be for years. Besides, I am graduating these courses to be my own Captain.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">She tilted her chin upward and I noticed how her body moved with her language, as though she were speaking with all of her parts. “We shall see,” she said. “Pleasure to make your acquaintance, Laertes.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">As she left I let my eyes glance at the gross exposures of flesh along her body. She wore a cropped and plain white tunic that ended abruptly without even an attempt to meet her shiny black pants. A bright-tattooed curl of flame flickered out of the waistband along her hip and she walked softly on deft feet. There was something sensual about her, as if she were still part animal. I was repulsed and congratulated myself on such a reaction.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">We were seated by age at the great feast. It was one of the few occasions where I could wear my full red robes, cut perfectly to show off my athleticism and height. The clean lines of the fabric echoed my own attention to a healthy, natural body. I kept my beard at a length that was both decent and masculine. I did not over-preen my eyebrows or spend too much time engaging in vanity, yet I felt assured in my small celebration of the glorious form that God had given me. I gave Tamora a short bow when we glanced at each other before sitting. She had draped herself in a long white gown that was all front and nearly no back. I remember the pang of disgust to see her play at purity, wearing the cream color of the church on her disfigured skin with such a provocative cut, but I said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">When I sat down and raised my glass to her she took her own, but instead of sitting she left to the head of the table. I saw her murmur into the ear of an austere and white-bearded fellow whose eyes immediately lighted upon mine with a sort of cheer. He came to take her place and introduced himself, glad to meet a young man dedicated to both the Church and the Sciences. He talked and bellowed all dinner, never letting me meet any of the other students and barely getting in a word of my own. He was a boor and a glutton. I would catch glimpses of Tamora settled among the nodding elderly, laughing and passing the conversation civilly in turns. Later that evening I admitted my jealousy to myself but I did not see the greater evil budding inside me. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">Tamora played me. She could not have been more than three years my senior and yet she manipulated my emotions expertly. She used her quick feet and demure lilt to get herself into the circles and conversations that I should have been open to me. She was courteous and careful as well as whip-smart, quickly rising in the esteem of our cohort and becoming popular despite her sex, her lewd dress and her maimed skin. She made the class fall in love with her and by doing so, she overcame her own ugliness to become something desirable. I envied and desired Tamora. It began that first night at the feast of the newcomers and burned hotter with each passing day on Janus.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">It would be another two semesters before she would even grant me conversation. I became the audience in my own adventure, backseat to a story that had once been about me. Now each day was measured against her successes. Because I never got the chance to speak at the feast I ended up overeating and, what’s worse, over-drinking. I remained courteous to my overbearing conversation partner but returned to my room dizzy, red, and bloated. I fell asleep playing one image of Tamora over and over in my head, her gently touching the shoulder of an admiral and asking him to pass her a small fruit from a bowl. She had a full plate with prepared steaks, sauteed greens and pureed roots in a rich sauce yet she insisted on nibbling a sweet ripe fruit wrapped in a napkin while lounging in a chair camped among four—four!—of our cohort. I watched her point to the fruit, accept it with graciousness and laughter, and bite into it while licking the juice off the skin. Then it would repeat. The fingers touching the shoulder, the wrist outstretched as she pointed, and the curl of her fingers around a soft, ripe morsel.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">At breakfast I avoided the boor, but as I had failed to introduce myself to anyone else the night before I was at a loss for where to sit. My head ached and my stomach churned—I was too sick for morning exercise and could feel the rings around my eyes as if they were bruises from a fight. Tamora was already seated with a new group of students, gesturing with her hot cup of morning drink and slouching an arm onto the table. Eventually I found a seat but I made a poor conversation partner, exhausted and ill with a headache that only seemed to worsen. I struggled to keep up in class, having forgotten tools in my room and arriving late to multiple courses after getting lost. I missed dinner, falling asleep early in my room.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">I made the gym the next morning, but she was already sprinting on a tredmill. There were others open, but her dress was so distracting I couldn’t bear to be in the same room as her. The girl was running topless—</span><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"">topless!</span><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">—and no one seemed to care! True, it was hard to tell at first. I thought she was wearing a strange green vest but it shimmered and flickered in such a way that I realized it was another tattoo. I could not help myself and I searched for her breasts but she had none—no nipples either. Only flat flesh wrapping her ribcage and beating rhythmically to her pumping blood. She wore only shorts, her thighs and buttocks jiggling with each footfall. She was a barefoot savage, soaked in sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 12pt;"">I took myself to the pool instead, swimming in the nude as God had created me. But it meant I had to set the door to a modesty lock and again I was isolated from my cohort. When I passed the tredmills again she had only just finished, and I had to admire her wild stamina. She was bent over, hands on her knees, breathing deeply. I watched her ribs expand and contract as her belly folded over itself. She glistened in her own saturation. Her eyes looked up and caught mine, and she threw me a smile as if we shared a secret. I hurried away from her, ashamed and confused.</span></p>

<p>The first-person main character keeps dreaming about a man named George. He is perfect for her, the one. But in her heart she also knows she will never love him--not really. Part of the reason why she won't is because she is already married to a woman named Samantha. But as the dreams get more and more out of hand, and as she has to keep interacting with George in the real world, the main character must also explain to herself what love is and why she keeps choosing Samantha.<br/> </p>

<p>Quickly, I cannot say exactly when, but some time within our first interaction, George showed me two things. They were written across his plain, unremarkable face, as if his features has been rendered blank specifically to act as a tablet. They were written in two hands, one a flowing and bright script that was sensual and alluring. The other in my less tidy and often blotted hand, hurried and lacking punctuation. We spoke of nothing important, he delivered to me no shibboleth, nor revealed the charming smile that would have opened my eyes to his secret beauty. There was no single moment, but instead it was a change of situation. As if I had been in a bath and only just realized the heat had gone from the water. Or if I had been immersed in a book only to look up and see a group of strangers specifically watching me. I spoke with George and quietly, quickly, gathered up these two secret notes, written just for me. The first, the most beautiful and delicate, was the sweet declaration <em>He is the one.</em> Yet whatever giddiness comes from such a discovery was obviated by that second, hasty palimpsest: <em>You will never love him</em></p><p> </p><p>I tucked away these bright and terrible pieces of information, buried them like cursed treasure, and hoped that time would serve to dissuade me from my conclusions. It was unlike me to be so brash and stubborn regarding another person. I had always been a thoughtful child, careful to watch where I step and curious to see what others were doing before I made my own choices. I did not run screaming at the waves like my brother, nor did I refuse to play with a visiting child just because they seemed dull. I was then and am now a watcher, the one who survives the play to tell a story that is not their own. The adventures were never meant for me, nor the surety that comes with being given a quest.</p><p>And yet I knew him so well and so suddenly. I recognized him, gently leading a conversation away from sensitive subjects or using his eyes when he listened. He was a watcher. When I saw that the potted plant on our windowsill had toppled, I turned to the kitchen to fetch water and rags. Yet by the time I returned all I found was a clean and righted little tree and George clapping a bit of soil off his hands. When pulled into conversation he responded with loud and welcome laughter but always waited his turn to interject—not even interrupting the women. Between his anecdotes he politely excused himself and stood alone to think. Much as I believed that I knew George, I craved to know what his thoughts were. I wanted to be let into his small and well-guarded confidence.</p><p>I wanted him, even though I knew that I would not really love him. I knew this as surely as I know that a dropped glass falls downward, that hard contact would cause it to shatter, and that the glass could never be pieced together again. I saw the arc and sigh of our romance. I saw the smallness of it and the claustrophobia. I saw the grand, gaping silences. I saw George, standing by the window and watching the trees. I saw so much sadness and still I felt pulled.</p>

<p>An internet video game celebrity meets a cantankerous and kinky Latin textbook publisher and begins a strange but hilarious romance. Their names are both Morgan, just to keep things easy. But shortly into their slippery and boisterous affair something goes wrong in the city of Chicago and APOCALYPSE! It's the day we've all been preparing for, but I think I""ll go for classic EMP burst rather than aliens or zombies. Humans hunting humans is just as scary.</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/aubrette/novels/sexy-apocalypse/stats,November 2013,"
<p>She’d had a bad day. Morgan stood in the chilled April rain of the Clybourn train station waiting for a late Metra to whisk her back home. She tried to imagine warm clothing, a welcome glass of rye, or even her favorite and most dependable vibrator. Anything to get the heat back into her bones. Instead all she could think of was the low and sonorous voice of her college lover reciting The Wasteland while they got (not very) high in their dorm room. April is the cruelest month breeding lilacs out of the dead land… Morgan imagined the creeping shoots and roots of budding greenery sinking into the mouldering corpses buried beneath her. She and her lover had also read Tennyson’s Maude to each other that year.<br/>Their clumsy and unsexy striving for misunderstood anachronism was on par with their breathtakingly bland lesbian tryst. They had both imagined themselves to be someone pretty and haunted, someone full of mystery and deep, painful wisdom. In truth, they’d been girls smoking bags of oregano, apologizing for elbowing a boob or making a weird, fatty, slapping noise and never quite getting wet enough.<br/>“This Tuesday can suck a big fat bag of syphallitic necrotic dicks,” she muttered to herself. Although Eliot had been writing about the exquisite aftershock of a war that had shattered optimism or the basic belief in human good, Morgan liked to think he probably also had Chicago in mind. Spring was particularly gruesome in the windy city, preferring to remain wet and cold for months on end. It was like being stuck in a slushy grey wind tunnel and then thrust into the hot draught of summer. But to be honest, nobody came to Chicago for its weather.<br/>A staticky voice came onto the intercom from god-knows-where and mumbled apologies and vital information which would never, ever be understood. Morgan looked to the figure crouched by a billboard in an attempt to avoid the wet, windy onslaught of Chicago spring.<br/>“What’d he say?” She asked. Sometimes they made the passengers change tracks. The fun part about taking the Metra was that if you missed it, you’d have to wait at least another hour for another chance. She imagined this was what it was like to be a hobo in the olden days, except without the burden of high heels and a brief case. The figure in the black wool peacoat gave a similar mumbled apology and Morgan suddenly realized that the crux of the world’s problems was enunciation. If people treated language with even passing respect maybe there wouldn’t be so much fucking suffering and frustration and missed trains.<br/>She closed her eyes against images of her self-righteously telling this stranger her ideas. She’d had a bad day. The testosterone-addled deposits of nepotism which had recently taken over her department had called her in for a meeting that morning. She had not been fired. That, perhaps, would have been welcome. Instead, she’d been shanghaied into creating a monster for the Latin program. Her Latin program. She was the head editor for the Latin department at her mom and pop textbook company where she had worked for ten years straight out of college. And today some toothsome oaf named Track thought it would be a great idea to include a cartoon buddy with the text, an animated pal to help the drooling students with their intensive conjugation. It was so awful it made her want to spit, but her spit would likely freeze on her cute heeled boots in this kind of wind.<br/>Her murderous reverie was interrupted by the sweeping lights and distant bell of the oncoming train. She squinted her eyes to guess if they were on the right track or not. She’d call a damn cab if she had to miss this train. This, she reminded herself, is why you bike everywhere.<br/>It was the right track. It was not an express. It slowed down and perfectly timed itself so that the doors with the warm, green light of the double-decker passenger train opened right in front of Morgan. She stepped forward into the shivering rain and still too-early night.<br/>“Only room for one of ya,” The conductor said, two feet above her, just on the other side of salvation. This is the moment where I kill someone, Morgan thought to herself in a cool, blank voice.<br/>“Let her go,” said the mumbly stranger in the black peacoat. He was all doubled up on himself as if covering a gunshot wound and Morgan guessed he needed this train as badly as she did. She hesitated.<br/>“I’m just joking with you!” The conductor laughed, “We never turn people away.”<br/>You do if they are bicyclists, she thought to herself, mounting the ultra-high stairs and automatically heading for the bicycle car. She stalled in the doorway, looking at the backs of chairs and backs of heads. She realized she didn’t have the burden of a bicycle this time and could take the opporunity to sit in the upstairs seats. They were smaller, but they were different and to Morgan different always meant fun.<br/>When she sat down and scrambled through her purse for her punch card she noticed the black-coated stranger sitting a few chairs down from her. He unfolded his body to reveal that he had been clutching a brown bag tight to his belly. Uh oh, she thought. Bravely, with the sincerity of one who does not judge, Morgan smiled and offered the drunk a thank you.<br/>“That was nice of you to offer, back there,” she said.<br/>“The conductor is a piss-hat,” he said, smoothing back long black hair that had fallen wet into his eyes. She couldn’t tell if it was grease or rain. “If it weren’t for the fact that this train is so fast they’d never make it with that kind of customer service.”<br/>Morgan loved him the minute he used the subjunctive, an archaic an useless conjugation in the English language but something absolutely critical to all romance languages.<br/>“It was still brave of you,” she said. “Heroic, even.”<br/>“You look like a working lady,” he said, “you’ve probably had a long day. I could take a cab if I had to, this is just faster.” He was patting his pockets, Morgan assumed for his wallet, until he found a small steel jigger. He unbuttoned his jacket and relaxed, apparently in it for the long haul. “Care for a nip? It was kind of brutal out there.”<br/>Morgan usually didn’t take alcohol from strangers, but this had been a bad day after all. Plus, different was fun.<br/>“If it weren’t for how fast this train is,” she said, purposefully using the subjunctive to let him know she knew how clever he was, “and the fact that you can drink on it, they’d have gone under long ago. What are you drinking?” She had taken the offered jigger before hearing her options. It was rude to be picky with free alcohol.<br/>“A birthday present, actually,” he smiled, “a sixty dollar rye whiskey from some place in Evanston. I might as well know if I bought good product for my friend,” he said, pouring her out a hearty nip.<br/>“Well,” Morgan said, already warming up, “you’re all kinds of good luck.” She was feeling flirty now, noticing the not unpleasant way his t-shirt clung to his beefy body. He had a belly on him, but it reminded her of the comfort of a lap cat rather than the repugnance of a beery paunch. And she was starting to like the way his hair matched his eyes, utterly opaque but welcoming nonetheless. Maybe with the whiskey in her, she could even see past the fact that his hair was almost to his chin or the fact that his t-shirt was bright pink with what looked like a smiling marshmallow on it.<br/>She waited for the stranger to put the bottle to his lips and then they drank together. She closed her eyes and the plush grain memories of a good whiskey filled her cold bones. It rippled through her in waves as steady and unrelenting as a good orgasm, curling her toes and making her suck at her bottom lip. Bad ideas were already in the making.<br/>“Oh,” she said, throwing back the last few drops in the jigger, “that’s really good. Your friend is lucky to have someone with such good taste.”<br/>“Too good taste,” he agreed, “I’m not quite ready to cap this up.” He tilted the bottle towards her in question. She held out her tiny cup.<br/>“I have had a bad day,” she said, as if that were an excuse for stealing birthday booze from a stranger.<br/>“Tell me about it,” the now alarmingly handsome young man was saying. Morgan realized he had to be in his twenties. She was flirting with a far younger man and drinking high grade whiskey on a dry ride home. The night was turning around nicely.<br/>“My artistic integrity has been insulted,” she said, “and I’ve been coerced—no, manipulated into fostering the birth of an aberration.” She got wordy when she got drinking.<br/>“Ain’t that a bitch?” he nodded, topping her up. She would make this one last longer.<br/>“Forget what you know of the Latin language and for a moment believe that it is alive and beautiful and holds the memories of millions of people who are reaching out to us across time,” she said, “They have lives and poetry and fantasies and secrets. They are people and people are inherently fascinating. They created this language just as we have made our own, weaving it from the jokes of popular celebrities and the sounds of pretty syllables.”<br/>“Is this a speech you’ve given before?” he smiled.<br/>“I’ve been working on it,” she said, returning his smile and sipping the whiskey. “A nematode comes into my office today—”<br/>“Are we on the same train of thought?” he asked, momentarily lost.<br/>“Yes, I just jump around a bit, hang on with me. A nematode comes into my office today with a plan to get the kiddies interested in old dusty Latin again. It’s a doozy, it’s a whopper—”<br/>“It’s a cartoon,” he guessed.<br/>“Oh my God!” Morgan exaggerated her hand movements, “Is it that obvious? Wait—do you work with me?”<br/>“No, I’m just familiar with your plight. Keep going, I don’t know anything about Latin, I promise.”<br/>“It’s a pig dressed as a gladiator,” she said, grimacing against a burp of air caught with the flash of alcohol. “He wants to call it Porcus Romanus. Because of a popular joke surrounding SPQR. It means Senate and People of Rome, senatus populusque romanus,” she muttered the Latin quickly, unable to help herself, “but the new Italian-speaking Romans like to say it stands for sono porchi questi romani, they are pigs these Romans.”<br/>“So it doesn’t even gel historically?” the stranger asked. “Porcus Romanus isn’t an actual Latin thing?”<br/>“Nope, it’s Italian. But he thought it was a cute idea and would dumb down language learning for kids,” she sighed handing him the jigger. “I’m sorry. I’m babbling and complaining. I assume you’ve probably had just as shitty a day and you’ve been humoring me.”<br/>“Actually,” the stranger said, stoppering up the whiskey and putting it back into its bag, “I’m about to go somewhere amazing. At least when the rain stops.”<br/>“Somewhere amazing?” Morgan asked, unimpressed but nevertheless liking the sound of his voice. “On a Tuesday?”<br/>“Can amazing things not happen on a Tuesday?” The stranger asked. “I can tell you would love it. Would you like to see?”<br/>“How about you tell me what and where this amazing thing is first, and then I consider jumping off a train with a stranger?” Morgan smiled. He was big, far bigger than her, but she was intrigued by his offer. Still, a woman can’t go gallivanting off with strange men in the city, some precaution must be taken.<br/>“Description does it no justice,” he said. “But I’m going to a birthday party to wait out the rain, and then when things calm down I’m taking a small army of clever, bright people to a public space for some kind of reckless beauty thing. Also, the details aren’t totally worked out, my associate is the planner.”<br/>“Hmm…” Morgan said, still not convinced.<br/>“Do you have a smartphone?” he asked. She did. “Take a picture of the two of us together on Facebook, along with my business card and where we are going. Post it to the whole social network and tell them that if you don’t check in tomorrow saying this was the best night of your life then they have to arrest that handsome man immediately.”<br/>“This is some pretty complex guerilla marketing,” she said.<br/>“I can’t convince you, but I guarantee you’d love this. Maybe tonight isn’t the night though,” he said, shrugging. “You could come next time, when you know me better and know what you’re getting into.”<br/>“I’ll only say ‘yes’ when this photo gets posted,” she said opening her facebook app and setting up the camera. “If the internet fails it is God saying you are sociopath and to stay home. Okay, selfie time,” she said, putting her head alongside his to take a picture. They didn’t look bad together, a pair of brown-eyed brown-haired pasty-white Chicagoans in damp peacoats on a train. He handed her his business card and she took a picture of it but was immediately distracted.<br/>“Your name is Morgan?” She asked him.<br/>“Yeah?” he answered warily, as if he might get in trouble.<br/>“My name is Morgan,” she said, showing him her facebook page: Morgan Smith, a safe enough name to flash to strangers.<br/>“Did the internet work?” Boy-Morgan asked. “Did you post the information?”<br/>“Tickets!” The conductor shouted, belatedly making it to their car. He must have forgotten about them or been jerking off in the bathroom, fifteen minutes had passed since they’d boarded. Morgan looked from the boy-Morgan to the conductor and made a decision.<br/>“I’m going where he’s going,” she said.</p>

But when he finally speaks to Lydia Brown will he be able to see past the gloss and glamour of idealism and love her for herself?<br/><br/>A novel about complicated love affairs and the disintigration of the timeline.

<p>His name was bigger than he was. Toby Szczepanczyk watched her from the upper seating on the commuter train. He preferred to sit up high where the chairs were lower and his feet didn’t dangle over the ground. He also didn’t like the feeling of someone reading his book over his shoulder, and in the upper seating his back was to a window.<br/>He could also watch her over the top of his book. Toby was good with women because he usually introduced himself and started a conversation immediately, but something was different about Lydia. She was a cyclist on the train: wearing black tights and neon jackets she looked like a poisonous insect. He imagined iridescent black wings springing from her back.<br/>She was wild to him. She knew the weather intimately, knew the difference between a ten and a fifteen mile per hour wind. He overheard her chatter about panniers, toe clips, derailleurs, ankle biters. She was sleek and intimidating, hefting her bicycle onto her shoulder and skipping up the steep steps of the train. Steps that initially intimidated 5’1 Toby.<br/>The first time he heard her laughing with the conductor he should have asked her name. He should have squeezed his way to the front to de-train with her, chirped to say that they worked in the same building. He could have even started conversation based on the familiarity of riding the same train, both of them laughing happily to find out they’d been working together the past two years without knowing it.<br/>“I work in IT,” he’d say, “though sometimes they bring me in for the Polish translation,” he would add modestly. “That’s a nice bike,” he would compliment her.<br/>But what always happened, without fail, was that he would descend the stairs a little too late. He would get caught up among the shoulders and stomachs, avoiding the corner of a briefcase to his eyes. Toby didn’t need or wear glasses, something his mother had always boasted to his girlfriends. He would squeeze his blue eyes shut and duck his head, shuffling with the crowd as they surged off the train, dropping a precipitous three feet to the not-always-forgiving concrete before starting his day at work.<br/>By the time Toby had steadied himself on the pavement, separated from the aggressively grumpy commuters and regained the glow to his towhead pallor, Lydia was a neon blur in the distance.<br/>It felt as though each time he failed to speak to her a new scatological brick wedged itself into the increasingly brown wall of their separation. Toby was getting desperate. He found himself fantasizing about her at work, imagining her passing a drunken crowd of rowdy college boys. Brazenly, and with the power that comes to a confident short man, Toby would silence the foolish young men. He would shame them, overturning their sexist rocks to uncover misogynistic maggots that cannot survive in his towhead sunlight.<br/>She would joke with Toby then, saying she could take care of herself, but thank you for the support. He would mention that he was the baby of a family of seven, and the only boy. With a laugh the two of them would dive into intimate and revealing conversation. Never once would she mention their twelve-inch difference in height.<br/>Or perhaps he would get the frantic ticket from Lydia Brown, the topaz gem he had been praying for: a hardware failure or a request for installing new devices in her office. She would take an interest in his work, asking how she could repeat this process on her own in the future. He wouldn’t ride in as a chivalrous knight, but as a teacher to an eager pupil.<br/>Toby grimaced. All his fantasies of Lydia, while not sexual in nature, were grotesque nevertheless. He knew he shouldn’t even be fantasizing about her, shouldn’t be dreaming of her or guessing at her life. He needed to know the real Lydia. He needed to meet her and the mundane aspects of her unremarkable life. Toby began to fantasize about becoming disenchanted with Lydia.<br/>She would tell him a Polish joke while walking to work. She would shiver with disgust at the thought of technology encroaching on her hippie lifestyle. She would launch a diatribe against vaccines, poke fun at his height or compare him to a little blond Napoleon. She would be married.<br/>And yet even these hopes became dreams. He could taste the cherry-pink flavor of the iridescent bubble shimmer and bursting on his tongue, just as Lydia Brown melted into mediocrity.<br/>When he saw her, his garralous tongue would contort in shame. He had tattooed her name all over his skin, carved her likeness into his forehead. She would know, just by looking at him, that he was the sort of man who had spent too much time thinking about a stranger. She would pierce her rufous rust-red eyes through his snow-white carapce, cracking into the fetid tomalley. He would be a mess of rotting green garbage on the inane and repetitive pattern of the office carpeting.<br/>And yet a part of him still longed to be lanced by her sharp wit, for his suffering to be relieved by her incisive glare. Toby Szczepanczyk sighed loudly into his computer screen, fogging up the $1200 Macintosh and causing Alessio’s shoulders to jump like electrocuted frogs.<br/>He couldn’t remove Lydia Brown from the center of his nexus. He could not disentagle himself from her invisible webbing.</p>

<p>It would be easier to blame it on insanity. Bella had been living a dream, it had been months of wish-fulfillment without care towards reality. A gorgeous, brilliant, brooding young man--and one of the most popular faces in high school--had seemingly fallen in love with her. It was unthinkable. Not only was Bella a shy seventeen-year-old girl, but she was awkwardly tall, overweight, and generally considered ugly. The more she learned about Edward, the more she cared for him, and he appeared drawn to her peculiarities and humanity. She had fallen in love with a vampire, and bizarrely enough, he loved her back.<br/><br/>Until he didn't. The day came when reality crashed around them and truth won out. Hundred-year-old vampires with supernatural abilities do not fall in love with ugly little girls from small towns. He buoyed up her confidence and then deflated it, leaving behind a stretched-out carcass. Bella was worse off than before she had ever met Edward. And to make things worse, he erased his existence from her life. Had he really loved her? Had he really been a vampire? Was she just insane?</p>

<p>[Rewriting of New Moon, current novel for NaNoWriMo. See below for excerpt from Twilight rewrite]<br/><br/>“We’re leaving,” he said simply. Bella gave a relieved sigh. She had almost thought he was going to break up with her, but he had just been planning their escape together. She had thought this might happen. She’d miss the Cullens, but maybe it was best if she and Edward lived on their own together for awhile.<br/>“When?” She asked, straightening and beginning to plan.<br/>“Now.” He said. “Carlisle can’t pass for his age anymore. He already put in his resignation.”<br/>“Now? Carlisle?” She wasn’t ready to leave, and it would ruin Charlie. He’d already lost his daughter to the Cullens once. But why was the family coming with them if the point was to keep Bella away from Jasper? Edward watched the confusion tangle her face and then smooth as cruelty dawned upon her.<br/>“I’m not part of ‘we’, am I?” She asked in a hollow voice, from the space between emotions.<br/>“No. You are staying in Forks,” Edward said firmly. The spinning started there. Bella shifted from relief to confusion and now began to spiral into panic. Panic and fear. Fear and horror.<br/>“You can’t leave me here,” she said, desperation building in her voice, “Why are you leaving me? I have to be where you are.”<br/>“You have to stay home.” His voice was almost patronizing it was so calm. Why wasn’t he upset?<br/>“You are my home!” Bella’s voice was loud enough that if Charlie were home he might have heard it.<br/>“No, Bella. I cannot be your home. I cannot be human.”<br/>“I don’t want you to be human!” She was shouting uncontrollably now.<br/>“You don’t fit in my world,” he said, angrier now.<br/>“I could if you would just let me! We’re partners in this!” she begged. She felt sick seeing how pathetic she became in front of Edward.<br/>“Bella, I don’t want you to be my partner!” He snapped.<br/>It was as though he hit her. Bella’s head flinched back and she felt stunned. Then, composing himself he said carefully, “You’re no good for me.”<br/>The second phrase hurt her worse because it was a verification of all the doubts she had been harboring. It was too much; the cake [that she'd swallowed earlier], the emotion, the physical pain: Bella felt her mouth water and her stomach lurch. Her breathing sped up and she doubled over, vomiting. Edward stood watching.<br/>She was crying and spitting. This was the worst possible reaction she could have had. A piece of Bella stood outside the situation, watching. From this perspective it was obvious why Edward wouldn’t want her. She finally stopped retching and was able to stand, leaning against a tree. She had no argument to keep him.<br/>“You don’t want me.” She said, panting. “Of course not.”<br/>“Bella?” Edward’s voice was still flat, but the inquisition was almost warm. Did he still care for this messy girl? She looked up hopefully.<br/>“Promise me you won’t do anything…rash.” She stared uncomprehendingly.<br/>“Don’t hurt yourself,” he added.<br/>“You mean suicide, don’t you?” She asked. Edward’s silence was an answer.<br/>“I’m the one who makes you want to kill yourself, not the other way around,” she said venomously.<br/>“Good,” he said, “Charlie wouldn’t be able to take it.” The last line was too much for Bella. Edward really didn’t care for her any more. He only wanted to stay alive for Charlie’s sake. Something inside her snapped, this was real, and she couldn’t physically handle any of it. Her body began to crumble beneath her.<br/>“Please don’t do this,” she whimpered, feeling her legs weakening as the fear set in. He was leaving her. He didn’t love her anymore. Maybe he never loved her.<br/><br/><br/>[Excerpt from rewriting of Twilight]<br/><br/>[Edward] took a paced inhalation and then stopped abruptly, cocking his head slightly. The new girl was late again, and the only open seat was next to him. As she clumsily unloaded books, binders, bags and a coat (didn’t she realize she had a locker?) he dared another small inhalation. He froze, his eyes locked on the girl. Her long hair was pulled back in a rubber band, her button-down shirt didn’t fit properly and he could see a peek-a-boo hole between two buttons. She was wearing a nude-colored bra, cheaply made. She kept hitching up her pants and fussily flipping through binders, trying to find the section reserved for Biology.<br/>But this is not what disturbed him. It was not her pathetic unpopularity, it was not pity. It was intense, lurid, menacing attraction. She smelled incredible. She smelled…tasty. A sea-change occurred in Edward Cullen. He went from the aloof super-model, content to drift through high school existence, to predator.<br/>As he began to plot various plausible situations where the new girl would end up dead and he would saunter freely away, bloated and ecstatic, he edged his seat closer to hers. The teacher was writing parts of the syllabus on the board for some unknown reason, but it gave him time.<br/>“Hello, lab partner.” He said softly. She smiled nervously, avoiding his eyes.<br/>“Hi, my name is Bella. So we’re lab partners for the year?”<br/>“Why yes, Bella. A fortuitous circumstance. You appear to be an intelligent and interesting young woman, and I look forward to getting to know you better. My name is Edward. Cullen. It is a pleasure to meet you.”<br/>“Uh, thanks.” She looked confused and Edward’s quickly darkening eyes turned a deep black, like that of congealed blood. He realized that, on top of smelling savory-sweet, she was also completely silent. Her mind, that is. He could not read her mind. He had a flickering thought and ventured,<br/>“What is your favorite color? –No! Let me guess.”<br/>She stammered and stared. The popular, handsome—scratch that, gorgeous boy was significantly more weird than she had anticipated. He stared back at her intently, listening for a brain wave flicker. She got the feeling that he was a magician, trying to read her mind. She raised an eyebrow.<br/>“Orange?” He finally said, smoothly.<br/>“Ochre.” She said, but sounded surprised, “You got the ‘o’, that was pretty impressive actually.”<br/>But Edward was not impressed. He had not heard a peep from her brain, and she had clearly been thinking. Even babbling idiots think (too much, in his opinion), but he had fleetingly hoped she was just surprisingly stupid. In fact, she was irritatingly mysterious. His eye twitched.<br/>Bella, unnerved by the attention and twitching, turned back to the front of the class, trying to pay attention. But Edward wouldn’t have it. He stretched along the table, leaning on his elbow and getting his face close to hers. He turned on the dazzle.<br/>“Ochre, really? That is utterly fascinating. I would love to learn more about you, Miss Bella Swan. Can I give you a ride home after school today? Maybe we can talk about … colors.” He smiled and smoldered and instinctively inhaled, feeling the empty recesses of his marble body vibrate in a collective purr of pleasure. Such a delicacy, and she was all his.<br/>“Actually I have a car, but thank you.” She tried to turn back to the class again, noticeably uncomfortable and afraid he’d get her in trouble with another teacher on her first day. But he was infatuated.<br/>“That’s funny, because I actually didn’t drive to school today!” He forced a small, quipping laugh, “Can I get a ride home with you, then?”<br/>“Edward, I really need to pay attention to class I can’t get in trouble again,” Bella hissed, leaning in close while keeping her eyes on the teacher. Her hair swung in front of his face and he snorted heavily. But it was too much and he reeled back, overwhelmed and throbbing. He felt the bloodlust coming on. He had welcomed it too heedlessly, he had been greedy. He had wanted to kill her in his magical meadow of pondering, his secret place, where he could rip her open and suck dry the difficult bits (like the yards of intestine). But there was a venomous salivation in his mouth and he stood awkwardly, putting distance between himself and his prey. Not here, not yet.<br/>“Mr. Cullen? Is everything okay?”<br/>“You’re right!” he said crazily responding to the teacher's thoughts, “I think I’m having an allergic reaction. I had some juice and peanuts earlier and—“ he was shaking his head, confused and dizzy. The animal was breaking out and he suppressed growls. Bella stood, concerned,<br/>“Edward?”<br/>“Miss Swan, please escort him to the nurse’s office, it’s just down the hall,” the teacher said, staring but unsure. Edward Cullen had never been a problem in class before. Bella stepped forward, about to take Edward’s arm (she was almost as tall as him and apparently intended to shoulder him over to the nurse’s) but her sudden proximity was too much. Unable to vamp, and unable to control himself, Edward’s body did the only thing it could: it fainted.<br/>The whole class let out a shocked “Ah!” of surprise as the ethereal figure crumpled to the floor. Bella knelt down, cupping her hand under the back of his head, feeling for blood. The teacher was struggling through students, trying to reach them at the back of the lab.<br/>“Edward? Are you okay?”<br/>Suddenly Edward’s eyes flashed open, a coal black rimmed with red, and a hissing gasp snarled his lips. Frightened, Bella dropped his head, letting it smack to the ground again. Her hands flew to her mouth in shame and embarrassment—that is definitely not what you are supposed to do with an unconscious person.<br/></p>

<p>The summer of 1959. With the launch of Sputnik still fresh in the popular consciousness, overambitious, undertalented filmmaker Don Szymanski sets out to shoot his magnum opus in the California desert: ""Attack of the Space Ghoul"". To drum up investor support, he casts Maurice Blakely - a washed-up star from the Golden Age of horror - as the titular monster. In the brutal desert heat, the shoot is plagued with problems, tempers begin to flare- and then Szymanski is found murdered, wearing his own monster suit. With the police stymied, it's up to an unlikely pair- the aging Blakely and the film's wet-behind-the-ears leading lady- to find the killer.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a town so much as a haphazard collection of brick and stone boxes, thrown together to give its residents a tether in the midst of a vast, sun-baked sea of nothingness.  A single, two-lane blacktop snaked between a Mobil gas station, its sign half-eaten by rust and neglect, and a little Mexican-style bodega that offered dust-flecked apples and withered peaches in green wooden boxes by the roadside.  Newspapers were stacked up beside a display board that touted, in shaky chalk letters, the outcome of a baseball game that had been played three weeks earlier.  The town hall-cum-post office, set back from the road a few dozen yards and fronted by a lawn of meager grasses, shrubs, and stones, watched them with the beer-bottle-glass eyes set into its façade of angular stucco.  There were scarcely any people to be seen; they had obviously learned long ago the foolishness of braving the sun’s rays at high noon.  Even with the tinted windows and his bandanna to offer him meager protection, Blakely could still feel those damnable rays, searing the back of his neck like a thousand pokers fresh from the fireplace.  </p>
<p>“How much farther?” he asked, wiping away the sweat.  A spike of pain shot through his hand as he twisted his wrist; he cursed silently and gritted his teeth.  The arthritis was getting worse.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a ways to go yet.”</p>
<p>Already the town’s last buildings were slipping away behind them; only desert and cliffs loomed ahead.  Blakely felt a growing sense of unease.  “Forgive me, but…you do know the way, yes?”</p>
<p>The driver answered with a quick snort of contempt, like a truck’s air brake.  “Listen, Pops, I’ve driven out this way so many times it might as well be a milk run for me.”</p>
<p>Blakely didn’t like to speculate as to what business this fellow might have had with Sal Buongiorno that would need to be discussed out in the middle of nowhere.  He noted the driver’s powerful hands, with the veins standing out against the flesh.  The kind of hands that could wring the life from a person’s neck in seconds, no doubt.  The thought made him shiver down to his marrow, despite the brutal heat.</p>

<p>Winter in this city is like a starving alley cat that’s gotten ahold of a fish carcass.  Even when there’s not a speck of meat left on the bones, even when they’ve been licked gleaming clean, it still keeps its claws on it, still yowls if you try to rob it of its prize.  So too when the end of March is drawing on fast- a time when by rights the trees should be budding, and the green should be making a comeback against the gray- winter digs in and holds on.  The sky changes by the hour: bright and crisp at noon, a sleety hell come sunset.  You can see the despair in people’s faces: please, God, make it end, let the warmth come, let us shed these heavy overcoats and these cumbersome gloves and show our faces to the world again.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what you see in most men’s eyes.  But there are a few who love the cold and the chill- not for its own sake, but because winter is an excuse to hide themselves away, avoid hostile stares and sneers of judgment.  They’re the flotsam and jetsam of humanity- the cheats and the failures, the ones who never could hack it or were just plain too lazy to try.  And they’re my bread and butter, too.  It’s not a good life, and I wouldn’t have chosen it, God only knows.  But sometimes Fate takes you by the hand and gently guides you, and at other times it yanks you up by the shirt collar and hurls you into the dank and the darkness.</p>

With word of the imprisonment of the King, anti-clerical sentiment from the mainland, and an English navy thirsty for plunder crossing the Channel, they closed the monastery and left.

<p>	(derp derp apparently the nano website cannot into indentation)Proof was always the problem. Proof and objective historical fact may have worked for most people, but not for Deborah Burdon. The number of islands above water and habitable before 1750, the Viking relics destroyed by Imperial Spain, the arrival of the Macys on Nantucket to form the Ten Families, not a one of them had a single piece of tangible evidence that she could hold in front of her. She was (and still is) the kind of person for whom faith, believing without proof, was the highest honor she could give. Bereft of her faith in the dogma of the Church, what else was out there that was going to match that?<br/>	Let me use the problem of the witches as an example. Now, like a lot of good old New England names, you would find Halletts and Websters caught up in all kinds of supernatural unsavory; hauntings, even an instance of ghost piracy (a whole procession of ghost pirates on one night, no less!). What we found the most evidence for, and what we ultimately kept coming back to, were the many mentions of Goodie Hallett, a witch who trapped the souls of the living in eternal bondage after death, only to be burned and become a famed ghost herself. While most sources made no mention of her victims, one worn volume on the history of Provincetown from the early 20th century (that was mostly about the rest of the Outer Cape but certainly provided enough details about “contemporary Provincetown culture” to make it worth their while for anyone who wanted a laugh and had been there more recently to peruse), went into a great matter of detail about Hallett's victims and especially focused on a Dan Webster because, unlike the others, he did not vanish when Hallett was executed.<br/>	To the two of us, the possibilities for doomed romances or the Hallett maleficarum spawning battles across the northeast were irresistible to us. Deborah challenged us especially hard on this one by flipping through the tome herself for about a quarter of an hour before she stopped, all of a sudden, and looked up at the two of us. How reliable do you think the connections of these two characters (they were not yet real historical people to her) are in relation to the two families we know?<br/>	I mean they're both from Cape Cod and this happened on Cape Cod. A lot of names were common.<br/>	Couldn't that same commonality just as easily disprove your conclusions?<br/>	Only if you could prove to us that this sort of witch jazz happened all the time.<br/>	She turned the book towards us, a skinny finger in a green knit fingerless glove pointing to a space between two words. The page featured a list of notable witches. The words were “Deborah” and “Burdon”.</p>

<p>Charlotte Black couldn’t remember her parents. She didn’t know if they had been good people or bad people. She didn’t know what their hobbies were, or what her father had done for work. She did not remember a thing about them. Although she grew up in foster homes, Charlotte wasn’t a girl entirely without sense. She was, after all, still alive at the age of sixteen, and fairly well looked after; though, much of that was owed to the fact that she was quiet and mundane.<br/><br/>All of her plans to lead an unassuming life are thrown into disarray the minute she sets foot in Thornton Hall. There is something both eerily familiar and foreboding about the home for children who have no where else to go. When a secret door is unlocked, Charlotte Black steps into a realm unlike anything she had ever seen, but as she delves further into Otherworld, the mysteries surrounding her past begin to unravel. Secrets long kept hidden are revealed and Charlotte learns just what she is made of.</p>

<p>All too soon, morning’s light crept through the windows of her room, and Maxine’s sleep was disturbed by the sound of jack hammers.  At least, she thought it was the sound of jack hammers.  The crunch, crunch, crunch of concrete was actually the sound of her brother masticating his favorite morning breakfast cereal: Captain Crunch.<br/><br/>“Uhng, what are you doing in here?” she asked in a deep, gravelly voice.<br/><br/>“Keep it down, grandma.  You’re going to wake the neighbors.” Crunch, crunch, crunch.<br/><br/>“Seriously, Tom, get out!”  She lobbed her pillow at his head, but missed by two feet.<br/><br/>He picked it up off the gray carpeting and threw it back, smacking her in the side of the face.  Maxine realized her brother was sitting in her desk chair.  She knocked the pillow off of her head and bolted out of bed, lunging for her dark pink, wireless mouse, but Tom had a good grip on it.<br/><br/>“What is wrong with you?” he asked, as he steadied his cereal bowl; it’s contents sloshed dangerously close to the rim.<br/><br/>“What are you doing in my room, on my computer?” she demanded.<br/><br/>“Settle down.  Geez, people might think you’ve got something to hide,” he set the mouse back on the mouse pad crushing a fluffy white kitten as he clicked the buttons.<br/><br/>Maxine set her jaw and crossed her arms.  Trying to take the mouse away from Tom would be the equivalent of climbing a mountain in flip-flops.  He might be lean and not much to look at, but he was older, taller, and stronger than she was.<br/><br/>“My computer is password protected, you know?” she griped.<br/><br/>“Yeah, and it’s got really great security features on it as well,” he laughed and pulled open the top desk drawer.  Amid the number two pencils, colored sharpie markers, fabric push-pins, and shiny paperclips, Maxine saw a scrap of notebook paper in her handwriting with her password emblazoned across it.  She could have kicked herself right then and there, if she hadn’t also been mad about her brother going through her drawer as well.<br/><br/>“Is there no privacy in this house?!” she asked.<br/><br/>“Relax, would you?” said Tom.  He clicked a box with a red X on it and closed the program he had been running.  “I was just resetting the router and checking all of the computers in the house.  The internet should be running more smoothly.  You can go back to looking online at pom-poms and new sneakers all you want, princess.”  Tom rolled his eyes and pushed back on the desk chair.  A disturbing crack came from the wood as he tried to force it to slid across the carpet.<br/><br/>“You should get wheels on that thing,” he said, as he strolled out into the hallway.<br/><br/>“Yeah, thanks for snooping in my room and breaking my chair,” she called after him.<br/></p>

<p>Gunfire, then as I start to piece things together, crawling across broken glass. Too early to tell if I’m hit and bleeding but the HUD in the MHTH isn’t indicating a spike in blood pressure or anything else indicative of a bullet wood. We’re still not sure how well the physical monitors are going to handle any magical damage.</p>
<p>More gunfire, then. Shouts and screaming. Someone is pulling at me, and I suppress the urge to flip over and stab them a hundred times. Rachel would have told me if they were dangerous, provided Rachel is still online.</p>
<p>Rachel?</p>
<p><em>I’m here.</em></p>
<p>What the hell was that?</p>
<p>I groan and roll over to look up at the miasma of iridescent dust filling the warehouse. The smell of burned flesh hits me then and I look down at my clothes. Singed but not on fire. The flame retardants working this time.</p>

One nurse in a blue set of surgical scrubs pushed her way through the crowd and asked people to back away and give her some space to work.<br/><br/>She reached into the mess of feathers and pulled out a human-looking arm. She flipped the wrist over and looked at her watch (who wears a watch anymore?) on her other hand. After a moment, she shook her head. A security officer walked up from behind me and I jumped once I finally noticed him.<br/><br/>He stepped over to the nurse and she shook her head.<br/><br/>“I take it you don’t need the automatic defibrillator or the crash cart?” he asked, A small device in his right hand reminded me of a walkie-talkie from an old movie.<br/><br/>“No. He’s pretty dead.”<br/><br/>I stepped up.<br/><br/>The nurse looked at me and the security officer turned around. “Ma’am, step back. There’s nothing to see here.” He put his hand on his hip as if reaching for a gun that wasn't there.<br/><br/>I held up my hands. <em>Nothing up my sleeve</em>.<br/><br/>“I was wondering if I could be of assistance, actually.”<br/><br/>The nurse rolled her eyes, a slight groan emanating from her lipstick covered lips.<br/><br/>“May I approach? I’m a healer.”<br/><br/>“Do you have a license, lady?” the security officer asked.<br/><br/>“No.”<br/><br/>“Then you can’t legally perform magic on this--"" the security guy gestured at the heap of feathers—“guy.”<br/><br/>“This is a public street, isn’t it?

<p>He decided there was something almost hypnotic to loading a gun. Perhaps it was the precision needed to get the bullets into the chamber, perhaps it was holding six of them and sliding the first one in, holding the other five in his palm at the same time. To him it was a kind of game he played with himself, to load the gun bullet by bullet, holding the ever-diminishing group of bullets in his hand, turning them with thumb and forefinger if needed, and loading them into the gun.<br/>It was a lot like loading batteries into a camera, and after all, in both circumstances, you were going to be shooting somebody.<br/>The bullets themselves felt almost warm. Surely that was from the warmth of his body’s heat transferring into the metal of the jackets, but they somehow seemed warmer than his hand, as if they were… angry? No. That wasn’t the right word.

<p>Mia O’Connor had always been a lone wolf. She was cute and had a select group of friends but still felt out of place in her suburban home outside of Portland. She spent most days broodingly drinking coffee in between college courses and working on her blog. She had her sights set on a job in LA with every intent of leaving behind her old life and never looking back. That is until she met Cooper Randolph, a dreamy high school teacher who showed her that not everything in Portland is worth forgetting.</p>
<p>It only took them from thanksgiving to graduation to fall head over heals with each other and decide to take their relationship long distance when Mia lands the dream job and starts her life in southern California. Immediately she is thrown into the role of Hollywood socialite; immersing herself among friends of the young pop culture elite. Between attending A-List events and being followed around by the paparazzi at every turn, she meets a charismatic actor named Luca who makes her question even the most definitive aspects of her character-including her loyalty to Cooper. While she never cheated on him, when Cooper came to visit months after her move, they both realize their lives were no longer compatible. Cooper was pursuing teaching in Portland and Mia was quickly climbing the social ladder. If only to make things worse, Luca convinces Mia that she has to choose between the two men.</p>
<p>Ultimately she calls it quits with distance to give her Hollywood lifestyle its best shot, only for Cooper to quickly start dating someone new as well. She also quickly realizes that Luca was not exactly who she thought he was. He thrives living the rockstar life even when it becomes destructive through late nights, diva tantrums, and drug use so their relationship quickly becomes dysfunctional. All the while, Mia and Cooper never broke contact and although they weren’t together they found comfort in confiding in one another. However, once Cooper and his new girlfriend announce their engagement, Mia no longer wants him in her life. She never fully moved on but he is starting a life with someone new.</p>
<p>Months go by and Mia stays single, burying herself in her career until she goes home for Christmas. She had been living in LA for almost two years but had only been home to visit once so this homecoming was way over due. She had avoided all of her regular spots in hopes of avoiding Cooper but of course on her last day home she runs into him. They exchange typical pleasantries you would expect from exes asking how they were doing, saying they looked good and mentioning each others relationship status. To her surprise, he broke off his engagement. Although he doesn’t say why and she doesn’t ask, but Mia can’t help but wonder if she was part of the reason. Regardless, they bid each other farewell and it’s obvious they both have a feeling it will be for the last time.</p>

<p>This is an idea that has just recently come to me, so we will see where it goes! Each children's story is juxtaposed with an adult's version of the events. That is why I am calling it a Dual-Perspective Piece. Imagine reading your child a lovely story each night and then enjoying the adult version of it after your little one is asleep. I know that I have wondered where children's book ideas have come from before and have wanted more background on it on some of my favorites (The Giving Tree, Owl Moon, etc.) Henceforth, a new idea is born! </p>

<p><strong>Life under the dome</strong></p>
<p>For the past 200 years Chicago has been encased in a dome, protecting it from the outside world.  Beyond the curved, steel wall lies a wasteland; a stew of nuclear fallout, weaponized viruses and bacteria, and feral packs of animals and survivors.  Inside, life is experienced through the wonders of digital networking.  The town is a constant buzz of 24-hour news, video chats, and ever-circling drones. </p>
<p><strong>Life under a watchful eye.</strong></p>
<p>Jane is depressed.  Considered an outsider, Jane has cut herself off from the digital life, craving true human interaction.  This has cost her friends, family, and anything resembling a relationship.  Spiraling into a deep depression, the constant noise and activity slowly begins to drive her to the very edge of reason.</p>
<p><strong>Life, or something like it.</strong></p>
<p>Jane hears a rumor, a story, a myth, really.  A group of survivors, far beyond the reach of the Dome.  A group that is not dependent on technology to communicate.  A group that lives somewhere where the nights are quiet and the stars still shine at night.  A group known as the Quiet Ones.  But attempting to leave the Dome is illegal, a violation that would change Jane from an outsider to a criminal, someone, certainly, that would be judged insane.  Not to mention the deadly wasteland outside, the fact that she doesn’t know where these Quiet Ones might be, and she’s pretty sure she may have just killed her neighbor and her neighbor’s yappy little dog.</p>
<p>On the other hand, anything would be better than going through life as</p>

<p>Benedictine Monastery of Podlažice, Bohemia<br/>July 25 ,1227, 1 p.m.<br/><br/>	The two robed monks roughly dragged Brother Herman through the halls of the monastery, each with a hand gripping his upper arms.  They moved swiftly, Herman's feet scuffing against the worn cobbles as the monks pulled him along.  Early afternoon light slanted through the windows, casting him into alternating bands of light and shadow.  Herman's eyes remained closed, his lips moving in silent prayer.  The two monks shouldered their way into an inner chamber, unceremoniously dumping Harold to the floor.  The breath left his body as he landed and he was slow rising to his knees.<br/>	Herman straightened, opening his eyes.  His gaze took in the room, a small chamber, the walls lined with shelves of leather- and wood-bound books, the high windows  lancing darts of colored sunlight into the gloom.  Candles burned smokily in their sconces, lending gloomy illumination to the room, the bee's wax occasionally popping and snapping as an impurity caught flame.  The room was stifling, the afternoon air still, the stone walls absorbing the heat of the sun.  A large desk sat before the cold fireplace, the room comfortably cool in the heat of the day.  The man seated behind the desk sigh at the site of Herman, kneeling in the rushes on the floor.  Placing his quill to the side the man rose, straightening his robe and the large wooden cross hung around his neck.<br/>	The Abbot.<br/>	Abbot Adolphus glared at the young man kneeling on the floor before him, his gray brows furrowing together.  His lips compressed into a thin line as he moved his considerable bulk around the desk to stand before it, hands resting on his hips.  He raised his gaze to focus on the two monks who stood flanking Herman.<br/>	“What has he done?” Adolphus asked.<br/>	The monk on the right stepped forward, clearing his throat.<br/>	“Your Grace, Brother Herman is accused of violating the sacred vows of the order,”  he said.<br/>	The Abbot rubbed his eyes, wiping a sheen of sweat away from his forehead with his sleeve.<br/>	“Which vows, specifically?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.<br/>	“Your Grace,” the monk began, than paused, licking his lips.  His eyes darted about nervously, as if seeking escape.<br/>	“Out with it,” the Abbot barked.  “The heat of the day and your reticence wears on my patience.  Now which vows?”<br/>	The monk paled as the Abbot's gaze bored into him.  He stammered, stopped, and tried again.<br/>	“Your Grace, Brother Herman stands accused of violating all three of our sacred vows.”<br/>	Abbot Adolphus gasped, stepping back, staring at the pale face of Brother Herman as the prostrate monk gazed up at him.<br/>	“Brother Herman,” Adolphus said, catching his breath.  “Are these accusations true?”<br/>	Herman remained silent, bowing his head, hiding his eyes from the penetrating stare of the Abbot.  He shrugged, a feeble gesture.<br/>	Adolphus grimaced, a flush creeping across his face.  His arm lashed out, the flat sound of his palm striking Herman's face ringing in the room.  Herman rocked back, a sharp gasp hissing through his teeth as he tumbled over onto his back.  Adolphus stepped forward, storm clouds raging in his eyes, his mouth a grim, white line.<br/>	“IS THIS TRUE?” he roared.<br/>	Brother Herman whimpered, crawling backwards away from the raging Abbot.  Weeping, he nodded, once.<br/>	Adolphus dropped his arm to his side, his face sagging.  He stepped back, clutching at the edge of his desk, a tremor running through is body.<br/>	“Take this...thing,” he muttered, pointing at Herman  “to his cell and lock him there.  Return to me and tell me everything. Go.  Now.”<br/>	The two monks hurried to obey, scooping Herman up by his arm pits and dragging his limp form from the room, leaving a trail in the rushes.  Adolphus staggered around his desk, falling heavily into his chair, the wood creaking beneath his bulk.<br/>	“Huga,” he called.<br/>	A slim monk, clad in dark woolen robes, stepped from the shadows.<br/>	“Yes, your Grace?” the man asked, bowing.<br/>	“You heard all, I presume,” Adolphus asked.<br/>	“I did, your Grace,” Hugo responded.<br/>	“Good.  I will need you when I pronounce sentence.  Bring me some wine.”<br/>	Hugo bowed, backing from the room.<br/>	“Hugo,” Adolphus caused, pausing the man at the door.  “Contact the mason in  Podlažice, also.  We will have need of him in the morning.”<br/>*<br/>Benedictine Monastery of Podlažice, Bohemia<br/>July 25 ,1227, 4 p.m.	<br/><br/>	The low murmur of voices filled the cloister, the combined mutterings of the brothers of Benedictine gathered together in a single room.  The sound rolled across Abbot Adolphus like ripples in a disturbed pond, the discomfort in the room a palpable force.  Flanked by two of the senior monks of the monastery, he sat on the raised dais before  the altar and the illuminated bible, candles gleaming around him.  Late afternoon sunlight streamed into the cloister, the warmth in the room bringing the sweet smell of fresh rushes to his nostrils, partially masking the odor of the packed-in monks.  Adolphus rose and held up his hands for silence.  Slowly, the murmuring faded, dying away like thick fog before the burning light of dawn.<br/>	“My brothers in Christ,” Adolphus said.  “May God be with you.”<br/>	“And also with you,” the brethren intoned, the sound reverberating in the chamber.<br/>	“My friends, I have gathered you here today to bear witness.  One among you has fallen from Grace, has given in to temptation and vice, and has brought vilification upon both himself and the good name of our holy order.”<br/>	Adolphus paused, surveying the crowd.  A low murmur had begun again and Adophus let it continue for a moment, savoring the effect his showmanship was having.  He held up his hands again, and the mumuring died away.<br/>	“My brothers, we are unified together by our faith,” he said, his powerful baritone carrying easily through the cloister.  “But moreso, by the sacred vows we took when we joined this order.  The vows of obedience, stability, and fidelity.  We hold these vows in the strictest faith and reverence.  Conversatio morum!  In this place we live as monks, in obedience to to its rule, its faith, and its abbot!”<br/>	The last was cast out in a shout, the words ringing across the stone walls and vaulted ceiling.  Many of the gathered bowed their heads, crossing themselves, while around them other monks nodded in silent agreement to the abbot's words.<br/>	“And now, my brothers,” Adolphus continued.  “One among you has cast aside his vows, his sanctity, has spit in the very face of his face of this order and our faith.”<br/>	Throwing his arms wide, the Abbot raised his eyes to the frescoed ceiling.<br/>	“Bring him in!” he cried.<br/>	A door to the side of the cloister boomed open and two monks entered, dragging Brother Herman between them.  He robe had been stripped away, a roughspun breech cloth hiding his nakedness from the assembled brothers.  Fresh lash marks scored his back and legs, shining raw and wet in the soft light of the room.  A collective gasp rose from the monks at the site of the man before them, his head hanging, hair hanging damp and limp from his head.  The monks lifted him up onto the dais and release him.  Herman stood for a brief moment, wavering, then collapsed, sagging first to his knees, than falling forward onto his hands, his breath coming in shallow gasps.<br/>	“Spare your pity for this wretched soul,” the Abbot called.  “He has turned his back on this monastery, so shall we turn our backs on him.”<br/>	“What has he done?” a voice called from the crowd.<br/>	“Nothing,” Herman called weakly, raising his head.  “I have done nothing but be a man.”<br/>	“Indeed, that is exactly what he has done,” the voice of the Abbot boomed out, drowning out Herman's whisper.  “He has forgotten his vows, and in doing so has forgotten himself.  He has abandoned his brothers, ignoring the edicts of this monastery and mingling with the people of  Podlažice as would a commoner, sacrificing his vow of obedience for the dangerous pleasures of the outside world.  He has threatened his very soul with the temptations found outside these walls.  His own letters, found just today within his chamber, speak of his desire to abandon this place and live a life of Godless abandon.  He has cast aside his vow of stability for a wreckless life beyond the reach of God's grace.”<br/>	Distressed whispers began to filter throughout the room, many of the monks shaking their heads.  All had at one time been chastised for disobedience or dreamt of the life they had left behind beyond the walls of the monastery.  None had seriously considered abandoning their faith.<br/>	“But these crimes pale in comparison with his final act of weakness,” the Abbot said.  “This brother, this man whom we have all held within our bosom, has sacrificed the greatest vow of all for the basest of all desires.”<br/>	“He has lain with a woman,” Adolphus said solemny.<br/>	The room dissolved into bedlam, several of the monks turning away.  Cries of “Cast him out” rang from the crowd. <br/>	“Forgive me,” Herman cried, shame writ in the tracks of tears streaming down his face.  “Spare me!  Do not cast me from the light of grace.”<br/>	“Silence,” Adolphus roared.  <br/>	A hush fell across the cloister, the monks tense with anticipation.  Adolphus leaned forward, cupping Herman's chin in his hand, a look of sorrow composed upon his face.<br/>	“How did we let you stray so far from the path, so far from the light to be lost in the shadows, Herman?” he asked.<br/>	“I throw myself upon the mercy of our Lord,” Herman sobbed.  “I have disobeyed the strictures of the brethren, I have dreamed of leaving and tasting the fruits of life that are forbidden us.  But never have I soiled myself on the loins of a woman, or touched her in forbidden ways.”<br/>	“You were seen,” Adolphus said, glancing out at the rapt crowd.  “Several brothers espied you as they aided the sick and the impoverished, sharing ale with a known prostitute.”<br/>	Herman shook his head.<br/>	“No,” he spat.  “I was praying for her soul, for her salvation.”<br/>	“And what part of your prayer, Brother Herman,” Adolphus asked, “involved you resting your weary head upon her bosom?”<br/>	Angry mutterings were beginning to rise among the assembled, several of the monks casting venomous glances towards Herman.<br/>	'Time to end this,” Adolphus thought, releasing Herman and turning to face the crowd.<br/>	“Even now, he lies to save himself, denies his sins before the eyes of those assembled, before the eyes of God himself.”  Adolphus smiled grimly.  “Even now, the truth laid out for him, our brother finds himself still turning away from the light of our Lord.  For these crimes there can be only one punishment, one sure way of cleansing his soul to assure his soul will know the joys of heaven and be spared from the eternal torments of damnation.”<br/>	Adolphus gazed out at the gathered monks, his mouth pulled into a sorrowful frown, his eyes showing nothing but iron.<br/>	“Inclusion,” he said solemnly.<br/>	Cries of horror and protest rang from the assembled monks as Harold cried out in, his despair clawing above the din.<br/>	“No,” he screamed. “You cannot!  You musn't!”<br/>	“I must,” Adolphus responded, his voice carrying over the clamor of the protesting monks.  “I must because your soul must be cleansed.  You will be walled away within your cell, sealed from the light and wind, to fade away in contemplation of your failings and your weaknesses.  Only through this, the most severe of chastisements, can you hope to gain entry to the Kingdom of Heaven.”<br/>	Adolphus turned, gesturing.  Hugo stepped from behind the altar, a large, leather-bound tome held open in his arms.<br/>	“Brother Hugo, please read from the founding laws of our monastery.”<br/>	The other monks quieted, though an angry murmur continued to flow among them.  Hugo drew in his breath and began to read.<br/>	“My brothers, from the Rules of Bendictine, his governing principles and the rules of the church, the word of the abbot is held above all others, his guiding grace the vessel by which we experience and know the guiding light of Christ, our Lord.”<br/>	Hugo paused.  The muttering had died away, the silence broken only by the quiet sobs of Herman.<br/>	“Furthermore, the word of the abbot is absolute, his jurisdiction over the monastery proper and its lands without question.  In his wisdom, may he guide us, maintaining us on the path, and meting out punishment to those who are found wanting.  The abbot is granted the power to punish as he sees fit, including excommunication from the hallowed halls of the church, and, for the most heinous and egregious of sins, inclusion within the walls of the Monastery itself, in hopes the the spirit of this holy place shall permeate the stained soul of one who has committed such acts, and thus cleanse them, clearing the pathway for their ascension into the Kingdom of Heaven.”<br/>	Hugo closed the book, the hollow boom of the heavy binding coming together echoing across the cloister, a wave of sound that carried a note of finality.  The monks remained silent, thoughtful expressions crossing their faces.  Some bowed their heads, looks of chastised sorrow crossing their faces, like children who had argued for an extra sweet before supper and been told no.<br/>	Adolphus smiled inwardly.  They were his again.<br/>	“Brother Herman, you are stripped of your rank and privileges.  You are no longer our brother.  Your name shall be recorded in our annals as Herman the Recluse, so all may remember the darkness of your sin and the punishment it has brought upon you.  You will be retained in your cell for the evening, there to spend the night in prayer so as to prepare yourself.  With the dawn, you shall break your fast one final time.”<br/>	“Wait,” Herman said, rising to his knees, grimacing in pain as the wounds on his back stretched.  Fresh trickles of blood flowed as he straightened.<br/>	“I can prove to you that I have not fallen from the grace of God as you have suggested.”<br/>	“And how exactly do you intend to do that, Herman?” Adolphus asked.  “You simply think to pray and we shall accept that you are a new man?”<br/>	“No,” Herman replied.  “I said I would prove it.  Tonight, sealed in my cell, I shall create a masterpiece, the finest illuminated text the world has seen.  Only with the guiding hand of the Lord shall this be accomplished.  If I have truly fallen so far from grace, surely the Lord and the angels will turn their backs on me, and I shall perish.  All I ask is to be given the supplies I will need for such a task.”<br/>	Adolphus paused, growing thoughtful.  A wry grin spread across his lips. 'Ludicrous,' he thought.  'The most gifted illuminators we have take months to properly create a single text.'<br/>	“And what will this text contain?” Adolphus asked.<br/>	“The Bible, of course,” Herman replied.  “The full text.  The histories of the Jewish peoples.  The medical scriptures of Hippocrates, Theophilus, and others.  The calendar. Other texts as I deem appropriate.”<br/>	“And you believe you will accomplish this in a single evening?”<br/>	“Only with the intercession of the Divine,” Herman replied.  “An impossible task for a single man.  This is the work of years, yet I believe that my innocence of the most damanable of charges laid against me shall warrant the guiding hand of the Lord to flow through my quill.”<br/>	“And if you succeed in this task?”<br/>	“I live,” Herman replied simply.  “Banish me, if you wish, cast me from these walls, but I live.”<br/>	Adolphus scratched at his chin.  The gathered monks waited, collectively holding their breath.  Finally, he nodded.<br/>	“Very well,” he said.  “Though I think you are mad and would better spend your time in quiet contemplation, I cannot deny you your request. Hugo,” he called.<br/>	Hugo stepped forward, still clutching the tome of laws.<br/>	“Gather the supplies he will need.  Quills, hides, binding papers and boards, as well as illuminator's inks.  Deliver them at sundown, no later than the sixth bell.”<br/>	Adolphus stepped forward as Hugo hurried off to fulfill the request.  Dropping to one knee, he stared into Herman's eyes.<br/>	“May God forgive you,” he whispered.<br/>*<br/>Benedictine Monastery of Podlažice, Bohemia<br/>July 25 ,1227, 7 p.m.	<br/><br/>Herman sat in his cell, the heat of the day fading away to the chill of evening as the sun tumbled away behind the mountains.  Scattered about him were his requested supplied, a pile of supple donkey hides, pounded and tanned by the women of Podlažice.  A small jar of quills and numerous stoppered bottles of ink, black for the primary text and the more expensive colored inks for illumination of the text.  End papers and binding boards and leathers.  As the seventh bell faded away, signaling the fall of evening prayers, Herman drew a blank piece of hide to him, unstoppered a bottle of ink, and wet his quill.<br/>	The evening flowed around him as he scribed, the text of the Old Testament flowing slowly onto the page.  The illuminations were rudimentary, the artistry required not a task his unsteady hands were suited for.  He paused constantly to mop his brow as he wrote, the bells of the passing hours tolling quietly throughout the monastery, falling unheard in his cell as he bent his concentration to the task at hand.<br/>	As the single bell tolled the hour of midnight, Herman knew his task was hopeless.  Six pages of poorly illuminated text sat before him, the ink smudged, the leaves dotted with droplets of drying sweat.  His hand curled into a useless claw, his fingers cramped and aching.<br/>	“Please,” he whispered, tilting his head back, his eyes gazing past the ceiling to the unseen night sky.  “Please, Lord, guide my hand, show me that I am still within the light of your Grace.”<br/>	Silence filled the tiny room,  Herman began to weep, quietly, the tears running unchecked down his cheeks.<br/>	“Than I am doomed,” he whispered.  “This cell shall become my tomb.”<br/>	The single candle guttered, the flame wavering as if a breeze had suddenly wafted through the room.  The air was still.  A sudden chill dried the sweat still clinging to his body, gooseflesh crawling across his skin.  The flickering shadows in the corners deepened.  A thin rime of frost formed on the ink bottles.<br/>	“I can help you,” a deep voice called, seeming to emanate from the darkness outside the circle of light cast by the candle.<br/>	“Who is there?” Herman called, crossing himself.  “How did you get in here?”<br/>	“Stone and wood are no bar to me.  I go where I am needed, where desperation has taken hold.”<br/>	The voice paused, a deep-throated chuckle emanating from the darkness.<br/>	“I go where  a deal might be struck.'<br/>	“God will provide for me,” Herman said, his mouth set in a defiant line.<br/>	“Really,” the voice said drily. “How well is that working for you so far?  Five hours and just over six pages completed.  Very impressive.  At this rate you should be completed in, oh, twenty years or so.”<br/>	“I must complete the task this night,” Herman said, his defiance fading as hopelessness washed over him in a dark, cloudy wave.<br/>	“I see,” the voice said.  Herman could sense the presence nodding in the darkness.  “So you think to complete this task in the six or so hours you have remaining.”<br/>	Herman opened his mouth, than closed it, his mind racing.  He knew his task was lost, no possibility of completing the massive text available to him.  His pleas had gone unanswered.  Perhaps the Abbot was right.  Perhaps God had abandoned him.<br/>	“You know the abbot was wrong in his accusations,” the voice said, silky smooth in its deepness.  “You meant nothing by your actions.  You are simply a man of faith, doing your part to bring salvation to those that have fallen from grace.  The woman in the village I'm sure understood.  The few silvers you parted with were to aid in her comfort.”<br/>	Another chuckle, the shadows seeming to vibrate from the sound.<br/>	Herman was shaking now, his fingers trembling as he struggled to contain his laughter.  The entire situation was so ludicrous.<br/>	“That bastard,” he muttered, throaty giggles spitting from his lips.  “That self-righteous, overly pious bastard.  Like he's never dipped his own cock into forbidden pleasures.”<br/>	Herman raised his head, gazing into the shadows.  <br/>	“I've heard the stories,” he said, his voice strengthening as his feeling of despair was replaced by anger.  “All know that he leaves the monastery to go preach.”  Herman spat out the word.  “I wonder how many little bastards he's fathered in town?  How many times has he turned his back on his so-called sacred vows.”<br/>	“So,” the voice asked.  “Is this the man that should be judging you?  One who himself has tasted the fruits of a woman, and found them sweet and succulent?  Oh, the stories I could tell you about our poor, misguided abbot.  They would make your cock shrivel in disgust.”<br/>	Herman struggled to his feet, sharp pains stabbing through his legs as the muscles protested the sudden movement.  Rage suffused him, flushing his skin as his eyes grew wild, any thought of denying the voice fleeing as his anger took him over.<br/>	“Yes,” he cried.  “YES!  What must I do?”<br/>	“Simply ask for my help,” the voice said.  “Ask, and accept my guidance, and the task shall be completed.  That is all.”<br/>	“And what will you take in return?” Herman asked, a sudden fear racing down his spine.<br/>	“Nothing at all, young Herman.  Simply let me guide your hand.  Gather your supplies and your wits.  Close your eyes and reach out your hands.”<br/>	Herman closed his eyes, stretching out his arms, fingers questing.  Something cold and soft brushed against his skin, leaving a burning trail.  He gasped, a dank, rotting smell suddenly filling the cell, followed by the sound of tinkling bells and soft, woman's laughter.  With a start he felt soft hands on his body, stripping away his clothes.  The hands were warm and dry, slightly rough, almost like the scales of a snake sliding across him.  The touch was light, enticing, and Herman felt himself stiffening despite the sudden chill in the air.  He body was lifted and set gently onto his pallet, the stiff wood digging into the wounds on his back.  <br/>	“I shall complete your task, Herman.  My...companions...shall keep you occupied during the night.”<br/>	Herman's words of protest dies in his throat as warm, soft lips enclosed his cock and a a rough, stiffened nipple was pressed against his lips.  He sucked it in greedily, all thought of protest vanishing beneath the wave of sensation engulfing him.<br/>	The deep-throated chuckle of the unseen man filled the room.<br/>*<br/>Benedictine Monastery of Podlažice, Bohemia<br/>July 26 ,1227, dawn<br/><br/>	Weak sunlight peeked over the snow-capped peaks, barely illuminated the thick mist which hugged the grounds and the walls of the monastery.  The tones of the fifth bell had not ceased rolling towards the village when the monk pulled back the heavy bolt holding fast the door to Herman's cell.  The door swung slowly outward, the heavy oak creaking on the hinges.  A breath of fetid, chill air wafted out of the room.  The monk held high his candle, peering into the gloom.<br/>	The brass candle holder clattered to the ground, the flame snuffing out, as the monk fled down the hall, crying for the abbot.<br/>	Herman remained in his cell, blissfully unaware of his discovery, his nude body stained and spotted with ink as he curled around the massive, bound tome the almost filled his tiny cell.<br/>*<br/>	Abbot Adolphus stood in his inner office, uncertainty painted across his face.  Three monks had delivered the text an hour earlier.  It sat on his desk, filling the space, the strange white leather binding the wooden plates almost glowing in the faint light of the candles, the metal hardware piercing the covering gleaming softly in the flickering light.  The book was massive, easily three feet high, over half that in width.  The script was perfect, written by a steady, quiet hand, the illumination unmatched by any Adolphus had seen.<br/>	“Hugo, what shall I do?” he asked. <br/>	Hugo stepped from the shadows, the candlelight casting his hawk-like features into sharp relief.<br/>	“Wall him up,” Hugo said.  “This thing is an abomination.  Wall him up and destroy this...thing.”<br/>	“I cannot,” Adolphus said, sighing.  “We agreed to his terms before all of the brethren.  We cannot turn our backs on that now.  The monastery would dissolve into chaos.”  Adophus shook his head in wonderment as he gazed at the book,<br/>	“No,” he muttered.  “Surely the hand of the Divine is involved in this.”<br/>	“Or the demonic,” Hugo said, stepping closer.  “Your Grace, surely you cannot see the hand of God in this.”<br/>	“No,” the abbot agreed.  “But others may, and that would be enough to threaten us.”<br/>	“So what shall you do than?”<br/>	“Banish him,” the abbot said.  “Expel him from these walls, strip him of his rank within the monastery, forbid his return, demand that he leave the region.  Just get him out of here.  Today.  Within the hour.”<br/>	Hugo nodded, turning without a word and leaving the room.  The abbot was alone, lost with this thoughts, his stare remaining on the book.  With a trembling breath he stepped forward, reaching out and flipping back the heavy wooden binding, carefully turning through the pages, stopping when he reached the images that so troubled him.  On one page, a carefully drafted illumination of the kingdom of heaven, a multi-tiered tower.<br/>	On the opposite page, enscribed in gold, green, and red inks, clad in a robe of ermine, the grinning, capering image of the Devil.<br/>	“Oh, Herman,” Adolphus whispered.  “What have you done?”</p>

<p>I stood on the edge of the roof of the abandoned building. Tears stained my cheeks and blurred by vision as I thought about seeing Mom and Dad again.

<p>An earsplitting thunder cracked as bullets shot into the dark sky from below. A silvery–white dragon flew over piercing skyscrapers, accompanied by other dragons in darker shades. The dragons returned fire – deep breaths of incinerating multicolored flames aimed straight at their attackers below. The demons cried a high–pitched screech, leapt into the air, and changed its forms from human to dark–colored, webbed skin, grotesquely winged creatures.</p>
<p>A few of the dragons changed to their human forms, flawlessly landed on their feet, and fired their guns at the screeching demons atop the various glass buildings. Lightning lit the sky, blinding everyone for a fraction of a second before another earsplitting thunder cracked above.</p>

The dragon morphed to his human form, whipping out his gun and firing multiple rounds at the creatures. Several demons were hit straight in the face and lay slumped in dark pools of ichor. Others took flight in a desperate attempt to escape the rain of bullets, only to be charred to the bone by the dragons that flew overhead.</p>
<p>A steady drizzle pelted down as he took sight of an unusually large human with a large handgun pointed directly at him. With piercing red eyes and a sneer, the demon-lord fired. Azure jumped out of the way, swearing, and hid behind a large metal cylinder. He heard the creature calling out to him, challenging him, before firing a few more times. He reloaded his gun and came around, returning the fire. The demon sprang at him ferociously with his teeth bared, ignoring the bullets that pierced him. He jumped into the air and fired at the creature’s chest, but the demon still ran after him, screaming. A bullet pierced the demon’s arm that held his gun and it clattered to the ground. The demon still charged after him, now brandishing a rusted dagger. He punched the demon across the face, but not before the demon had stabbed the blade into his leg. He roared in pain and shot the demon point–blank. The creature went limp, falling over the side of the building. He changed to dragon and took flight, but his form could not hold, so he changed back, free–falling into a dark alley.</p>
<p>He swore as he got up and changed back to dragon form. The form didn’t hold again and he changed back, falling onto his knees and swearing in pain. He saw something flicker from the corner of his eye and turned to face it.</p>
<p>The child stared at him, immobile and unblinking. He swore silently to himself, knowing that she had seen him change. Unpleasant memories flashed across his mind as he remembered the last time a human had seen him. She looked about five years old. He didn’t know why this girl didn’t run from him, screaming, the way the others did whenever they saw his true form.</p>
<p>He grunted from the intense pain on his left leg as he struggled to stand, before falling back on his knees. Blood poured from the deep gash on his thigh, soaking his dark pants. He swore again when he realized he wasn’t healing as fast as he normally did. <em>Was the dagger poisoned?</em> He thought to himself. Sweat and rain blurred his vision as he looked up to where the girl still stood. She had moved closer to him now and wore a look of concern.</p>
<p>“Dragon needs help,” she whispered, “I want to help dragon.”</p>
<p>“Go home kid,” he said, gruffly. “You shouldn’t be out here.”</p>
<p>“Dragon –” the girl began, before he shoved her away.</p>
<p>“Leave me alone!” he roared.</p>
<p>The girl took a step back, frightened by his outburst. “I have to help dragon,” she whispered, before she ran off into the darkness.</p>
<p>~*~*~</p>
<p>Azure sat up, frowning. That dream was strange. He raked a hand through his light hair. He had never thought about that incident and wondered why he dreamt about it now. Maybe he should have killed the girl then and there. Humans weren’t supposed to know about them after all.</p>
<p>He swore as he got out of bed, thinking about the consequences. She was the only human still alive, who knew who he was. It wasn’t that long ago either, about fifteen years probably. <em>But it’s a long time to them</em>, he thought. <em>She wouldn’t be that little girl by now.</em> Humans age and die so quickly, and he hated the fact that he was forced to be in their form. He hated that he could not be himself, in his true form.</p>
<p>He pulled a shirt over his head and belted on his gun. He would find that girl – if she was still alive – he finally decided. He wasn’t sure what he’d do next, though. Hopefully, she didn’t tell anyone or he’d have to kill her on the spot and he wasn’t in the mood for more bloodshed, his job called too much for that anyway. <em>Maybe I should make her join me</em>, he thought. <em>After all, she did say she wanted to help the dragon. </em></p>

It’s not medieval Europe, but all Ella wants to do is go home. Her efforts to find a way back brings her to a quest to slay the damsel–eating dragon until she is taken by the dragon itself!

<p>Chapter 1<br/>And the Rest is History<br/><br/>“A fifty?!” exclaimed Ella, as she held a crumpling paper in her hand. The fifty circled in red seemed to get larger the more she stared at it. She was glad the bell had rung at the same time as her outburst and everyone scrambled for the door, except her best friend Lexie, who sat next to her. <br/><br/>“I’ll see you after class, Miss Jem,” said Ella’s teacher after she had handed the exam back.<br/><br/>“I guess Global’s not your best subject,” commented Lexie, after reviewing Ella’s half-crumpled test paper.<br/><br/>“Of course it’s not my best subject. I hate History!” <br/><br/>“I know, you told me like only a million times.” Lexie packed up her books into her bag.<br/><br/>“My mom’s gonna kill me when she sees this,” Ella muttered, still glaring at the test grade.<br/><br/>“Maybe you should hide it until the next test,” Lexie suggested, as she packed her books and papers into her bag. <br/><br/>Ella glanced at her best friend, who slid by every class with C’s. She didn’t think Lexie was the failing type and wondered what she would do if she did fail. I’m supposed to be the A+ student here! Ella thought to herself in frustration.<br/><br/>“Mom found the last test and flipped out, remember?” Ella said.<br/><br/>“Oh, yeah…but my mom is much worse,” Lexie whispered. <br/><br/>“How you survived being stuck at home for three months straight just for skipping one class freshman year, I will never understand,” Ella stated, giving her a smile. <br/><br/>“It was horrible!” Lexie exaggerated.<br/><br/>Ella glanced at her watch. It was time for her next class: Astronomy – her favorite class of all the classes she’d taken so far at her new high school. Hopefully, this time her mom wouldn’t move and she’d graduate from this school as valedictorian.<br/><br/>Lexie stood up and slung her bag over her shoulder. “Besides, on the last test you got a sixty–seven on it – least you passed.”<br/><br/>“A sixty–seven is like a zero to my mom,” Ella stated. <br/><br/>“I hate to think what a fifty is,” Lexie replied. <br/><br/>“A negative zero,” Ella muttered. <br/><br/>“Well, I better get going – Economics’ my naptime,” Lexie said, smiling. Ella smiled back, shaking her head. That class would bore any normal person to death, even she had to admit. “I’ll see ya after classes.”<br/><br/>“Sure. See ya,” Ella replied. She then packed up her stuff and walked up to her Global History teacher’s desk. The pale, plump woman peered up at her above her thin glasses.<br/><br/>“Ella, you are an excellent student. A+ in all class work, homework and projects. I can’t understand why you failed this test. Did you study?” her teacher said.<br/><br/>“Yes, I did. It’s just I’m not really good at memorizing dates, names…and a few other things,” Ella replied, in a low voice. She really didn’t want to admit that history was the worst subject ever invented, or that she really didn’t care about remembering names and dates.<br/><br/>“Well, can you tell me the order beginning with the highest rank in medieval times?” <br/><br/>Ella thought for a minute. “Uh…king, knight, bishop, noble, serf?”<br/><br/>“No, Ella.” Her teacher sighed and took off her glasses. “Maybe if you did a report –”<br/><br/>“Why can’t I just retake the test?” Ella asked. <br/><br/>“I’m not offering retakes this term. Besides, I am giving you a favor, since you’re my best student,” she smiled. “I am not doing this for anyone else. I will drop both your lowest grades. If you do exceptionally well on this paper, you will pass with an A+, Ella.”<br/><br/>“Okay.” She tried not to pout.<br/><br/>“The paper should be on one of the ranks, explaining its significance to the others. I would also like to know why social class is important in that society. You have until tomorrow to submit it.”<br/></p>

<p>Vanessa Dukane watched as he paused on the marble steps leaning against the gold-plated railing, staring at the Doric capitals. A day which should have been one of celebration was instead somber and dank. She turned off the windshield wipers and headlights, placing the gear into park mode. She thought of honking the horn to get his attention but decided otherwise. This was his first taste of freedom in two years.</p>
<p>He looked much smaller, lissome -- evident as he descended the stairs. When he had been convicted two years ago, Linus Tucker was bulky, a former bodybuilder hobbyist who had grown to enjoy beer and pretzels more than lifting. His beer belly no longer existed. The bulk transformed into lean muscles. His ebony face, hardened, and chestnut-brown eyes, angry.</p>
<p>Vanessa pulled the key from the ignition and stepped out of the black Lincoln MKZ. Her dark brown hair managed to keep its curls despite the drizzle. She stood three and a half inches taller than normal in her Adrienne Vittadini booties. Her skinny jeans and v-neck sweater, Ann Taylor. Glasses, Calvin Klein. Jacket, Ann Taylor. She leaned against the door with her arms resting on the roof of the SUV, and smiled when Linus spotted her.</p>
<p>She couldn't believe how quickly two years had gone by while at the same time feeling as though a lifetime had passed since she last saw him. It felt good to be in his embrace again, although there was much less of him to hug. A friendly kiss on the lips and another hug, then they both got into the Lincoln, tossing Linus's box of belongings in the back. Vanessa smiled wider and longer than Linus who had fallen back into his somber mood. Vanessa rested her hand on his thigh, his hand on top of hers.</p>

<p><br/>I sat up and I froze, doing my best impression of a petrified rabbit cause not only was I not in my bed, and not in NY, but there was someone in this strange bed with me.  Okay *sigh* Going to my happy place for just a moment to figure out what the heck is going on.  I hedgehog rolled out of the bed and slammed HARD into the wall, and banged my head.<br/><br/>“Damnit” I yelped.<br/><br/>“What?  What?  What the hell, came a gruff, sleepy voice from across the room.<br/><br/>It was pitch black, so I couldn’t tell how far away they were, but that didn’t matter.<br/><br/>“Where the fuck am I? Who are you?  Where the fuck are we?  What the hell is going on? I said all in one breath.  <br/>Okay, okay, okay, relax just a minute. I don’t know what the hell you talking about.  Who are you, came the disembodied voice.<br/><br/>What do you mean “Who am I, who ARE you?”<br/><br/>Okay lady, okay okay listen I have… I’m gonna ask you again: Who are you?<br/><br/>I know who I am!  Who the hell are you? What the hell is going on here?<br/><br/>And the other voice said “Shit if I know. This is not my house, sure as hell isn’t my bed! Where the hell am I?<br/><br/>“I have no idea, cause this is not my house either!” As my voice cracked under the strain of whispering loudly.<br/><br/>Okay, said the other voice, and they coughed, clearing their throat.  <br/><br/>What I hadn’t noticed while we sat there playing “Who’s on First” trying to figure out who we were, and where we were, was that I could now see shadows in the room, and the outline of the body from which the other voice was issuing was all of a sudden in my field of vision.  I glanced to my right and saw a thin sliver of light along the horizon at the foot of the bed, like when the sun is peeking in underneath the shade of a bedroom window.  So, I closed my eyes and hunkered down against the wall, moving towards the bed, just scunchin’ down.  I opened my eyes, shifting and looking up I could also now see that there were other occupants of the room. They had not been there before.  <br/><br/>I screamed “What the hell!!!” I reached up in a defensive motion, cause it felt like they were coming towards me.  <br/><br/>How the fuck did..  How is this… person is moving towards me so swiftly and quietly.  They grabbed my arm and pulled me up and I just started flailing away at whoever this was.  I didn’t care.<br/><br/>In the minutes of my struggle, I twisted my head and noticed that the other person, my roommate for what it’s worth, was also being picked up and grabbed.  I was shouting and didn’t realize it: “What the hell, let go of me you fukker, get off of me, what the hell”, doing my best to defend myself.  I couldn’t move very fast, my limbs felt like they were lead. I was half awake, hadn’t had coffee, and was in a strange place; this all makes for less than optimal defensive posture, let me tell you.  And unfortunately I was fighting like a girl at this point in time, and it was obvious after a couple of well placed kicks that there were no nuts for me to strike a blow for freedom from.  Well, I thought that I’d succeeded for a moment cause they dropped me.  I looked up kinda confused and realized that whoever I was fighting with had on like a cross between a gas mask and a scuba mask.  <br/><br/>I’m like: ...</p>

1414,zegota,Novel: Daughters of a Dying World,Genre: Fantasy,12432,414,0,"
<p>The world is sick. In the East, modern cities fester in their decadence, only vaguely aware of a growing discord between the Haves and the Have-Nots. In the West, the empires of old crumble under the weight of tradition. The disease infects even the South, where the nomadic Vulpa have attacked human colonists and even their own tribes in search of dwindling reservoirs. <br/><br/>A young woman treks through a forest, back toward the village that broke her long ago. A girl awakes in a tower, haunted by the expectations and foreboding etched in her mothers face. A woman leaves a prison, only to find the outside world just as confining due to the color of her skin and the brand on her arm. A Vulpa's search for water grows desperate, forcing her to lead her people toward humanity, where they promised never to venture. <br/><br/>A red moon rises in the sky, a harbinger of death and a promise of hope to come. The symbols draws the daughters together in hopes of saving their shared home before the affliction destroys them all.</p>

<p>The railcar hissed and slowed as the driver pulled on a massive lever. “Pátria zona,” he called out. “Market center. Only stop in the zone.”<br/><br/>One of the ladies in the front of the car coughed, but no one stood. Each head rotated in turn as Clara made her way back up the aisle.<br/><br/>“Thanks.” She wondered if she was supposed to tip the man, but he hadn’t done anything other than his job, and rudely at that, so she took the stairs from the car down onto the cobbled platform without another word.<br/><br/>The pátria reminded Clara of herself, and maybe that was why she liked it; neither completely colonial nor nativo, and utterly uncomfortable in its own skin. Crooked signs hung from crooked storefronts, most written in the northern pidgin, a mixture of Dollish and nativo that would be incomprehensible to an outsider of either race. Only half of the lanterns rising from the street actually worked, lending the now darkening market a macabre but oddly fascinating mood. From her left, Clara heard a group of men yelling obscenities in línguanorte, and to her right, some young girls giggled at a joke told in standard colonial Dollish, though the reaction was mixed.<br/><br/>“You’re a funny motherfucker, irmã. You should go to the theatre and perform for all the colonial cuzãos. Just be careful não colocam as suas caralhos em você, yeah?”<br/><br/>That last bit came out to something like “be careful they don’t put their cocks in you,” which Clara supposed would be a genuine worry for a deep brown nativo girl wandering into the upper levels of the city. The citizens there all considered themselves above such nasty business as rape, Clara was sure, but then, many of them thought of the nativos as little more than beasts.<br/><br/>Clara followed Rua Nova straight through the center of the pátria, hoping for a familiar sight, but none caught her eye. Nothing ever stayed the same here. Thermopolia lined the street, complete with vendors offering whole chickens and roasted vegetables to whomever would lend them an ear. In a month, all but a handful would wither away and a new crop would grow in their place.<br/><br/>The bar that caught her attention was not any more attractive than any of the others, but it seemed clean enough. The word “WHISKEY” written in giant letters alongside “BEER” and “AGAVE,” as if the establishment’s name was “WHISKEY BEER AGAVE,” was all Clara needed to know. She ducked under the purple half-curtains blocking the faces of the patrons (of which there was only one) from the outside and sat on the stone bench in front of the counterman, a young man a few shades darker than her with short hair and attractive arms.<br/><br/>An old heavyset man with coriaceous, inky skin hidden behind an ashy grey beard coughed and lifted a finger. “You colonial?” he asked in nativo.<br/><br/>“Mestiça,” she answered.<br/><br/>He grunted and pointed at her arm. “That’s quite a brand you’ve got there, mestiça.”<br/><br/>Merda. She had forgotten about the mark. She leaned toward him and tugged on her sleeve to hide the raised, burnt flesh, like parasitic tendrils under her skin. GTV. An eternal reminder of her crime, and a signal to any who might be tempted to treat her as a normal human being.<br/><br/>“It’s not your business,” she said, louder than she meant.<br/><br/>It attracted the counterman, who made his way to her side of the bench and eyed the both of them. “There a problem here?”<br/><br/>The old man grinned. “Just introducing myself.” Then he threw back his head, slammed a shot of green liquor down his throat, belched and fell onto the table.<br/><br/>“Sorry about that,” the counterman said. “What can I get you?”<br/><br/>“Whiskey,” she said without a thought. “And I want to pay in escudos.”<br/><br/>“I don’t know,” he said, but reached for a glass anyway. “Not really worth much anymore. How much you got?”<br/><br/>“Ten.” She could pay for the liquor in dollars, and she would if it came to that, but she’d rather save that for a room. It would be damned near impossible to pay for shelter with anything else.<br/><br/>“All right, but don’t make it a habit. I can give you some of the cheap stuff. That okay?”<br/><br/>“I don’t care.”<br/><br/>He shrugged and poured a dark liquid into the stubby glass from a nearly full jug. “Oi, Marco, you’re not paid up. Ma Jetta’s kicking you out if you don’t pay tonight.”<br/><br/>The old man waved a hand without looking up. “Ah, fuck Ma Jetta in the ass. I got other places to go.”<br/><br/>“Good, then go. Get the fuck out of my bar.”<br/><br/>Marco stumbled onto his feet and jerked his thumb upward toward the barkeep. A moment later he was gone, though it took several more for his stench to disappear with him.<br/><br/>Clara poured half the glass into her mouth all at once. She swilled it in her mouth, savoring the pleasant burn and anticipating the sweet numbing of her veins that would soon accompany it.<br/><br/>“Slow down, irmã. You only got a little bit, you need to make it last longer. We don’t stay in business by running tabs.”<br/><br/>“The old guy had one,” she said after swallowing.<br/><br/>“Nah, he was renting a room. Told the boss it was a bad idea, but things have been pretty lean, it was worth the chance he might actually kick something our way.”<br/><br/>Clara’s head had already begun to buzz, but the man’s words made a queer sort of sense. “You have a room?”<br/><br/>“Newly vacant. Why, you looking?”<br/><br/>“Maybe.” She took another shot of the whiskey. Only a third of it left now.<br/><br/>“You serious about that? A few centavos ain’t gonna buy you shelter, you know.”<br/><br/>“I have dollars.”<br/><br/>He snickered. “Holding out? I could have brought down the top-shelf shit.” He cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted toward the back. “Oi, Ma Jetta! Got a new tenant for you!” He turned back and poured a dash more of whiskey into Clara’s glass. “Good luck, yeah?”<br/><br/>A moment later, a short, blonde little mouse of a colonial woman stepped out from behind the curtains obscuring the rest of the bar. Her face was replete with Dollish features -- strong, raised cheekbones, a pointed dot of a nose and skin like the flesh of a ghost. Wrinkles had started to invade her skin, but she still managed to look lively and beautiful for her age. Normally, a colonial woman wouldn’t be caught dead here. But business was often the only thing stronger than prejudice.<br/><br/>“Yes, dear, what can I do for you?”<br/><br/>Clara raised her glass toward the counterman. “He said you have a room. I need a place to stay.”<br/><br/>“I see. That can be arranged. How long are you looking for?”<br/><br/>“However long nineteen dollars gives me.”<br/><br/>Ma Jetta smiled warmly, the kind of smile a loving mother gives her daughter. It was entirely unfamiliar to Clara.<br/><br/>“That will do for the night, perhaps. You’ll have to be out in the morning.”<br/><br/>If that’s the best she could manage, it would have to do, but Clara didn’t relish her chances over in the Lowtown slums with the coal workers. “Any work needs doing? I can help.”<br/><br/>“I’m sorry, we’re full up on maids and cooks for the time being.” Jetta clasped her hands in front of her. “And I don’t mean to be rude, but you’re not the kind of girl we normally hire anyway.”<br/><br/>Clara should have been offended by that, but she was used to it. And besides, it was true. She was not, by even the most generous standards, pretty. She was thick in the places a woman ought to be thin and thin in the places a woman ought to be thick. Her face was dirty, her jaw was strong and square, and she never allowed her dark hair, streaked with phthalo blue, to grow longer than the tops of her ears. Mama was Dollish and Papa was nativo and she had gotten the worst traits of each of them.<br/><br/>“Pardon, ma’am, but I can do more if you need me. I’m good with my hands. I can do your lifting, your painting. Anything you have. I worked for my father for years before he passed on.”<br/><br/>Jetta appraised her skeptically, tapping her finger on the countertop. “Do you know anything about steamwork?”<br/><br/>“Yes, ma’am, absolutely I do. Even know my way around thermatalyst.” And this wasn’t a lie. Clara worked steam better than any man she knew, and she knew lots of them, but that field might as well be dead for her. That was man’s work, as they told her, and no amount of talent would ever grant her a spot next to the rail engineers or piston lubers.<br/><br/>But working steam by herself for a private establishment … now that was something with potential.<br/><br/>“Well, we’re having some trouble with our heating. I don’t know if it’s the boiler or the pipes. If you’d like, you can take a look at it, and if you think you can maintain it, I might be able to find a room for you. I can’t pay you, but you’ll have a roof over your head and a full stomach.”<br/><br/>This was the time a normal person would have whooped and hollered and jumped in the air, but Clara was … well, humorless, as Mama always put it, so instead she just bowed her head. “Thank you. I’ll get started right away.”<br/><br/>“And what’s your name, girl?”<br/><br/>Clara wondered how comprehensive Ma Jetta’s inquiries would be, and decided that a lie would serve her best, as it usually did. If Jetta found a recently released criminal working in her employ, Clara would likely be thrown out, and her reputation spread through the city. She racked her mind for a name, and one came quickly. A lunática.<br/><br/>“Lua, ma’am.”<br/><br/>“After the moon?” A small smile appeared on the corners of her lips. “That’s either a very good omen or a very bad one, I’m not sure which. And your family name?”<br/><br/>That one was trickier. She mumbled something to buy herself time, and thankfully, when Jetta asked again, there was an answer on Clara’s tongue. “Cidade, ma’am.”<br/>And thusly Clara Leandra Belvedere Falcão was Clara no longer, but Lua da Cidade, the moon of the city.</p>

1415,zegota,Novel: Chanter: A Song of War,Genre: Fantasy,31171,"1,039",0,"
<p>Music has the power to inspire great men to action, and soothe restless souls. It has the power to paint awe-inspiring scenes of beauty in the mind of the listener. It has the power to shake the ground, bolster armies and carry massive skyships through the air. Literally. The Rota Union has secured power over the continent through their use of Melodicians, talented individuals that can shape the world around them with their music. But as powerful as this ability is, it may not be enough to fend off the hordes from the east.<br/><br/>Professor Nin Rylock, however, is not involved in anything quite that flashy. Nin studies Arithmancy, the mathematical laws that underpin the entire universe, including Melodics. Unfortunately, his research hasn't uncovered many real-world applications as of late. But that may change with his latest discovery: a fundamental equation that would allow Melodics to be used in new and novel ways. But to test it, Nin needs a Chanter. And those are hard to come by. Nin is elated when he stumbles on Layna, an extraordinarily talented Chantress. But with talent comes stubbornness, and getting Layna to cooperate may be more work than it's worth. <br/><br/>When the war comes to their backyard, however, Nin's research comes second to survival. Nin and Layna manage to escape, only to find that Nin's equation has been stolen by the enemy. Now they must put Nin's work and Layna's talents to the test to end the war before it ends them.</p>

<p>        Some equations were beautiful for their simplicity. Some were beautiful for their ability to equate completely unrelated numbers in an elegant way. Some astounded by fashioning real world phenomena as a mathematical formula. Still others were impressive simply because of the sing-song way students memorized them<br/>.<br/>	Professor Nin Rylock’s newest discovery was none of these. As Nin scrawled the last line of ink on the dirty parchment in front of him, he thought about how ugly it was. Irrational numbers, horribly unbalanced fractions, unsymmetrical by it’s very nature -- but still, there was something awe-inspiring about it. Because even though it was complex, inelegant and, if Nin was being honest, clumsy, it worked. Though what it worked to do, he wasn’t quite sure. Even after copying it over and over for months, checking each term for mistakes, he’d found nothing to invalidate it. If Nin were a mathematician, he would have been finished. He could have retired, comfortable in the knowledge that his name would grace hundreds of instructional texts. But Nin wasn’t a mathematician -- he was an arithmancer. And it would take a lot more than numbers on paper to prove the application of his work.<br/><br/>Nin placed the sheet of parchment on an empty spot on his desk to dry. In front of that one sat a neatly stacked pile, fastened together to make a single copy of the equation. He’d loaned others to students and colleagues in hopes that they’d be able to provide input, but so far, they’d given him nothing but pats on the back and blank stares. Without the Melodics to give them voice, the numbers meant just as little to the other Scholars as they did to Nin. And even if he had more to show them, they probably wouldn’t have cared. To everyone else, Arithmancy was a joke.<br/><br/>	But Nin disagreed. To his mind, Arithmancy was life. Not just his life. Arithmancy was all life. Arithmancy was the fundamental science that made rivers flow, lifted mountains from the ground, and fueled the wondrous power of Melodics. Somewhere in those numbers was the power to change things -- to predict when and where the next Chanter would be born, to find the exact point on a wall where a well-placed idiophone would crack it like an eggshell. All of it was in Nin’s grasp. He was close. So close. </p>

<p>Everybody is a tool and they call her an ""organic."" Mercy cannot help but worry about how much of humanity actually made it off Earth and what was abandoned in order to survive.</p>

<p><br/>Rosaline Trent grimaced slightly as she read the latest headline Second Woman Disappears, Authorities Mystified. “I don’t know, Becky. It just doesn’t sound like my cup of tea.”<br/><br/>Deep blue eyes widening, Becky Lewis stared at her friend. “What’s not to like, Rose? It is the hottest club in the city right now and Friday night is Vampire Night. Don’t you want to get all vamped up and watch the pretty people play? I’ve been dying to go to the Black Dahlia.” There was no missing Becky’s excitement. She was fairly vibrating with it.<br/><br/>“I just don’t know, Becks. I’ve got a room to clean out, laundry to do . . . “<br/><br/>“Next you’ll be telling me that you need to wash your hair. Stop being such a shut-in and get back up on the horse. He was a no-good, lying pile of poop but if you don’t start having fun again, he wins. It’s one night. I’ll help dress you up, we’ll take a cab, then cruise the River Walk, listen to the carolers, dance with pretty vampire boys, and drink ourselves silly. It will be F-U-N, but it won’t be as much fun if you aren’t there with me. One night. What d’ya say?”<br/><br/>Rosaline’s green eyes watched her coffee swirl as she idly stirred it, contemplating everything Becky had said. “Okay, one night of fun but I’m not wearing head-to-toe black.”<br/><br/>“Woo hoo!” Becky bounced up and down in her chair, nearly knocking over the table in her exuberance. “I have the perfect outfit in mind, guaranteed to make the vampire king take notice. You’ll be the new Queen of San Antonio!”<br/><br/>Rosaline sighed inwardly, wondering exactly what she had gotten herself into.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>The weather was mild for November. The sounds of carolers on the river barges could be heard over the sounds of the Friday night crowds. Christmas lights lined the bridges and the windows of the curio shops and boutiques. In downtown San Antonio regulars and tourists mingled with the college students who were making plans for mid-term partying. Delicious smells wafted from the many open restaurant doors. <br/><br/>“I cannot believe I let you talk me into this, Becky.” Rosaline’s long stride made it almost difficult for her diminutive friend to keep up as they strode along the downtown river walk.<br/><br/>“It will be fun, and you look great! This place is supposed to be the hottest club in town. It wasn’t easy getting special passes and I knew you hadn’t been out in a while. You need to relax a little, you know. And with tonight being vampire night, it will be great!” There was no missing Becky’s excitement. She was fairly vibrating with it.<br/><br/>Rosaline couldn’t help smiling at Becky’s enthusiasm knowing the girl had more than enough of it for both of them. She took in Becky’s appearance - head to toe black from her stiletto boots to the black jacket to the liner on her blue eyes. Everything was topped by blond curls that bounced with every step. “You look great too, Becks.” <br/><br/>“I still wish you had let me bring the black silk for you, Rose.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, but I’m not exactly a black silk kind of girl, am I?” She caught her own reflection in a window - tight black jeans, black pumps and white blouse with a spill of frothy lace from a deep décolletage set off by layers of pearls and chains. The bright white set off her long, coppery hair to perfection, but all she saw was a gawky tomboy playing dress up. She grinned again as she looked at Becky’s blond curls that bounced as she walked.<br/><br/>“Tell me again how you found out about this place? It’s not your typical haunt.”<br/><br/>“There was this guy . . . “<br/><br/>“Becky, there is always a guy.”<br/><br/>“There was this guy, this really cute guy, putting up fliers in the coffee shop one night after work and he gave me the special passes.”<br/><br/>“I thought you said that part wasn’t easy.”<br/><br/>“It wasn’t easy to just walk away from him. He was hot, very hot! And he was Italian!” Becky Lewis was nothing if not appreciative of a good looking man. Rosaline glanced at her friend, noticing her flushed face and slightly dazed look.<br/><br/>“That hot, huh? Well then, I guess we really should make use of those special passes.”<br/><br/>“Oh look! That must be it.” Becky pointed to a doorway just ahead. A line spilled out, making it difficult for the crowd to squeeze by. Almost everyone in the line was dressed in dark Gothic style. Rosaline thought they looked like funeral attendees. She shook off the morbid thought, determined to have fun even if just to make Becky happy. Then she started noticing little differences - a flash of blue here, some red there, some brass goggles, hard boots, lace, and a couple of fanny packs. This might actually be fun after all. <br/><br/>Becky bypassed the line, grabbing her friend’s hand and taking her straight up to the bouncer. The very muscular man towered over Becky by at least ten inches. She smiled up at him and held out the passes. He looked from her to the passes, then tilted his head toward the door. Becky gave him a sweet “thank you” and pulled Rosaline through the door. <br/><br/>Inside, music throbbed as people moved more or less to the heavy beat of the bass. The club was not as crowded as the line had indicated. She mentioned this to Becky.<br/><br/>“That’s because tonight the special passes are the only way to get in until the king decides who else gets to come in, at least that’s what the hot guy said. Come on, let’s get a drink.” Taking her friend’s hand again, Becky led her to the bar. <br/><br/>Something drew Rosaline’s attention and she turned around. Walking through the door was the most beautiful man she had ever seen. Dressed head to toe in romantic velvets and lace, he looked as if he had walked out of an 18th century painting. In fact, she was sure his outfit had more lace than her own. His brown hair was wavy and longish, just begging to be touched. His alabaster skin would be the envy of many a woman. Then she saw his eyes and gasped. They were a pale icy blue. As he passed by he looked directly at her and gave a half smile. She felt a frisson of excitement run up her spine. She blinked. Was that a trick of the light or did he have fangs?<br/><br/>“Oh my, my, my” breathed Becky. “That is one gorgeous, gorgeous man.”<br/><br/>“Indeed” replied Rosaline, unable to take her eyes off him.<br/><br/>“Rose, I think that’s the vampire king!”<br/><br/>As he moved through the club the crowd seemed to part, making room for him and his friends. That was when Rosaline noticed one of the women who were part of his coterie. Tall and exceedingly slim, her bone straight black hair hung down her back. She wore tight black leather pants, black stiletto heels, and a long black jacket over a black silk blouse which made her skin look deathly white, especially with her black lipstick. Her pale blue eyes were so obviously contacts that Rosaline had to stifle a giggle. When the girl looked at her she gave a much practiced look of sheer ennui and a sneer. The look spoke volumes, most of it hostile. Rosaline broke eye contact first, but turned back to watch the group move through the bar just hoping for another glimpse of the beautiful man. <br/><br/>“I am going to hunt down my special pass friend. Meet you back here in a few.” Becky was moving away before Rosaline could answer.<br/><br/>“Yeah, sure.” Tonight was going to be very interesting after all. She was still watching the group move through the bar, noticing how graceful they all seemed - all of them except the thin girl. She was trying so hard to be like the others in this strange pack, but something about her seemed all out of place. Suddenly the beautiful man turned and made eye contact with Rosaline again. Standing behind the bar, Nick Tustin looked up just in time to see a vision walk through the door. In the sea of Gothic black she stood out like a beacon, and it wasn’t just the green silk hugging her curves. Tall and lithe with coppery hair floating about her in deep waves that begged for his hands, he could only stare. When she turned toward him her green eyes flashed. An almost instant erection nearly floored him — no woman had affected him this way in a very, very long time. As she approached the bar his only thought was of her under him, then he caught sight of what was approaching and had to swallow the growl that threatened to escape his throat. He stealthily adjusted his pants as he walked to where she stood at the bar.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>The bartender walked toward her, giving a smile and a wink. “What’ll you have?” There was no mistaking a true West Texas drawl nor the muscles straining the tight black t-shirt. She peeked over the bar. Yep, cowboy boots and jeans topped it all off.<br/><br/>She smiled. “Red wine.”<br/><br/>He chuckled, laugh lines crinkling at the outer edges of deep blue eyes. <br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“Most of the women tonight are ordering absinthe.”<br/><br/>“Well I’m not most women.”<br/><br/>“No, you certainly are not. Merlot okay?”<br/><br/>“Perfect.”<br/><br/>He turned slightly, and poured the deep red wine from a bottle off the shelf.<br/><br/>“Nick.”<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“I’m Nick.”<br/><br/>“Oh, I’m Rosaline, but everyone calls me Rose.”<br/><br/>“It suits you.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, yeah - because of the red hair. I haven’t heard that one before.” She crinkled her nose in distaste.<br/><br/>“Actually I was thinking more of the beautiful flower way of suiting you, but you can go with whichever makes you happier.”<br/><br/>She looked up at him quickly, mouth dropping open, actually noticing more than the muscles and blue eyes. Dark hair fell over his tanned forehead. The guy in Goth garb might have been beautiful, but this was the kind of man Rosaline dreamed of. There was that trick of light again. Surely this Marlboro man wasn’t wearing fangs. Maybe it was a costume requirement of the employees. Cute gimmick.<br/><br/>Before she could respond, she noticed Nick starting to scowl. “Bon soir.” A French accent caught her ear as a soft hand touched her arm, sending another shiver up her spine. She turned and stared straight into the pale blue eyes of the beautiful man she had noticed earlier. She disappointedly noticed right away that they were contacts, but there was that half-smile again. Does no one actually smile in this place? She took in his garments, that soft hair, the pale skin. He was definitely the whole Vampire package and he was definitely gorgeous. “Ah, Nicolas, a glass of red?”<br/><br/>“Sure, Louie.” She choked back a giggle at Nick’s obvious Southern pronunciation of the name then watched him walk away. He sent another bar tender with the wine but he kept watching from the other end of the bar.<br/><br/>Again the soft hand touched her arm, sending chills dancing down her spine. “I would like to introduce myself. I am Louis Valois. You are delightfully lovely. May I have the honor of knowing your name?” Was that a trick of the light or did this guy have fangs? Yes, he did! Oh dear heavens!<br/><br/>“Louis? Your name is Louis? You’re a vampire? And the French accent? The fangs? Read much Anne Rice?”<br/><br/>“Who? I do not understand. Yes, my name is Louis and yes I am a French vampire. Is this Anne a friend of yours?”<br/><br/>She choked on a giggle and stole a glance at the bartender, who was still scowling. This guy had to be kidding.<br/><br/>“No, Anne is not a friend of mine. I apologize if I was rude. My name is Rosaline.”<br/><br/> ‘She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow do I live dead that live to tell it now.’ <br/><br/>“I beg your pardon?” Rosaline’s brow furrowed in confusion as she looked at the man’s self-satisfied smile. <br/><br/>“I am very pleased to meet you, Rosaline, who shares the name of Romeo’s cruel, first love.” He bent over her hand, placing a kiss on it.<br/><br/>She pursed her lips at bit, feeling that she might have been made fun of, then tipped her head, “Louis, it is very nice to meet you as well.”<br/><br/>“I am the owner of the Mourning Rose. Are you enjoying the club?”<br/><br/>“Um, sure. It’s very nice.” She sipped her wine, wondering why it was suddenly so warm.<br/><br/>“You do not drink absinthe?”<br/><br/>“No, I’m not quite sure what it is but the wine is very nice, thank you.”<br/><br/>“They say that the absinthe will make dreams come true. Who knows? Ah, but the Green Fairy is not for everyone. It is quite an acquired taste.”<br/><br/>Again, she felt the urge to stifle a giggle. Was this guy for real? She sipped her wine and suddenly choked. Louis pulled out a lace handkerchief and offered it to her. “Seriously?” she choked out.<br/><br/>He looked puzzled. “You have dribbled a bit of wine and I thought you might like to dab it away.”<br/><br/>“Seriously?” She took the wispy bit of linen - oh dear heavens, it was really linen! “I couldn’t possibly mess this up with my ‘dribble’ of wine.”<br/><br/>Nick walked over and handed her a bar rag and some club soda. She crinkled her nose and handed it back to him. “No, not that either, thank you.” She held it between her finger and thumb and handed it back across the bar, then reached for a cocktail napkin to wipe the corner of her mouth and dab at her blouse. The bartender leaned back against the bar back, pretending not to listen to their conversation, grinning. Rosaline gave him a puzzled look before turning back to Louis.<br/><br/>“So, you opened a Goth/vampire/alternative bar on the River Walk in San Antonio? Don’t you think a country western bar would have been a better fit?”<br/><br/>“Oh, ma cher, I do believe the crowd speaks for itself, n’est-ce pas?”<br/><br/>Suddenly the thin brunette sidled up to Louis. She turned her practiced look of ennui to Rosaline, summarily dismissing her. “Louis, come darling, I grow bored.”<br/><br/>He did not even look at her. “Go away, Lisette, I am busy.”<br/><br/>“Busy with her?” She looked Rosaline up and down, snarling in the process. The light glinted off what appeared to be fangs in the girl’s mouth. Rosaline turned away to hide a smile she couldn’t stop. Were these people for real? She noticed the bartender watching her. He was trying to hide his own smirk. Louis began arguing quietly with the thin woman.<br/><br/>Becky took that moment to flounce up to the bar, where she caught sight of Louis. “Hello!” <br/><br/>He stopped his quite tirade with the brunette and gave Becky a devastating smile. Yes, they were definitely fangs. “Bon soir, ma belle.”<br/><br/>Becky fell back on her standard eye-batting trying vainly to keep the man’s attention, which was unfortunately quickly lost. He turned back to the woman he called Lisette. Rosaline caught several words in French, not understanding many of them. Becky continued trying to flirt, but Louis only had eyes for her friend once Lisette stomped away. Rosaline, however, was still trying to contain her mirth. It didn’t help that every time she looked up, Nick was grinning, which would send her into another giggle fit that had to be stifled. <br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Quite suddenly, Rosaline felt a push at her back. Lisette and several other girls shoved their way to the bar. <br/><br/>“Hello, Nicky. Bring us absinthe.” Lisette was trying to purr the words as she leaned on the bar, offering what little cleavage she had. Nick was obviously uninterested as he turned to get the bottle. The group turned their attention to Rosaline and Becky.<br/><br/>“You should leave, Red, you’re not wanted here.”<br/><br/>Never one to resist a challenge, Rosaline slowly turned around. Eye to eye with the thin woman, she looked her up and down, much the same way Lisette had done her. “Really? That was not the vibe I got from your friend Louis. In fact, I got the impression that I was very much wanted here. Perhaps I have just a little more to offer.” She straightened and took a deep breath, staring pointedly at Lisette’s flat chest, then turned to lean on the bar. Nick’s eyes went immediately to the lace-framed cleavage. She tossed her red locks back, batted her lashes, then purred and ran her tongue over her lower lip. “May I have another glass of wine, Nick?” <br/><br/>Nick blushed then cleared his throat and stammered “Uh, sure.” She noticed he head to kick his leg a bit before he could actually walk. She was fairly sure he had to make a minor adjustment just so he could stand up straight. For some reason that thought made her very happy.<br/><br/>Rosaline turned back to Lisette, who was now red in the face. “Whore” Lisette hissed. <br/><br/>Becky’s mouth dropped open. Rosaline merely raised one eyebrow. “That’s the best you can do?” Nick set the wine on the bar and Lisette turned to grab it. Just as she drew her arm back to throw the drink at Rosaline, Louis chose that moment to return. He grabbed Lisette’s arm, pulling her away. Rosaline noticed that Nick’s interest in the two suddenly became more pronounced as he watched them closely. She also noticed a very attractive man walk up to Nick, engaging him in what looked to be a very serious conversation.<br/><br/>Louis returned to Rosaline while Lisette and her friends glared, then stomped away.<br/><br/>“I am very sorry you had to witness that. Sometimes women do not handle a break-up well.” He smiled woefully. “It is my hope that she understands soon that what we had is very much finis.” He glanced toward Lisette’s retreating back, then turned back to Rosaline. “Will you sit at my table for a bit? And your friend is welcome, too.” He turned his blue eyes on Becky, taking her breath away. Rosaline looked at Becky, who was totally entranced at this point. “I suppose but just for a bit.” <br/><br/>Louis led the way to a table in the back of the club where the music was not quite as loud, making conversation easier. He pulled out a chair for Becky, then did the same for Rosaline. He touched her shoulder as he pushed the chair in for her, causing her to catch her breath.<br/><br/>“So, where were we?” <br/><br/>“The merits of Goth/vampire/alternative bars in Texas towns and the qualities of absinthe.”<br/><br/>“Ah yes, but perhaps we have exhausted those topics. Let us get to know each other. Tell me about you.”<br/><br/>Rosaline’s mouth dropped open. “Well, there’s not much to say. I have a boring job that I go to every day. I work with my best friend.” Her hand covered Becky’s on the table for a moment. Becky dimpled a smile, then turned her attention back to Louis. “I don’t usually go to bars or clubs, but she convinced me to come tonight. And this is a totally alien scene for me. It’s been a very interesting night.”<br/><br/>“Ma cher Rebecca, I understand you met Orlando the other night. I believe he is at the bar waiting for you.”<br/><br/>Becky’s eyes grew wide. “He is? The hot guy from the coffee shop?” Louis nodded. “Oh Rose, I’ll be back in a bit! I’ve got to go find him!” And with that she was gone.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>“Do you want me to do anything?”<br/><br/>Nick looked at the man next to him. “No, let’s see what happens. All we have right now are suspicions.”<br/><br/>“The police were here earlier.”<br/><br/>“I can deal with them, but for now let’s just see how this plays out. You chatted up the blonde?”<br/>“Tried to but she more interested in Orlando over there” he nodded over toward the corner where Becky sat chatting animatedly with a handsome, dark-skinned man with long black hair.<br/><br/>“That might not have the best of outcomes.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, I know.”<br/><br/>“See what you can do about that.”<br/><br/>“Will do.”<br/><br/>Nick watched Gabe walk away, hoping the man could find a way to get the pretty blonde’s attention. He certainly ask for a better right hand, he thought as moved away to take another drink order.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Louis took Rosaline’s hand and placed a kiss upon the back of it. She suddenly felt breathless and flushed, then found herself leaning in toward him. “I would like to become better acquainted, ma belle. May I see you again?”<br/><br/>She thought about what Becky had said. It was time to get back on the horse. “Um, okay.” She was finding it difficult to concentrate, suddenly wanting him to touch her again. “When?” Was she really saying this?<br/><br/>“Perhaps Friday night? Here?”<br/><br/>It was more difficult to breathe. “Okay, Friday night.”<br/><br/>There was that half-smile. Good heavens, he was so beautiful! “Go find Rebecca, Rosaline. I will see you later in the week. It has been un plaisir.” He kissed her hand again, causing her to catch her breath. He pulled the chair out for her as she stood on wobbly legs. When he kissed her cheek, she thought those legs might just give out. <br/><br/>She made her way a table in the corner where she found Becky talking to an exceedingly handsome dark-haired man. His dress was similar to that of Louis’. <br/><br/>“Rose! This is Orlando, the guy who gave me passes.” Becky had her arm entwined through Orlando’s. <br/><br/>“Signorina, a pleasure.” Rosaline took in the dark eyes and olive skin, the great cheekbones, the black hair that begged to be touched - this guy could give Fabio a run for his money. At least he wasn’t wearing pale blue contacts.<br/><br/>“It’s very nice to meet you, Orlando.” She turned to her friend. “Becky, do you think we could leave soon? I’m really tired and my head is pounding.”<br/><br/>“Um, sure.” Becky tried to hide her disappointment. “Orlando, here is my phone number.” She was writing on the palm of his hand.<br/><br/>“Ah bella mia, I will call you soon and we will have more time. Be a good friend and take Rosaline home.” He winked at Becky and bent over her hand, giving her an old-fashioned kiss on the hand much like Louis had just done. Then he gave Rosaline a smile before walking away, disappearing into the crowd.<br/><br/>“Wow.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, wow” Rosaline agreed wholeheartedly.<br/><br/>“I’m gonna find the lady’s room. I’ll meet you at the door, okay?” Becky hurried off, not waiting for a reply.<br/><br/>“Yeah, sure.” As she turned to leave, she looked for Nick. He was watching Orlando walk through the club. The look on his face was frighteningly hostile, then he turn toward her and smiled. She gave him a little wave as she and Becky turned toward the exit. She felt his eyes on her all the way to the door.<br/><br/>*****<br/>Making her way through the crowd, Rosaline was well aware that Louis and his entourage were still moving through the crowd causing quite a stir. He truly was beautiful and she could certainly understand how he turned heads. He was also definitely caught up in he own story.<br/>She finally found Becky, sitting in another booth, talking to another gorgeous man, whom she introduced as Gabe. Rosaline recognized him as the man Nick had been talking to earlier. After shaking his hand, she turned to Becky. <br/>“Hey, are you ready to call a cab? I would really like to leave.”<br/>Before Becky could answer Gabe interjected “I can put you in the owner’s private car. It will save you some time plus you won’t have to pay cab fare.”<br/>“Oh, we couldn’t . . . “<br/>“We would love too!” Becky exclaimed. When Rosaline started to protest, Becky turned and glared at her.<br/>“Well, alright but only if it’s not too much trouble. I suppose Louis is right.”<br/>Gabe’s only response was a raised eyebrow as he ushered them to the front door, speaking quietly into his cell phone. As she turned to leave Rosaline caught Nick’s eye at the bar and she gave a small wave. She could still feel his eyes on her as she walked through the door.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p>Jenna, 28, has been a sellsword for eight years. Suddenly underemployed due to professional jealousy, Jenna has to face the fact that she has to reinvent herself. Dogged by a suddenly garrulous HeartBlade sword, she accepts a short-term, supposedly easy duty as a caravan guard. Anything to get the sword to shut up.</p>
<p>As they say, no good deed goes unpunished. The caravan master follows the ways of the mountain people of the Bearkin Mountains. When Jenna discovers that the caravan treasures include one kidnapped wizard, she has to make a choice.</p>
<p>Freeing Bellander Quickfingers turns out to be the worst mistake of her life. As she becomes embroiled in the wizard's fight to stay alive, she has to point out to him repeatedly that he might want to give up his pacifist ways. But there's something about this magic man that keeps her by his side. And it's not just the relentless nagging of her sword who seems to think Bell needs saving for some double-edged prophecy fulfillment.</p>
<p>Talking swords and prophecies. Jenna's never been a fan. But now she has to save the man, use the sword and make sure the prophecy plays out for the good of all. Well, at least so her own butt isn't left dead on some battlefield.</p>

<p>This time Gulleh also rode with her. The redhead nodded at her then glanced at her arm. “Who hit you?”</p>
<p>Jenna blinked. Hit her? She followed the track of Jenna’s eyes to her forearm. A red welt was visible. Jenna shrugged. “I spilled coffee on myself. Burned the frak out of me. Got any salve?”</p>
<p>The other woman grunted dismissively. “No. Odd looking burn, that.”</p>
<p>Jenna didn’t respond. The less said the better. She knew it didn’t look like a burn but she couldn’t explain what it was. Not without giving away a lot more than she wanted to share with this guard. She didn’t know any of them that well. Their evening dinners were more about food then music than actual bonding. Jenna liked that just fine. She didn’t have any need to know anyone better.</p>
<p>But she did have a need to know one thing. “So I thought I saw an animal stealing something from the blue wagon.”</p>
<p>Jenna described the creature. Gulleh’s reaction was one of disbelief. “No way you saw that. What you described is a Canna. They are only found up in the Crossfire Mountain range. Too far away for one of them. Maybe you saw a Pariza. They look similar but their tails are tipped in red. Feet too. Anyway, it might have gotten some food. I’ll check later.”</p>
<p>Food wasn’t that heavily guarded. Jenna just let Gulleh tell the lie. It was interesting to note that this Canna wasn’t native here. And she was sure of the coloring. Hadn’t she had her hands on the little one just the day before? Things to think about for sure. She held her tongue letting the ride fall into a silence—even if it wasn’t a companionable one.</p>
<p>The cook’s helper brought breakfast. Jenna unwrapped fried bread slices with jelly on them. There were two sausages as well as some fried vegetables. She was sad to see no coffee, but the cook’s helper assured her he’d bring it back.</p>
<p>“I’m Jabie. I’ll bring you back coffee when I come back for the throw-aways.”</p>
<p>Jenna liked his grin. It split his young face nearly in half making his blond hair dance a bit.</p>
<p>She nodded. “Do that, Jabie. Here. Take this as my thanks.”</p>
<p>Jenna tossed him a coin which he snatched out of the air with ease. “Thank you, ma’am. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Gulleh snorted. “Don’t be handing him money. He gets paid like the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Jenna glanced at her companion. “It’s no hardship. He’s young. I’m sure an extra penny or two to spend won’t go amiss.”</p>
<p>When no response came, Jenna shrugged. She leaned back to eat her food. The comfortable sway of Wind beneath her was a familiar rhythm. To her surprise, the sausages were a familiar spicy flavor. They tasted of her childhood to her. She instantly took a bite of the fried bread and jelly to soothe the burn. With a grin, she tucked the sausage on top of the bread to polish it off. Then she scooped up the vegetables after.</p>
<p>Her satisfied burb got a laugh out of Gulleh. “Well at least you know how to eat. That’s a fact.“</p>
<p>Jenna just nodded. They rode on until the cook’s helper returned with the promised coffee. He also delivered a message that Gulleh was needed by Jorin. She gave a curt nod then urged her mount into a trot. Jenna wasn’t sad to see her leave. Having someone riding by her was nice, but it meant she couldn’t daydream as much. And it meant she couldn’t take longer looks at the blue wagon. Now she moved Wind to the edge of the road. Riding there she could see the wagon three ahead. A rider, Ren from the looks of it, was stationed there.</p>
<p>What was in that wagon?</p>

<p>Mythical creatures (unicorns, dragons, mermaids) are the stuff of legends, bedtime stories parents tell their children. Well they were supposed to be anyway. When a biologist came across a strange egg that looked to be abandoned and took it back to his lab what hatched was something unlike anything he’d ever seen before. It was a baby dragon. Governments and universities started to fund research and expeditions to find more creatures like this dragon. As more mythical beings were captured they started building research facilities to house them. These soon became open to the public and turned into zoos so they could continue to have funding despite how intelligent some of them appeared to be.</p>
<p>Adrian Hwang is a marine biology student trying to finish his last couple of years of college and to do that he had to find an internship. He applied for many around the sea side university town, looking to study sharks. But the only thing he was able to land was more than he’d bargained for. He received and internship working with one of the most notoriously hard to handle creatures at this particular zoo. The mermaids.</p>

To ensure the Anomalies wouldn't hurt any of the regular people while they were roaming around free.

<p>(This is DC Comics, the Earth-3 universe! Inadvertently became Grayson/Todd, with Roy/Jade and background Jokester/Harlequin.)</p>
<p>This is the story of Richard Grayson, a child acrobat whose parents were murdered so he could be taken, and turned into the living weapon of Gotham's king of shadows, Owlman. Renamed under the title 'Talon', Grayson grows up an emotionally shut down killer, and spends years working under his supervillain creator as the enforcer of Owlman's will. However, even as shut down as he is, Grayson is fully aware that the career he's been forced into is one that will kill him before too long. To escape, he aligns with Owlman's greatest nemesis - the Jokester - and uses the hero to fake his own death.</p>
<p>After four years hiding in Metropolis, Grayson gets a call from the Jokester, who's calling in the debt he owes. When he returns to Gotham he comes face to face with the second Talon, a Gotham street rat by the name of Jason Todd. Unwilling to turn away, Grayson helps the Jokester rescue Jason from the same fate he narrowly escaped, at the cost of accidently making Owlman aware that he's still alive.</p>
<p>Now, hiding with the Jokester and his wife, Harlequin, Grayson and Jason are stuck in an unenviable position. One of the most dangerous supervillains in the world, a founding member of the powerful Crime Syndicate, wants them both dead as threats to his reputation, and neither of them have the skills to fight him. They'll have to find someone willing to help two trained killers, as well as figure out who they are to each other, and what they're going to do now that they're in the open.</p>

<p>Ichigo gasps and his eyes fly open, back arching painfully. All he can see is off-white walls bathed in a soft yellow light with no identifiable source, even as he collapses back to what he assumes is an equally off-white floor. He coughs and then heaves several deep breaths as he rolls over to get his arms underneath him.<br/><br/>What the hell? What had that been? There had been the bright white light as Aizen prepared to kill him and then… that.<br/><br/>Seriously, what the fuck?<br/><br/>He’d get the whole watch your life flash before your eyes thing, but that hadn't been anywhere close to his past. That had been a future or… something. He didn't even…<br/><br/>“Kurosaki!”<br/><br/>He startles and whips his head up, eyes focusing on an approaching – and clearly pissed – Aizen. Ichigo jerks up, making it to his knees before the traitor lashes out, grabs a handful of his shinigami uniform, and hauls him up the rest of the way.<br/><br/>“What have you done?” Aizen hisses, brown eyes narrowed and everything about him radiating danger.<br/><br/>Maybe he has no sense of self preservation but he doesn't even think before shoving Aizen away from him, forcing the traitor to release him as he glares right back. “What have I done? That’s my line, bastard! What the hell was that?!”<br/><br/>Enough!<br/><br/>Something sweeps his legs out from under him and sends him crashing to the ground with a yelp, barely catching himself on his arms. He pushes back up to his knees and looks around for the source of the mental shout, noting with no small satisfaction that Aizen is on the ground as well. The room they’re in is fairly small, though the walls seem to blur if he looks at them for too long, and there aren't any visible doors or windows. It also seems to be unoccupied apart from them.<br/><br/>“I’m here.”<br/><br/>He jerks his head around to look in the direction of the voice and immediately wonders how he missed the person standing there the first time. He’s between Aizen and Ichigo’s height and seems to be emitting white light from his very pores, softening every line of his body and making it hard to pin down anything about his appearance. Long hair falls down his back and he’s in some kind of white clothing, though Ichigo can’t tell what it is. Golden eyes are watching him, hard and just barely narrowed, though they flick to Aizen when the traitor stands.<br/><br/>“And you are?” Aizen asks, superiority in each line of his stance and tone.<br/><br/>The person – being – grins, steps closer, and Aizen gives a small sound of frustration as his right leg buckles and he’s forced to one knee. “You can call me God or King, Aizen.”<br/><br/>No way.

My finger is over the hill at 29 and from now there will only be a descent further into aging, with nothing but arthritis to look forward to as it falls into disuse. This is the beginning of the end. My body's decline is heralded by the misfortune of this singular knuckle. It is the literal and figurative turning part. My whole life is this one finger curling awkwardly over a keyboard, hunched too much, like a spine over a desk. Too much bending, too far to turn back now. How to soften the angry gristle? How to knead out the fresh uncertainty of injury? How to drag the gimp finger forward and match the rest of the hand. My hand is a country, this knuckle is in rebellion. How do we come back to the certainly of singular limb, all the parts leading to and feeling one another; complete, implying connection, continuity, body, wholeness; becoming the thing that can grasp a pen, dance on a keyboard, hold up a body, shake other similar things in greeting, smack offenders and pick up or at least stop dropping the things. It's now or never. Flex damn you. Do what you used to do before that fateful meeting with a box and a departure from your regular direction, down where you should have been up, tight when you should have been loose. And now that you've let go of that fitful swelling and gotten back to some kind of normalcy in shape it's time to give up your stiffness and do all the things I expect you to do and without the subtle ache that makes me wonder if your time has come. </p>

<p>It's been five years since Sarana started seeing the future and the past, starting with the witness of their mother's suicide. Five years of hell, of endless nightmares, of waking in the night screaming. Her life is controlled by it. She never knows when she's going to slip into either future or past, the visions crowding into her life, pointless pieces of the past she cannot change, the many futures that could be, that might be, that will be, with no sign as to tell which ones will pass.</p>
<p>Her life is a disjointed revolution of sleeping when she can, being woken by the nightmares, patching her self inflicted wounds, trying to find some sort of balance in her life, helping out around the house, making herself as useful as possible. The time she spends in the forge helps; something about the intensity of her focus there, with the heat and the metal, and her hands shaping steel into useful things, it keeps the visions away for a little while, gives her some respite. The neat ability to sidestep any stray spark, well, that doesn't make up for the horror story the rest of her life is. She knows those with strong powers have difficulty controlling it at first. Five years, and the worst is still to reveal itself to her...</p>
<p>Amidst drowning, she sees the end of the universe. Chaos has poisoned all the worlds, every plane of existence, destroying everything. Seeing the creators, the Great Spirits, dead and decaying, driven to insanity before her own death beside them. Worse, every possibility she sees leads to that end. </p>
<p>Then she sees one. One future among all the endings that might just give the universe a chance. It is uncertain, dangerous, and requires huge sacrifices from her. She will do anything to bring it about, even if she has to betray the family she loves, send others to sacrifice themselves for the barest hope of securing this future. She needs to learn control - and fast, or she will die before she even gets close.</p>

<p>This is an old synopsis, but it still stands up well enough.<br/><br/>The last thing Arin expects is a stalker to follow him on his way home from school. It’s the <br/>catalyst for a siege that leads Arin into another world, haunted by family secrets he knows <br/>little about. While his mother attempts to lure the hunters back to Earth, he is given to his <br/>grandfather, a knight of this world, and assumes a new identity to protect him. As his <br/>fascination with the new world grows, Arin begins to learn the skills that enable him to <br/>protect himself.<br/><br/>On the other side of the country, Princess Sakara is playing at being a good student in an <br/>alternate society, a trade made to secure some desperately needed new political allies, <br/>while her bodyguards in Tiakin fight to find out who is trying to assassinate her. When <br/>Sakara realises that one member of the society is orchestrating a betrayal of the treaty, <br/>she takes what she’s being taught and uses it to plan an escape.<br/><br/>Arin, now Kitari, has just finished his Rei Knight training and spends time in a rebel army <br/>with his cheerfully insane aunt and his grandfather until the orders come: Akira is to take <br/>the Princess back and puts together a team to rescue her, Kitari included by default. <br/>And thus begins the rescue, plagued by demons, escaping the golem scourge, avoiding <br/>the notice of the Shinhan, even fighting the world itself.<br/><br/>It all goes bad.

<p>She probably wasn’t supposed to be outside after dark.<br/>	Caycie slunk around the side of the building and out to the tiny park, which was really nothing more than an island of grass and thick trees surrounded by an asphalt driveway in front of the school. In the center of it was some sort of strange statue. She’d noticed it earlier, when she and her father arrived at the school, and had stopped to study it on one of her many trips to and from the car to unload her stuff. But there was no plaque or anything explaining what it was. It looked vaguely female and possibly Egyptian. Or maybe Greek. It was surrounded by a little paved walkway that led from one side of the park to the other.<br/>	A soft breeze blew around her, disturbing the stray wisps of hair that had escaped her ponytail, making them tickle her face. Caycie brushed them aside, but they refused to stay tucked behind her ears, and she quickly gave up as she stepped onto the pathway, making her way toward the statue.<br/>	Nearby, one of the shrubs rustled. Caycie started, but then she stopped, peering into the darkness, letting her eyes adjust.<br/>	“Kitty?” she called softly. She’d seen several cats hanging out by the statue earlier. When she and her father had checked in with the school’s residence director, the woman had mentioned that the campus was full of cats. They even had a feral cat program, and several teachers and staff members regularly volunteered their time to take care of the animals. Caycie hoped she could do the same. She loved cats, but her father was allergic.<br/>	A small shape slunk out of the bushes and wound around Caycie’s legs. In the dark, Caycie could barely tell that it was a small calico cat.<br/>	“Hey,” she whispered. “Hey, little cat.” She squatted down and held out her hand, and the cat came right up to Caycie, rubbing her face against her outstretched hand. A smile nearly split Caycie’s face in two. “Wow, you’re friendly.”<br/>	Out of the corner of her eye, Caycie saw another shape, this one all black, with bright green eyes that caught the light from some faraway street lamp, glowing a little in the dark. Caycie held her hand out, but the black cat kept his distance, eyeing her but not willing to come forward.<br/>	The calico was purring up a storm, and Caycie used both hands to scratch under the cat’s chin and all the way down her back. She was tiny, and even in the dark, Caycie was able to discern that she had a funny-looking black mark beneath one eye that looked almost like a teardrop. The cat’s face was a little odd-looking, but that only added to her charm. Caycie wanted to scoop her up and cuddle her to her chest.<br/>	Suddenly the cat stiffened. A low, angry sound that was half-growl, half-yowl issued from her mouth, and she arched her back, the hair along her spine and on her tail puffing out like a dish brush. The cat’s eyes fixed on something just beyond Caycie’s left shoulder. Then she opened her mouth and let out a loud hiss.<br/>	Caycie froze, heart hammering in her chest like a staccato drum.<br/>	“You shouldn’t be out here.”<br/>	A loud yelp escaped Caycie’s mouth, and she spun around, leaping backwards as she went, barely managing not to fall over onto the pavement.<br/>	In front of her stood a pale man dressed in black. He stared down at her with a look made all the little hairs on Caycie’s arms stand on end, just like the calico cat’s tail. “Oh my god!” she gasped. “What the hell!” She stood up from her crouch, poised and ready to run.<br/>	“I am John Larrabee,” the man said in a cold, flat voice. “I’m head of security, and it is after seven o’ clock. You should not be outside.”<br/>	“Wh—what?” A stammer was all Caycie could manage as her adrenaline-hyped brain struggled to make sense of his words. “You’re security?”<br/>	“And you are a student who is breaking the rules.”<br/>	Caycie looked him over carefully, her eyes taking in the patch on the right side of his sleeve, the stitching across the front of his crisp, black shirt that read, “Westing School Security.” Below it was a name tag that had ""John Larrabee"" printed on it in white letters.<br/>	“Oh,” she said. She felt something brush between her legs and looked down to see the calico cat, still arching her back and growling at the man.<br/>	“I will escort you back to the front office,” he said.<br/>	“Um, that’s okay,” Caycie said. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know about the rules. I’ll go back inside.” She did not want to be around this creepy man any longer. The cat’s angry noises and the way she refused to take her eyes away from him were unnerving.<br/>	“I will escort you to the front office,” he repeated. His tone allowed no room for argument, and he held his hand out, indicating that she should start walking. Caycie swallowed and forced herself to move.<br/>	He stayed beside her the whole way to the office, and the calico cat followed them, growling and hissing the whole way. Caycie found the noise a little comforting, but she was intensely relieved when she reached the front steps of the main building. She went up them quickly, taking the steps two at a time, but the security guard kept pace with her easily, his movements fluid and sharp. Caycie had the feeling that if she tried to run away from him she wouldn’t get more than a step or two away before he’d catch her.<br/>	She shivered and grabbed the front door handle, ready to yank.<br/>	“The door is locked,” John Larrabee said. He stepped forward and Caycie scooted back, out of his way, as he swiped a key fob over a small reader near the door. The reader’s read light changed to green, and Caycie heard the click of the front doors unlocking. Beside her, the security guard took a step toward the cat, who was sticking close to Caycie’s other side, and made a strange noise not unlike a hiss.<br/>	The cat yowled and backed up, but she didn’t run. Caycie took the opportunity to shove the front door open. The cat made a run for it, but the guard blocked the entrance, and the door fell shut, locking with a soft snicking sound.<br/>	Caycie stopped, realizing that she was breathing too hard, and glanced over at the front office. Some woman she didn’t recognize was sitting at the desk, looking at her through the plexiglass wall with her painted eyebrows raised. Caycie wished she could run past the office, but she didn’t dare. As she turned to go inside, she glanced behind her and almost screamed. John Larrabee was still standing just outside the front door, watching her.</p>

<p>After waiting for what seemed like the longest 12 seconds, the light changed and no cars were anywhere near the crosswalk, so Ori started crossing at a brisk pace. Tray was too busy thinking about how to relate the play to Ori’s life to notice the vehicle before it turned the corner with screeching tires.<br/>    It was over in a flash and the driver didn’t even pause.  He or she simply sped off at more than twice the legal speed limit, leaving smeared tracks on the pavement.  For three very long and surreal seconds Tray couldn’t move, breathe, or even think.<br/>    But after several rounds of blinking, he finally came back to reality.  This reality.  This damn, dirty, disgusting reality.  His legs were like lead as he ran out into the street to land on his knees next to Ori, the puddle of blood surrounding her growing slowly in the sunlight.  <br/>    Oh sweet heavens, she was conscious.  Her eyes were moving slowly back and forth and her mouth was working silent words… she was aware.  He could see in her eyes she knew exactly what was happening and when her eyes finally found his, the look of sheer terror tore his heart apart.<br/>    This wasn’t supposed to happen… not like this.<br/>    The world around them seemed to disappear.  Tray either didn’t notice or didn’t care.  He took Ori’s broken hand in his and gave it a gentle squeeze.  A breathy, barely audible word left her lips as she whispered “...dark….”.<br/>    “I know Ori.  It’s ok.  You just focus on me, ok?  Don’t you dare give up, you’re going to be alright this time, I promise.  Ori look at me.” Her eyes had rolled back slightly and returned to looking at Tray’s face at his command.  The pain, she couldn’t stand the pain.<br/>    Why did it feel familiar?<br/>    Tray watched her for a moment before his face took on a steely expression, seriousness finally overtaking the emotion that had grabbed hold of him in the shock of the accident.  “I’m sorry Ori, I’m so sorry.  I can’t wait anymore.  We have to go now.  There’s no more time.” She saw him pull out what looked like a mirror compact from his back pocket and look into it.  Why was he checking himself out right now?<br/>    Ori’s eyes began to close heavily.  Was he giving her permission to die?  She knew she was dying… she didn’t want to die but it felt so good to just sink into the darkness, like the weight of the world was being lifted from her soul…<br/></p>

<p><strong>FOREWORD</strong> </p>
<p>Greetings, adventurer!</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of Myrillia. This beautiful, majestic land is much unlike your own: wild and untamed, filled with magic and intrigue—and with unfamiliar races. Some of you have already uncovered the record that has become <em>UnBlessed.</em> You might already be familiar with the Melior, a magical race with the capability to manipulate and control the very elements of Myrillia. You may very well remember the other dominant race of the land, the shape-shifting Transeatur. The two races have been enemies for centuries, but the conflict has turned stale. There hasn’t been a battle for a few hundred years, and the two races seem content to pretend the other doesn’t exist. Of course, you scholars already knew that.</p>
<p>While it isn’t necessary to have studied the events of <em>UnBlessed</em>, it could prove useful to find a copy of that tome before starting here. Surely, you would want to know of the terrible choice Kisara Tenebris had to make; after all, her decision will send repercussions throughout Myrillia history. Some of those consequences will be within the pages of this very book. It might interest you to know what exactly it is Lucien Glacies is looking for … then again, it may not.</p>
<p>If you have already discovered the secrets of <em>UnBlessed</em>, then be prepared to delve into an earlier chapter of history—two years earlier, in fact—before Kisara and Lucien’s fateful Blessing ceremony. Get ready to view a completely different side of the Melior with the help of a very special individual …</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE - </strong><strong>Marius</strong></p>
<p>Marius Caleo walked further into the abandoned palace, eyes roaming over the space curiously. This was one of the more ancient grand palaces, possessing multiple dining rooms, public parlors, and a massive ballroom. One of the biggest ballrooms in all of Civitas, in fact. Smirking, he stared around the entrance hall of his new home. Merciful Ignis, it was about time. He’d been waiting for the night of the Blessing Ceremony for far too long; finally, it was over.</p>
<p>It had been frustrating these last few weeks—his parents had practically smothered him, knowing he’d be moving out after the night’s Blessing Ceremony. And why wouldn’t he? Fire Blessings always emerged at the yearly ceremony, especially if the bloodline was undiluted with other Blessings. Not only was he the son of the current Council Leader, but he was descended from generations of pure Fire unions. It was obvious that he would be Fire Blessed, obvious and expected.</p>
<p>Granted, what had <em>not</em> been expected was the strength of his Blessing. Why, the flames at the Fire Shrine had practically leapt to the ceiling when Marius approached.</p>
<p>He chuckled to himself as he sauntered through the entrance hall, remembering the startled shrieks the sudden blaze caused—and the astonished look the Elder Priest tossed his way after the flames returned to normal. Marius wasn’t sure if the priest’s astonished look had been for the blaze or for his unusual Elemental markings.</p>

<p>Kisara Tenebris is a Melior: one of the elemental magic users that populate the world of Myrillia. Every aspect of Melior life is dictated by their Blessing, or ability, with the rarest and most powerful earning a spot on the ruling council.</p>
<p>Kisara dreams of the day she’ll receive her own Blessing and take her place among society. But when she’s unBlessed year after year, left behind by her friends – and the boy she loves – she can’t help but wonder what she did wrong.</p>
<p>Instead, Kisara must discover that magic doesn’t determine one’s worth – and that she doesn’t have to be like everyone else to be accepted.</p>
<p>After all, the Elements have greater things planned for Kisara.</p>

<p>Magic coated the fabric of the newly delivered Blessing dress, the colors dancing through a rainbow of shades. Kisara Tenebris trailed a quivering finger along the hem and admired the play of magic.</p>
<p>Tonight was the night.</p>
<p>The yearly Blessing Ceremony would be held tonight, and it was finally <em>her</em> turn to join the youths at the Great Temple. Her turn to stand before the Elements and receive one of their Blessings. She might even become Favored—one of the elite that lived in the palaces at city center and guided the entire Melior population!</p>
<p>Unable to contain her excitement any longer, Kisara shrieked and bounced around her room, careful to avoid jostling her new gown. To think, after thirteen years she would finally become an adult!</p>
<p>“Kisara, what in the name of the Elements are you doing?”</p>
<p>Cheeks flushed with exertion, Kisara whirled to beam at her mother. “Oh, nothing. Just celebrating.” She rushed to her gown and held it out for the other to admire. “Look, did you see? My gown arrived! Isn’t it beautiful?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s quite lovely, isn’t it?” Her mother smiled indulgently. “I assume you like it? I told the seamstress to make it a little old fashioned, with the flowing skirts and lace sleeves, rather than the short tunic styles so popular with girls these days. I thought you’d look very elegant and grown up in it.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, it’s absolutely perfect! I can’t wait for this evening!” Kisara couldn’t help the little dance of joy that accompanied the statement. “Do you think it would be okay if I tried it on? Just to make sure it fits. I promise I’ll take it off right away!”</p>
<p>Laughing, her mother replied, “No you won’t. I know you better than that. Once you have it on, you’ll make up some excuse that will prevent you from having to take it off again.” She ruffled Kisara’s hair and suggested, “No, why don’t you go visit your friends instead? Take your time; have them show you their Blessing clothes. You can even bring them back to show them yours, as long as it stays on the rack.”</p>
<p>Kisara scrunched up her face in disappointment.</p>
<p>Her mother snapped her fingers suddenly, her brow furrowed with concern. “You know, maybe we should go check on Lucien. I ran into his mother at the market, and she told me he’s extremely nervous about tonight. Maera  wondered if the two of you should stay behind a year, especially since you’re both so close to the cutoff date.”</p>
<p>Immediately distracted, Kisara stared at her mother with horror. “Stay behind?! Both of us? But, but you already got my Blessing gown!”</p>
<p>“True, but it will keep a year.”</p>
<p>“A year?! Uh, why don’t I go talk to Lucien first? I mean, we already agreed to attend this year. Our names are on the register and everything. I’ll, uh. I’ll be right back.” Kisara rushed from the room, heedless of her mother’s suppressed amusement.</p>

<p> A young man graduates from college and lands a job as a personal assistant to one of Young Hollywood's hottest British imports.</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/movieye/novels/wish-upon-a-star-928170/stats,November 2015,"
<p> </p>
<p>Twelve months ago, I was in my last year of college in Toronto, expecting to graduate with a Communications degree. I thought my future was going to be in the diplomatic corps and I dreamed of working in an African or Tahitian embassy – definitely somewhere tropical – proudly representing Queen and country for Canada, stamping passports or handing out travel brochures. Maybe I could work as a spy, I thought. But after a couple embassy bombings and hostage-takings, I changed my mind and found myself listening eagerly instead to a friend’s older sister who worked for a huge P.R. company in Hollywood and was back in Toronto for the film festival.</p>
<p>Party-party-party, party-party-party! That was how Lisa described her job. She went to film festivals around the world, watched movies, did ‘lunch’ with journalists, slept with the occasional celebrity and party-party-party.</p>
<p>Well <em>I</em> wanted that job. So after much begging and a weekend of stuffing press kits for her, she gave me a name, a number and an e-mail address.</p>
<p>“It’s not what you know, it’s who you know. Ask for Joanne Baum at Results 360. Tell her Lisa Nichols sent you. She’ll get you a job.”</p>
<p>The remaining months of school were a blur. I e-mailed Joanne Baum and she asked for my resume. She seemed particularly interested in a cooking diploma I had earned one summer term when I thought I wanted to be a chef. When would I be in L.A., she asked? I told her I could be in Los Angeles that summer.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>The Results 360 Management Company was located on a busy corner in Santa Monica. I arrived at their small glass office building on Colorado Avenue and parked in its dark dungeon of underground parking. When I walked out of the elevator, I saw a lineup in the lobby of fashionable young women dressed in tailored and tapered suits with no blouses for maximum cleavage. I stood there and stared. Clothed in standard Internet-geek interview gear – casual shirt and pants, boat shoes, a baggy Banana Republic jacket - I felt I was back at a high school dance, standing in the corner of the gym with my ‘smart’ friends while the glamorous girls sized up the Neanderthals in the football team. Surely a celebrity would want one of these gorgeous eye candy accessories as a publicist, not someone like me. I took a deep breath and joined the line.</p>
<p>In the reception area, a Jessie J. look-alike with heavy eyeliner, short black hair and assorted facial piercings, handed me a translucent clipboard with an application form and a pen. I had an appointment to see Joanne Baum, I insisted, but she pointed at the clipboard and waved me off. I took a seat and began what I believed was an exercise in futility. As I dejectedly filled out the form, I sensed someone watching me. I looked up and met the green eyes of a carrot-top redhead Tori Amos clone with freckles and glasses clutching her own clipboard. I’d always thought that Tori Amos looked like Pippi Longstocking all grown up. I nodded at her. She smiled, nodded back and walked over to sit next to me.</p>
<p>“I’m Nancy.”</p>
<p>“Hi, I’m James.”</p>
<p>“Applying to be an intern?”</p>
<p>“Actually, I was applying for a publicist job.”</p>
<p>“Great. I’m here for my third interview. To work for an actress!”</p>
<p>“Cool.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got a great accent. Where are you from?”</p>
<p>“Canada.” I didn’t think I had an accent.</p>
<p>“No way! My grandmother’s from Canada! But you look Chinese.”</p>
<p>“I am. I’m Chinese-Canadian.”</p>
<p>“Nancy? They’re ready to see you now,” the receptionist droned.</p>
<p>“Okay!” She got up to go, paused, then wrote something on her clipboard and handed it to me. “Well, Mr. James, good luck! Here’s my number – call me!”</p>
<p>“Oh! Sure. Good luck to you too!” I sat back and grinned like an idiot. My day had brightened considerably.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Forty-five excruciating minutes later, the receptionist showed me into a plain white room with bare walls, a white table, and two metal stools. Minimalist chic. On one stool sat Joanne Baum, an unsmiling efficient-looking female Clark Kent complete with severe short hair and heavy tortoise-shell glasses. She didn’t look a thing like her friendly emails, which were always full of career advice and quips about the L.A. weather. Behind her on the wall was an all-too-obvious two-way mirror. I sat across from her. She was reviewing my application form. I had an impulse to cross and uncross my legs à la Sharon Stone.</p>
<p>“James Lee. Age 24.” murmured Ms. Baum without looking up.</p>
<p>“Yes, James. That’s right.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. Communications degree from the University of Toronto, Canada. You’ve never worked as a publicist?” Her pen tapped the clipboard impatiently.</p>
<p>“Well, I worked with publicists back in school when I wrote for the school paper. I was the music editor and I reviewed new releases. I also ran the student web site for the Communications department and wrote press releases for my psych professor.” I smiled at her and at the mirror.</p>
<p>“Hmmm. Oh, you’re that friend of Lisa Nichols.” Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>“Yes, I enjoyed your e-mails.”</p>
<p>“Right, that was you.” She flipped a page. “You also went to cooking school?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can cook Cantonese, Shanghai style as well as Jamaican.”</p>
<p>“Jamaican?” The pen paused mid-air.</p>
<p>“Yes, Canada has a large Jamaican population. The food is popular in Toronto.”</p>
<p>“That’s interesting,” Ms. Baum said disinterestedly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I nodded. “Um, are you looking for a chef or a publicist?”</p>
<p>“Well, James, I am looking for a special person. A personal publicist who can deal with a problem child. And if you can cook the occasional meal, that’s a great advantage. You know the old saying, ‘the way to the heart is through the stomach.’ You’re looking for your first job. I hope you’re flexible.” She was staring at me now.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course,” I said weakly. I looked at the mirror and smiled ingratiatingly. Problem child, I wondered.</p>
<p>Ms. Baum was looking at her clipboard again.</p>
<p>“Now <em>this</em> is interesting.” She picked up her pen and her eyes showed their first sign of life. “You were born in England?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my parents went to school in London. I suppose I was their graduation present.” I began to chuckle but immediately fell silent under the gravity of her gaze.</p>
<p>“But,” Ms. Baum’s voice was clipped, “You’re Chinese, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I hoped that was the right answer. “I’m of Chinese descent.”</p>
<p>Her face lit up with a smile. “Hey, did you see <em>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</em>?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did!” I almost cried with relief.</p>
<p>“Great movie!” she winked at me, “Just amazing!”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Thank you very much, I wrote it myself.</p>
<p>“Hmmm. Chinese. Born in England, educated in Canada. Green card with British and Canadian passports? That’s great. What do your parents do?” She leaned towards me and smiled again. I hadn’t realized how many teeth she had.</p>
<p>“My dad’s a professor. My mother is a librarian.”</p>
<p>“Professional people!” She paused and regarded me closely. I swallowed. “Wait one second. I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>Ms. Baum glided out of the room. I sat silently, occasionally smiling at the mirror. A few minutes passed. Suddenly the door flew open and Ms. Baum strode in with an extraordinarily tall and imposing older gentleman. At first glance I thought it was John Lithgow, the actor who had played the High Commander father from <em>Third Rock From the Sun</em>. Cool! I leapt up to shake his hand. An enormous smile spread across his face. He opened his mouth and a bass-baritone boomed out in a rich, theatrical English accent.</p>
<p>“Hullo-hullo! I’m Andrew Mills! Delighted to meet you, James! Delighted! And apparently a <em>fellow</em> Englishman, I see!” He rolled his head back and laughed thunderously.</p>
<p>No, I thought, he’s much louder than John Lithgow.</p>
<p>Ms. Baum tittered, holding her clipboard to her chest. I smiled.</p>
<p>“You are Chinese, James?” He was still shaking my hand.</p>
<p>“Yes, my parents are from Hong Kong but I grew up in Canada.”</p>
<p>“Noble people, the Chinese! Noble! Hong Kong is an extraordinary place! Honor and integrity abound in your culture and heritage! Be proud! Be <em>very</em> proud!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>
<p>I noticed that Ms. Baum was beaming.</p>
<p>Andrew Mills finally let go of my hand and pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket.</p>
<p>“James, this is our address. We would be delighted if you’d come by the house tomorrow to meet my son. I think you are the ideal candidate! A godsend! A <em>Chinese</em> Englishman!”</p>
<p>I stared at the slip of paper he had handed me. “Sure, I’ll be there.” We shook hands again. His hands were big and soft. They trembled slightly.</p>
<p>With a tip of an imaginary hat, Mr. Mills stepped out of the room and Ms. Baum turned to me with palpable delight.</p>
<p>“You are the <em>first</em> person they’ve ever wanted to see at the house!”</p>
<p>“What does Andrew Mills do? And who’s his son?” I was disappointed that Mr. Mills hadn’t turned out to be John Lithgow and still a bit shaken from his dramatic entrance and exit.</p>
<p>“He’s <em>Brandon </em>Mills’ father.”</p>
<p>“Brandon Mills?”</p>
<p>“The actor?”</p>
<p>“Brandon Mills?” I was drawing a blank.</p>
<p>Ms. Baum’s smile melted away. “Brandon Mills? The <em>English</em> actor? He was the star of <em>War Song?”</em> She had begun tapping her clipboard again. It was like a warning rattle from a snake.</p>
<p>I stared at her for a moment as recognition dawned on me. <em>War Song</em>! The weepy World War II Christmas drama – the perennial holiday classic! He was that little blond boy with the curly hair who had co-starred with a collie - or was it a Jack Russell? Who could forget that little face when he begged the commandant, “Please sir, not <em>my</em> dog.”? The best part of the movie was when he sang ‘O Tannenbaum’ until the Germans surrendered. My eyes welled at the memory. His performance was as memorable as Jamie Bell’s in <em>Billy Elliot</em> and as Haley Joel Osment’s in <em>The Sixth Sense</em>. Brandon had been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar and I remember everyone thought he had been cheated when he didn’t win. He was simply too young to win a Best Actor statuette, most people decided. See what he’ll do in a few years.</p>
<p>I think the dog trainer got a special Oscar, though. </p>

<p>CHARLIE KENTER is a 15 year old boy with a lot on his mind. He’s in foster care, he’s been sexually abused, and his therapist isn’t particularly helpful in understanding his nightmares. Living in Los Angeles, Charlie dreams nightly about earthquakes (especially the Big One), zombies, alien invasions and armed intruders invading his school. He clings to the hope that he’ll get a family of his own.<br/><br/>His caseworker LINDA introduces him to MICHAEL CHAN, a middle-aged Chinese American who wants to adopt as a single father. Though this is not the family unit Charlie had dreamed of, he soon acclimatizes to a trans-racial adoption and is happy to reboot his life with Michael, his beloved 12-year old dachshund, his conservative Tiger parents who’re eager to teach him about Chinese food and culture, and his goofy best friend, FRANKIE.<br/><br/>However a month after the adoption is finalized, Michael is relocated to Austin for a new job. The just forming father and son bonds are uprooted and tested in a strange new world called Texas. Michael rents a house with a pool, eager to make a new home for them.

<p><br/>“Are you still having bad dreams, Charlie?”<br/><br/>Today I’m playing a new game with my therapist, Ms. Wendy.  I’m wearing shorts even though it’s cool out for March. Even for L.A.  But I’m freeballing because my foster mom didn’t have time to finish the laundry over the weekend, so I’m sitting, bouncing my knees and crossing my legs to see if Ms. Wendy will notice.  It’s not that anything is showing – these are, like, board shorts – but I want to see if she’s pervy enough to look.<br/><br/>Ms. Wendy never asks me how I feel.  She just wants to know, yes or no, am I still having bad dreams, what are they about, and then she’ll make notes in her notebook.  One time when she got up to refill her brown mug (“Therapists Do It Thoughtfully”) from the water cooler down the hall, I sneaked a look at her notebook and all she wrote was “persistent nightmares” and “uncommunicative.”  She had underlined “uncommunicative.”  I know I don’t talk much; I don’t have much to say to her.<br/><br/>“Charlie? Bad dreams?” She’s so annoying.<br/>“I guess so.”  I cross my arms so I can scratch my elbows, and just sit and look around her drab office.<br/>I see Ms. Wendy once a week which is fine with me.  It gets me out of school for an afternoon.  I wish she had one of those psychiatrist couches you can lie down on like you see on TV, but instead I’m fidgeting in this large wooden chair with a footrest across from her desk in her dimly lit room while she sits facing her laptop which has her calendar and emails up and I feel like I’m an interruption in her busy and very important day.  Her eyes are always focused on her notebook.  The computer monitor’s reflection on her glasses sort of makes her face look like a weird Halloween mask with glowing eyes.  She keeps scribbling down notes that I just know will get me in trouble with my caseworker.<br/>I know how things work.  I just turned fifteen but I know if I say too much to Ms. Wendy, her notes will screw up my future.  And the more notes she makes means the more she’ll be blabbing to my caseworker, and the fewer chances I’ll have to get adopted.<br/>Ms. Wendy’s desk is surrounded by massive wooden bookshelves and her wall of degrees and certificates. It’s stuffy in here. Her office has this stupid brown ceiling fan, which turns very slowly like the second-hand on her wall clock.  What good is a ceiling fan that doesn’t go faster?  I’ve got to put up with this for forty-five minutes.  I’d much rather check out the miniature doll house sitting on the floor or play with the Viking chess set or even the colored blocks than say too much to her.  I could even put on a freak show with her anatomically correct Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls but she’d chew me out and scribble more notes.<br/>I hate Ms. Wendy.  I know it’s not good to hate people, but she represents the System, and I don’t have a problem hating the System.<br/>Ms. Wendy has drawn-in eyebrows that make her face look not quite real, like a Chucky doll.  She always wears black to camouflage her fatitude but it only makes her resemble a big black bear balancing on a stool.  She ends our sessions exactly at forty-five minutes, even if I’m in the middle of trying to tell her something important.  I’m just a checkmark in her calendar:  “Appointment with Charlie Kenter.” So we both are clock watchers.  I think I’ve hated her ever since the first time I saw her drive into the clinic parking lot in a royal blue BMW 535—all the kids at school say that people who drive BMWs are douches and they’re right.<br/>I miss my old therapist, Ms. Beverly, who was always so eager to listen to me or play stupid (okay, they were sort of fun) board games with me that she sometimes lost track of the time or forgot to write anything at all in her notepad.  I liked Ms. Beverly a lot.  She was someone I could talk to about my worrying, my nightmares.  She taught me relaxation techniques, breathing tricks with a paper bag—they help me when I’m having anxiety attacks.  I thought she cared. Unfortunately, one afternoon I told her that I loved her and she calmly put down her pencil and told me that it was inappropriate for a boy to become overly attached to his therapist.  She referred me to Ms. Wendy the next week. Just like that, she didn’t want to see me anymore.  <br/>I didn’t mean “love” like in “I want to go out with you;” I meant that she was like a mom to me.<br/>Ms. Wendy is still taking notes, her eyes occasionally darting at me over the rim of her glasses.  Her pencil is practically tearing into the paper. I’m wondering what she’s writing when I’m not even saying anything.  My ass cheeks are itchy and falling asleep so I keep shifting in the chair.<br/>“Can you tell me about your most recent dream, Charlie?”  Ms. Wendy sounds bored. <br/>“I dunno.”<br/>“Your foster mom says that she hears you getting up in the middle of the night.  Are you still worried about earthquakes?”<br/>Finally I go, “I have dreams all the time. Some are nightmares. Like anyone else, right?”<br/>“Still having nightmares,” she says to herself as she makes a note.<br/>Ms. Wendy knows how bad my dreams can be.  They’re in my file in TMI detail.  She knows all about my recurring nightmares: the ones where the Big One, the great earthquake, was destroying L.A., and I had no family to run to.  No family to save me. Those nightmares were so real, so scary, I’d have to force myself to wake up, first thinking I’m covered in blood, then realizing it’s just sweat dripping from my face.<br/>I’ve been in and out of foster care for almost five years, so I’ve developed my own checklist to make sure I get adopted.  Number one is be clean; potential parents always sniff for B.O., and see dirty clothes or fingernails or hair as problem areas.  Number two, don’t swear; say “shit” or “fuck” in front of someone and they’ll choose another kid.  Lucky for me, I had no problem with number three: don’t be a Damien.  Seriously, boys named Damien never get adopted.  My caseworker, Linda, told me that “Damien” was the name of an adopted kid from an old horror movie I had never seen (not that I ever watch horror movies anyway).  And number four, don’t talk about your nightmares.  I couldn’t have anyone thinking that I was nuts.  It didn’t help that I knew my file must have lots of notes about my nightmares.<br/>The main thing against me was my age.  We’re like the dogs at the rescue shelter.  Everyone wants the puppies—the cute and cuddly babies—and then the cute and wobbly toddlers.  No one wants a fifteen-year old dog (or kid) because they’re afraid we’re too old, we’re troubled, probably damaged beyond repair. We have “issues.” And in a couple years, we hit eighteen and the System bails on us.<br/>A couple months ago, I had to do one of those Wednesday’s Child videos for the local TV station.  That’s where once a year each foster kid gets a whole sixty seconds of television time to beg for a home, but of course you can watch that Sarah McLachlan commercial for kittens and puppies for hours late at night, every night.  I know because when I can’t sleep, I sometimes watch TV and that’s all that’s on.  If you ask me, people worry more about dogs and cats than they do about kids.<br/>On my Wednesday’s Child video, I said that I’m a pretty cool kid, that I’m a good person and you just have to get to know me.  I’d love to have a mom and dad and a brother. Oh, and I really want to have my own bedroom someday.  I’ve had to share a bedroom in every placement.  My current roomie, Bryan (or is it Ryan?), is a year older than me, doesn’t bathe or use deodorant, grunts in his sleep, and is starting to grow a beard.  It’s like rooming with a goat.<br/>Everything I own fits in one duffel bag. I like Converse shoes, flip-flops and I like wearing big baggy t-shirts – whatever Goodwill or the nearest church has.  I have my ‘soup shirt’ which is a humongous black t-shirt that I wear if I’m eating soup or spaghetti. On my right wrist, I wear maybe five different color wristbands for maybe five different charities and causes that everyone at school supports (of course we all threw away the yellow one).<br/>I didn’t really think much about my looks until after the Incident last year.  I know I am skinny (but it does make my abs show up naturally).  I seriously need a tan, and with my dark hair and bushy slashed eyebrows and the shadows under my eyes from lack of sleep, people keep thinking I’m emo or walking dead.  Most guess I’m older because I used to smoke so I have a raspy voice.  I don’t like people staring at me. I don’t like to be laughed at.  And, after the Incident, I’m always afraid people don’t respect me, thinking that I’m some lowlife.  Ms. Wendy and my caseworker, Linda, are always telling me that I need to improve my communication skills.  “Smile more, Dimples!” Linda likes to say.  But my mouth is sort of crooked after an accident I had when I was a kid (stitches, damaged nerve endings), and I’m really self-conscious because of my chipped front tooth.  I hate dentists.<br/>The Incident.  If I could erase that from my file and start over again.  See, my mom dated some really terrible guys over the years.  A couple of them beat on me because they were drunk or tweaking and I was pissing them off somehow.  One guy picked me up and smashed me into the wall.  Another guy threw me into a Dumpster, calling me a failed abortion, a piece of shit.  That time the neighbors called the police.  The police brought in Child Services.  And Child Services freaked when they found out that my mom, Julia, was using her walk-in closet for my bedroom.  My mom told them that she couldn’t afford a two-bedroom apartment working as a waitress and also as an attendant at a twenty-four-hour gas station in Venice.  After that, she lied to Child Services and told them that I slept in the bedroom while she slept on the couch in the living room.<br/>But it was the Incident that really screwed over my life.  Last year at the apartment complex where I was living with my mom, two drunk women were hanging out one night in the community Jacuzzi in the corner of our building’s courtyard.  They were tourists from Europe visiting a friend; they didn’t even live in the building.  They saw me, waved a big bottle of booze and told me to come over and join them.  Somebody called the police just as I was having the best time of my life.  Next thing I know, there’s an article in the Culver City Patch.  And that leads to a bigger article in the L.A. Times about the two women getting charged for “unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor” and “unlawful oral copulation with a minor.”  My mom finally lost her parental rights because she was out on a date that night and she didn’t pick me up from the police station until the next morning.<br/>The funny thing about the Incident is that I think it literally made me grow faster.  I used to be shorter than all the guys in my class, but since the Incident, I’ve been getting taller and leaving shoe sizes behind like crazy so I hope I’m going to be over six feet.  Ms. Linda calls it a “growth spurt” and I want to say something rude to her about “spurting” because I did so much of it that night, but I know better than to talk about the Incident to Linda because she always makes a pity face and tells me I’m a brave young victim of abuse.<br/>“Charlie,” Ms. Wendy says, “Are you’re still worrying about earthquakes? School shootings?”  She flips back a couple pages in her notebook. “Uh, zombies? Terrorists? Alien invasions?”  She’s trying to suppress a smile like she wants to laugh at me.<br/>“I guess so.”  I keep squirming in the chair to find a comfortable position.<br/>“You’ve started the intruder training at school?” she asks.<br/>“Yeah, we have it every two weeks.”  Thanks for reminding me, Ms. Wendy. “We’re doing the ADD survival training thing.”  I repeat what we were taught.  “AVOID the intruder by running away.  DENY the intruder access by locking doors behind you and hiding in utility rooms and closets.  And if all else fails, DEFEND yourself.”<br/>“See? That’s good, Charlie.  ADD is supposed to give you confidence so you’ll know what to do.”<br/>It’s also adding to things I worry about. “We have the monthly earthquake and tsunami preparedness drills, too, because our teachers say that the Big One is definitely coming.  It’s a matter of math and they say the odds increase every day.”<br/>Ms. Wendy scrunches up her nose likes she smells a fart (not me). “Well, that’s not helpful, is it?”  She shakes her head. “The training is preparedness. So you won’t be surprised.  Humans have a fight-or-flight-or-freeze mechanism. And what that means is that if you’re faced with a dangerous situation, you can react quickly.  Some people freeze up – and that can be fatal in a dangerous situation.”<br/>I press on, “I noticed the security guards at school now all have guns—no more Tasers.”  Every time we heard about a shooting at another school, I just kept thinking that a major disaster was just around the corner.  Any day now.  I could feel it.  I could see it in my nightmares.<br/>“Preparedness, Charlie.  That’s a good thing.  You can’t keep worrying about earthquakes and natural disasters and terrorists and things beyond your control.  Learn to relax and accept each day as it comes.”  Ms. Wendy is looking at me.  I look up at the clock.  We’re almost done for today.  <br/>I’m not sure what to say. You can’t tell a worrier not to worry and expect him to stop worrying, just like that.  I’m sitting up, hugging my knees to my chest.  It’s the only position that stops my ass cheeks from falling asleep.<br/>“Well, Charlie. I hope you’re sleeping better.” Ms. Wendy makes more notes.  “I’m going to let your caseworker know that you’re still having nightmares.”<br/>“Okay.”  I get up to leave. My back is sore from all the sitting.<br/>“Oh, Charlie?”  Ms. Wendy doesn’t even look up from her laptop.  “Do you take Latin at school?”<br/>“What?  No.” Seriously, Latin?<br/>She swivels to look at me. “Here’s a fun phrase for you to remember. Semper Ubi Sub Ubi. Always wear underwear.”<br/>My face goes beet red. I want to key her car.<br/>“Don’t worry so much, Charlie.  Have a good week.”  Then she turns back to her desk while I stumble out the door.<br/></p>

<p>Jack walked along the muddy shore of Grand Isle, Louisiana. This was a daily walk for him.  Seeing the muddy gulf somehow gave him a sense of peace and calm. He could see a few shrimping and fishing boats, but it was otherwise quiet on this Sunday morning. Up ahead he saw a few kids gathered around what looked to be a water drenched log that had washed up on shore. Only their reactions of “oooh” and “ahhhh” seemed rather peculiar for just another log. Jack walked closer to the gathering crowd of kids to find out what was going on. “Hey old man, what are you doing here?! We found this first” said one of the young boys. Jack pushed the young boy aside and looked at the “log”. Only, it was no log. It was a body. A bloated, 75 yr old body. Jack gasped in horror when he looked closer. This was no random body.  Jack knew the man all too well. And as the stench rose from the rotting corpse, so did his fear of losing what family he had left. Jack slowly pulled out his cell phone and waited for a miracle to show up.</p>

<p>Naomi sat in the middle of the rain-soaked street looking dead head. Her dark brown hair messily flowing in the wind. Her blue eyes pierced the metallic sheen from the oncoming cars. They were no match for her. She was wearing a bleach white hazmat suit, complete with yellow protective sleeves for her shoes. On the back of the suit, in dark black letters the numbers 4320009 were stamped, with the words BIOHAZARD: DO NOT APPROACH below the stamp. Naomi has been forced to wear that suit for the past 21 days. Her body reeked of sorrow and dirty flesh. She was a target now, and the government made damn sure everyone knew it. Within those past 21 days, her fiancé dumped her, her family was quarrentined and blamed her for it instead of being supportive, and she was fired from her job. She sat in the middle of the street, letting the rain soak through the thick plastic shield she was in. An oncoming car approached her at a high rate of speed. Those piercing blue eyes met the headlights of the car. The metal and flesh combined on the pavement in slow moving sorrow. </p>

<p>You could smell it nearly a mile away. That familiar chemical smell that hangs in the air around this time each year. So familiar in fact that people barely notice it anymore. To them,the putrid smell has become a ""tradition"" just like everything else. They weren't worried about breathing it in either. After all, it wasn't nearly half as bad as the shit that was already being pumped into the air by the chemical plants less than 12 miles away. <br/><br/>""Pass me another can, we are out of snow!"" yelled Timmy Gunderson at his younger brother, Ansley<br/>""Go get it yourself, lazyass!"" replied Ansley<br/><br/>Timmy Gunderson groaned as he climbed down the ladder.

He walked over to ansley's car and unplugged the ipod speakers. Timmy was walking away when he suddenly felt a nasty sting on his eye.

<p>Agatha and Abigail MacEwan were 12 years old. They lived with their mom, Elaine, and their Grandma.

<p>Aggie sighed in frustration. She and Abby were always going back and forth like that. Aggie, the older of the two by about three minutes, felt like she was years older than Abby, who was more adventurous. Abby was getting into trouble all the time because she wouldn't follow rules and, according to Aggie, without rules, well, everyone would just be in trouble, which they almost always were. </p>
<p>As the girls were putting away their backpacks, their friend, Justin, sauntered up. According to Aggie, Justin thought he was a ladies' man; they didn't know what a ladies' man was, but Aggie was certain he thought he was one. Abby just thought he was funny, mostly because he was always up for adventure.</p>

Yet, the gifts have gone from flattering to creepy all while still being perfectly nice, it makes not sense. She can't shake the feeling of being watched and that her house, her car, and just her things are being messed with. Like nothing is missing but there not right.... it sounds crazy just talking about it. </p><p>Is the threat real or imagined? Emmy is about to find out that while few stalkers escalate to violence, the ones who do rarely stop.  In this case, who you don't know, really CAN hurt you. </p><p>(For the record I hate this synopsis and will edit it later)</p>

<p>Church Hill</p>
<p>Richmond, Virginia</p>
<p>June 15, 2025</p>
<p>4:00 pm</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to scream, to fill the room with my anguish, but for her sake I don't. She wouldn't want me to make a scene. Instead I sit in the back of the room, away from the other mourners, in an ill-fitting black dress that I borrowed at the last minute. I've never been a details person. So when my best friend told me she was dying I didn't think to plan out what to wear for her funeral. Funeral. Am I really here in this garish room with rust colored carpet and wood paneling? She doesn't belong here in this dark cave. I want to pick up her lifeless body and animate her into the woman she’d been, but would never be again.</p>
<p>For as long as I had known her, she had worn the millstone of grief around her neck like a family heirloom. Grief and loss were all she knew. She didn't believe in love, joy or happiness any more than I do. We were alike that way. The only difference was that she accepted it and kept going. She didn't rage against her fate or lament it like I do.</p>
<p>She came into my life when I needed a friend the most. Her friendship saved me from myself. She, and the glimmer of hope she had brought out in me, became the very foundation I stood upon. Now, without her, I feel as though I should have crumbled, fallen back into the abyss. I can't understand why I’m still here, and she’s not. I'm left behind, again, alone with my grief and painful memories.</p>
<p>Maybe I should start smoking. I think about it often these days, but no one takes up smoking in their late 40's. Out of habit, I find myself checking my phone for the time. The service was supposed to have started 20 minutes ago. People are sitting in groups quietly chatting, remembering. I know most of them, but the majority of them don't know me.</p>
<p>You see, she’d been a vivid storyteller, prodigious with her correspondences after I moved away and our regular sessions stopped. She had lived a life filled with one tragedy after another. During her weekly sessions, and then later in her phone calls and letters, she would artfully lay out each tragic landscape, stacking them one on top of the other, a veritable Lincoln Log house of horrors.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the evocative imagery in which she used to tell her life stories would leave me awake at night bringing home for me the experience of secondary trauma.</p>
<p>As her therapist, I had crossed some very basic ethical boundaries by taking her on as a client and then later by becoming friends with her. Our shared experience of having lost a child bound us together in a spiraling transference that should have caused me to lose my license forever. Just the thought of those early days brings all the pain up anew, and I find myself touching my stomach – another empty vessel.</p>
<p>The sound of mournful music playing out of old speakers in the front of the room brings me out of my past and into the present—the service has finally started. The minister is talking, but I can’t hear a word he is saying. Seeing her lying stiffly in the oak casket with a waxy, yellowed pallor makes it hard for me to breathe. My heart is racing, my breath is coming in short gasps, and the room suddenly feels like it’s closing in on me. I need to get out of this cave, this tomb, before it consumes me. I make a beeline to the exit right behind me and the heavy wooden doors give easily as I push them out.</p>
<p>The cool spring air immediately stings my burning flesh, and my wobbly legs implore me to sit down on the funeral home's stone steps. As I sit down my heart rate begins to slow, and my vision returns to normal. The panic attack abates. From my seat at the top of a hill the city is spread out before me, a barren, lifeless landscape, a ramshackle Centre of yesteryear—ruin porn. Death is everywhere here following me around like a persistent black cloud.</p>
<p>So steeped in grief and self-pity, I don't hear the door open behind me or him coming down the steps towards me. I jump when he speaks my name in his deep baritone voice and the tips of his fingers brush my bare shoulder. “Ellie?” I look up at him and the skin on my chest and arms prickles and my heart skips a beat. His deep brown eyes capture mine and his smile deepens as he speaks it again. “Ellie.”</p>
<p>A smile, curved inside book-ended parentheses, greets me. In one swift motion he removes his hat and unbuttons his jacket before lowering his large frame beside me. He’s aged but his smile and intense gaze, and the effect they have on me, are the same. Time slows almost to the point of stopping, expanding to envelop us in this moment. I somehow regain control of my vocal cords and acknowledge him in a half question, half proclamation. “Christopher.”</p>
<p>Just saying his name awakens my senses. I feel my face flush, and I look away from him. His rounded shoulders playfully tap against mine. He had once been my respite, my port of call from the storms of life. My heart is heavy with grief and I long to burrow inside his embrace; cleave to him, like I had so many times before. I no longer had that right though. I’d walked away, I remind myself.</p>
<p>How is this possible? Why now? My brain is in hyperdrive trying to process this odd happenstance.</p>
<p>“Are you really here?”</p>
<p>“In the flesh,” he replies.</p>
<p>As if to reassure me of his true presence, he takes my hand and brings it to his lips. Sometimes seventeen years can feel like a breath away. He nods his head towards the doors.</p>
<p>“My mother passed away.”</p>
<p>His news constricts my already grieving heart. “I'm sorry.”</p>
<p>For the first time since he spoke my name he turns away from me hiding his pained expression.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he says with a long exhale.</p>
<p>His grip on my hand tightens as he clears his throat. “Today was the viewing, or whatever it is they call it.”</p>
<p>In that moment I remember seeing the other family across the hall. I close my eyes and try to remember what she had looked like, the sound of her voice, and the smell of her kitchen. He brings our clasped hands back up to his mouth, just brushing his lips against my fingers. A lone tear falls from his cheek onto my index finger, and I stop breathing. The heady silence is broken by his tearful laugh and I finally breathe out again.</p>
<p>“What?” I ask as his sweet, soulful, brown eyes meet mine.</p>
<p>“I was just thinking about how much my mother hated you and about what she would think about my holding your hand like this,” he said with a smile.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but tearfully laugh back even if it was at my own expense. “Yes, she would be none too pleased.”</p>
<p>We look away from each other and instead gaze at the city at our feet. Our city, our home. Well, it used to be my home. He clears his throat, nods his head behind us and shyly asks, “What about you?”</p>
<p>My voice sounds shaky—not my own. “My friend Katherine passed away. I don't know if you remember her or not.”</p>
<p>A sudden shiver ripples through me as my body remembers. Without a word he places his jacket over my shoulders, pulling me closer to him. His large arm encircles me while the ministrations of his fingers on my arm begin to calm my overworked nerves. I let out a breath I didn't know I had been holding.</p>
<p>My fingers brush the scratchy polyester jacket of his uniform just under the lieutenant insignia. He had done well, been promoted. I wanted to touch the cool brass bars, but years in the service had trained me to leave them unmarred by the pads of my fingers. He chuckles at me as if he can read my thoughts, making my cheeks hot and red with embarrassment. The visual show of my arrant embarrassment just serves to fan the flames of his laughter causing me to laugh with him despite myself. As our laughter dies down we fall into a companionable silence. Like magnets, our heads are drawn together, deepening our embrace. His free hand finds the hem of my dress and works it between the pads of his thumb and forefinger.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry about your friend,” he says.</p>
<p>I look up from the spot I had been studying on the step in front of me and meet his intense gaze. Our foreheads lightly press together.</p>
<p>My response comes out in a hoarse whisper. “She was Alex's....” taking a deep breath I continue. “She was the one who lost the baby.” </p>
<p>His eyes lower in remembrance. Trembling I reach up to clasp his hand in mine before I continue. “Her life was full of tragedy and despair, but she never gave up. She was amazing,” I say.</p>
<p>He sighs and his heavy-laden lids, still at half mast, avoid my searching gaze.</p>
<p>“Alex,” he says under his breath, a name that holds such meaning to us both. Looking up at me at last he asks me, “Do you want to talk about it? I think I am ready to hear it.”</p>
<p>His voice implores me to open up to him. I clear my throat, preparing myself to tell him the whole of it, unburden myself. I present to him my elegy to her.</p>

<p>What if <em>Pollyanna</em> took place in a present-day dystopia?</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/karalianne/novels/how-to-be-glad/stats,November 2015,"
<p>Nancy arrived at Pollyanna's location in record time. The child was standing on top of a large grey rock that had been left behind by the glaciers when they retreated aeons ago. Her arms were outstretched, her face pointed at the sky, and she was singing in a language Nancy had never heard before.</p>
<p>She stood quietly nearby, waiting for a suitable time to make her presence known. Finally the girl's voice grew still. Nancy waited, though, until the birds around them began their own songs once more. Somehow there was something sacred about the moment.</p>
<p>And then she didn't have to say anything after all, for Pollyanna turned and saw her.</p>
<p>A large smile spread across her face. ""Oh! Oh, I'm so glad to see you, Nancy!"" She scrambled down from the top of the rock. ""I was just singing to God. It's a song I learned in Angola, it's Portugese. I got here and looked around, and I was so overcome with gladness that I had to sing! Has that ever happened to you?""</p>
<p>""I'm sure it hasn't. Where have you been?"" said Nancy, her voice as stern as she could make it.</p>
<p>""Well, just here. I went out the window in my room and down the big tree. Then past the garage and across the fields!"" Pollyanna frowned. ""Have I been gone a very long time, Nancy? Is it time for supper? I am hungry.""</p>
<p>""It's past seven, Pollyanna. Your aunt is very upset that you missed your first dinner with her.""</p>
<p>Pollyanna's face fell and she bit her lower lip briefly. ""Is she quite cross, Nancy? I am very sorry, you know.""</p>
<p>Nancy sighed and put an arm around the child's shoulders. ""She has said that you are to have bread and milk in the kitchen when you return. It's too bad, too; the chicken was very good.""</p>
<p>""Oh! Oh, well, I'm glad for bread and milk then because I do like it very much. And I'm also glad for missing the chicken because maybe it means someone else could have more.""</p>
<p>They began walking back towards the house. Finally Nancy said, ""You are the oddest child I've ever met.""</p>
<p>Pollyanna giggled and danced ahead a little, then turned around to walk backwards, checking behind her every few steps to be sure of her footing. ""Why, what do you mean, Nancy?""</p>
<p>""Wel, just that you're so glad about everything, all the time. When my dad left I cried for a week.""</p>
<p>""Is your father dead too, Nancy?"" Pollyanna asked.</p>
<p>Nancy shook her head. ""No. At least, I don't think he is. He ran out on us when Frances was born. He couldn't hack it. Too many kids, he said.""</p>
<p>""Where did he go?""</p>
<p>Nancy shrugged. ""Last I heard he was in BC. Not sure why. Doesn't really matter, Mom got a divorce a few years after he left since he wasn't sending any money home so it was plain he hadn't gone looking for work like some of the other men.""</p>
<p>""That's too bad, Nancy, that he left and doesn't see you anymore.""</p>
<p>""Probably better this way though. He wasn't a very nice person."" And then Nancy clamped her mouth shut and wouldn't answer any further questions about her father, it having occurred to her that perhaps Pollyanna was too young and innocent to really know about things like abusive parents. Goodness knew she wasn't going to be the one to destroy that innocence.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Nancy said, ""You haven't told me about why you're always so glad about everything.""</p>
<p>""Oh! Oh, I'm glad you asked, Nancy. It's because of a game I played with Father.""</p>
<p>""A game?""</p>
<p>""Oh yes! It all started one day when the other children had all gone to play without me. I was feeling very sorry for myself, sitting on the step watching them. Father came and sat beside me. 'Why so glum, chum?' he asked. He was always saying silly things like that. 'Why so glum, chum?'"" She giggled. ""So I told him what was wrong, and he said that instead of thinking about how sad I was that the others left without me, I should think of a reason to be glad that they did it. At first I couldn't think of one -- how could I be glad that my friends had abandoned me? -- but then Father showed me.""</p>
<p>Nancy, who had been left out of or otherwise unable to join outings as a child, couldn't think of a thing. ""And what, pray tell, was there to be glad of in that?"" she asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>Pollyanna laughed and clapped her hands. ""Why, only that if I stayed at home I should be able to make them a lovely surprise for when they came back, and then I could finish my school assignments after that and have loads of time to play later on!""</p>
<p>Nancy snorted softly but caught herself. ""How are those things to be glad of? Seems to me you'd be doing a lot of work while your friends were off playing together, and then playing alone while they were working.""</p>
<p>Pollyanna nodded. ""Oh, I know, but I love to bake, so I made them cookies to eat while they were doing their work, and then it turned out that two of the girls had already finished their work so we played together! And then after that, we all always did some baking together before we did our work, so we could snack, you know, and then after we were all finished we all played together! It worked out really quite well, Nancy, because we all wanted to play together so much that we helped each other with the work, whether it was chores or school assignments, to get it done faster. And I was so glad to have them with me so often, since I hadn't any brothers or sisters of my own."" She looked a little wistful. ""Well, I did. I have three older sisters, you know, and one little brother. But they are all in Heaven with Mother and Father. None of them ever breathed once.""</p>
<p>They were quiet for a little while then, Nancy reluctant to step on the girl's grief.</p>
<p>""Oh, but Nancy, don't misunderstand me. I'm... I'm glad that they are all together now. It must be lovely in Heaven. I know that someday I'll get to see them all. But you know, about the Glad Game, it really isn't much fun to play by myself. I've been wondering if I should ask Aunt Polly to play. Do you think she would like it?""</p>
<p>Nancy nearly choked. ""Er, no, I don't think your aunt would appreciate it very much.""</p>
<p>Pollyanna looked thoughtful as she replied, ""I suppose you're right. Anyway, to tell it to her I would have to speak of father, and she did already tell me that I wasn't to bring him up."" At Nancy's horrified expression, she hastened to add, ""I'm sure it's just to save me the sadness. I imagine she knows what to do, since Grandfather -- her father -- is also gone.""</p>
<p>Nancy swallowed the words she wanted to say in response -- my, there were a lot of them -- and instead she said, ""Well, I may not be your aunt, but I will try to play the game with you. I don't know how good at it I will be, but I'm happy to try!""</p>
<p>""Oh! Oh, I'm glad, Nancy! And maybe we can ask Tim to play it too?""</p>
<p>Nancy smiled. ""Of course. I'm sure he'll be tickled by the idea.""</p>
<p>And then they were home, and it was time for Pollyanna's bread and milk.</p>

<p><strong>The Wolf &amp; the Bear</strong> (opening scene)<br/><br/>The Wolf Moon hung low in the sky, shining white and bluish grey through the black branches of leafless trees that reached up to the black starless sky as they presided over the chaos that rang out on the ground.<br/><br/>Men fighting.<br/><br/>No, not men.<br/><br/>Trolls.<br/><br/>A group of ten, all broad-shouldered and clad in furs and leather to keep them against the cold winter air, wielding swords and axes and shields as they danced in a circle about two men.<br/><br/>Wulf and Bera were twins, seventh sons of a seventh son, heirs to nothing but their father's name and the clothes they wore when they came of age. Similar in build to their adversaries, their dirt-brown hair was pulled back into plaits that started at the napes of their necks and disappeared into the folds of their fur cloaks.<br/><br/>Neither man held a weapon.<br/><br/>As the ten aggressors began to close in, Wulf looked over at his brother. The moonlight made Bera's eyes glow, and he grinned and nodded slightly.<br/><br/>As one, the twins reached for their hoods and pulled them up slowly over their heads.<br/><br/>The trolls stopped and looked at each other nervously. One of them let out a small yelp and dropped his axe, then turned around and ran away, his boot-clad feet slipping in the snow and mud.<br/><br/>Moments later, the air was filled with the sounds of growls, snarls, and the pained cries of wounded trolls. Blood spattered the snow as limbs were torn from bodies, and swords and axes fell to the ground one by one as their carriers lost their lives.<br/><br/>When the last troll had fallen, the wolf and the bear stood in the centre of a circle of body parts, blood, and entrails. <br/><br/>Wulf huffed air through his nose and gestured with it toward home. The village was far enough away that nobody would have heard the chaos, but close enough that they should be able to get there by dawn, if they hurried. Judging by the position of the moon, it was only midnight.<br/><br/>Bera moaned quietly and heaved his massive body forward. Wulf saw that he was limping, but he didn't worry too much about it; they'd both been injured in battle before, and traveling in Berserker form was much faster than human.<br/><br/>Together, the wolf and the bear moved quickly through the forest. Wulf took point and scouted ahead to ensure that they wouldn't come upon any men without warning. They skirted the witch's clearing and were halfway to the edge of the forest when Bera collapsed.<br/><br/>Wulf removed his hood and returned to his human form. He knelt by his brother and spoke quietly into his ear.<br/><br/>""Bera, you must remove your hood. I cannot carry you as a bear. You are too large.""<br/><br/>The bear lifted a paw and dropped it heavily into the snow. He moaned, his voice breaking with the effort.<br/><br/>Wulf smoothed his brother's fur and looked him over careully. Bera had been sliced by a sword. His ribcage was exposed and part of his front right leg was peeling away from the bone. Wulf's stomach lurched, and he turned away to empty his stomach into the snow. Heaving bile at the end of it all, he covered the vomit with snow and mud, then melted some fresh snow and rinsed out his mouth, spitting it away from the waste. He could see the blood trail from Bera's wounds, leading back to where the battle had taken place.<br/><br/>Keeping his face turned away from the wound, he leaned back in to speak into his brother's ear.<br/><br/>""Bera, I am going to fetch the witch. I cannot help you. If there is any hope, she will know what it is."" He shuddered at the thought of the witch, but he knew that it was the only way to help his brother. He buried his hands in Bera's thick fur and squeezed when he found skin. ""I will be back as soon as I can.""<br/><br/>Wulf stood and pulled his hood back over his head. He would travel faster in wolf form, and gods knew that he needed to move quickly this night.</p>

<p>Ashana cowered next to Oriel in their cabin as the ship bucked and dove through the stormy waves. She was wrapped in her heavy blue cloak, the hood pulled up over her head. She clutched the edges together tightly in her hands.<br/><br/>Oriel smiled and glanced down at her. He finished his preparations and stood, lifting his own black hood to cover his shaven head as he did so.<br/><br/>""Come, Ashana. We can't stay here much longer.""<br/><br/>The woman looked up at him, her blue eyes lifeless and her face expressionless. Her blonde hair, which was tucked into a braid down her back, was creeping out alongside her cheeks. ""Where will we go?"" she asked.

He willed his body not to respond; now was not the time to engage in carnal delights.<br/><br/>""We will go outside and I will speak with the Captain.

Spray drenched Ashana and Oriel, plastering their cloaks to their bodies.<br/><br/>The Captain, a scruffy man, shorter than Oriel but taller than Ashana, stumbled over to the couple, one hand holding his hat on his head while the other kept hold of his coat.<br/><br/>""What are you doing out here? It's dangerous!"" he shouted.<br/><br/>Oriel cocked an eyebrow and smiled grimly. ""I am going to help.""<br/><br/>The Captain let out a snort of derision. ""Help? How will you help? It's a storm, Sorcerer. Nobody can do aught about the weather.""<br/><br/>Oriel shook his head. ""How little you know of me."" He shrugged. ""No matter. I will calm the storm, and all will be safe."" Oriel looked around, scanning what he could see of the horizon. ""Do you know how far out we are?""<br/><br/>""We were just past the Sound when the storm came up,"" said the Captain. ""But I don't know for sure if we've been pulled further out to sea or pushed closer to shore. There are no lighthouses in this part of Kesht.""<br/><br/>Oriel frowned briefly, then blinked his eyes rapidly. It didn't matter, really, how far out from shore they were. The whole point of this was to calm the storm so that they could get to shore safely.<br/><br/>""You and the crew and passengers should go to the life boats and get off the ship,"" he said. ""Take my lady with you.""<br/><br/>The Captain shook his head. ""I don't think so. It's safer here on the ship than on those little rowboats.""<br/><br/>Oriel pushed Ashana toward the Captain. ""Do as I say. I won't have her hurt if something goes wrong.""<br/><br/>The Captain caught Ashana as she stumbled forward, steadying her with both hands. He looked up at Oriel. ""Whatever you say, Sorcerer. I know better than to get on your bad side. Don't expect us to come back for you, though. You're on your own.""<br/>Oriel shrugged and turned toward the bow of the ship. He needed to be facing the same way as the ship in order to do this right.<br/><br/>The Captain guided Ashana across the deck, calling out to his crew as he went. ""Come along, you lazy scum! We're taking the boats and leaving this Sorcerer to his magic! Collect the rest of the passengers and load them up!""<br/><br/>The men scrambled to do their captain's bidding, and soon enough the life boats were filled with people, huddling together for warmth and safety.<br/><br/>Oriel watched the last boat drop over the side of the ship and turned to face the ocean. He raised both his arms and lifted back his black hood. The wind and spray stung his scalp, and he smiled.<br/><br/>He stretched his arms out and up, his shoulders pushing at the thick leather armour that was part of his robes.<br/><br/>His fingers began their scripting, a simple but powerful binding rune that would calm the air and the water. Coupled with the spoken magic he'd been working on for the past hour, it should work much better than any spell any other Sorcerer had attempted in the past. Not that many of them tried this anymore. It was dangerous to try to control nature. There were stories about Sorcerers who could do it, but they had all lived hundreds of years ago. Oriel planned to be the first in his generation to display the talent.<br/><br/>He was half through the scripting and had just opened his mouth to begin the spoken magic when one of the masts snapped. As it collapsed, a heavy rope swung around and caught him on the side of the head. Oriel stumbled, his runic magic interrupted, and blinked as he watched the gleaming runes he'd been drawing in the air disappear from sight.<br/><br/>A half-done spell, of any kind, was the most dangerous thing about magic.Oriel lifted his hands to continue where he'd left off, but a huge wave crashed over the bow of the ship. Coupled with the drag from the collapsed mast, the ship pitched violently, and Oriel stumbled again. He tripped over a coiled rope and fell into the railing. His armour protected his upper body from being hurt too badly, but just as he was pushing himself away from the side of the ship, another wave connected with the ship. The rocking that followed was so strong that Oriel found himself bent over the railing. Before he could right himself, another wave captured his robes and pulled him over the side.</p>

<p>Book 2 of the Chronicles of Sarducia. I had already written book 2 but then I realized that there was so much missing from the first half that it should become two books, keeping most of it for book 3. So this project will fill in what happens between books 1 &amp; 3.<br/><br/>In the first book, By Moonrise (tentatively scheduled for publication in Dec. 2015), we meet Kate Norton, who unexpectedly travels to the island kingdom of Sarducia, a place of magic and mystery. She finds herself squarely in the middle of a dispute between two royal brothers and a group of mages known as the Sarnoc who hide most of their abilities from the king.<br/><br/>One of Kate's struggles throughout By Moonrise is to discover why she has traveled there and what her purpose is. At the end of the book it seems like she has found her ""happily ever after"" but political demands snatch that away from her almost immediately, forcing her to follow a new path that seems to go against the desires of her new friends and helps her enemies.<br/><br/>Beyond that? We'll see. :)<br/><br/></p>

1590,icefallstears,Novel: Hellhound Blues,Genre: Horror & Supernatural,13088,436,0,"
<p>In a AU 21st century world where polytheistic religions exist side by side with monotheistic ones; each pantheon has their own heaven and their own hell. The only beings who can move freely between the borders are the Reapers who ferry their passengers to heaven and hell, and the Hell Hounds whose job it is to know the scent of the condemned as well as to track and retrieve the very few condemned that manage to escape over the millennia.<br/><br/>Datura is unique among the denizens of the supernatural realms. A Hell Hound born into a humanoid form she was given the title of Huntress, and the responsibility of overseeing the hunts in the mortal world. Smart, cunning, and determined to prove herself to those who deem her anathema; she has never failed a hunt. However, the most recent escapee of the hells is more cunning than most and well knows how to use the every day life of the big cities to evade capture.<br/><br/>Jeremy is a doctor who has dedicated his life to helping those who desperately need it. He is compassionate, grounded, and fierce in his battle against losing his patients to death. If he happens to see shadows out of the corners of his eyes when patients die, it’s surely because he’s tired and stressed. Nothing could have prepared him  for the sight of a woman and a pack hounds, that no one else seems to notice, running through his hospital. Or for that matter, seeing a coma patient jump out of a 6th floor window and run away.<br/><br/>Datura does not need some one getting in her way and Jeremy is not about to stop trying to find his patient. But both are hunting the same being (sort of) and Jeremy knows more about the city than Datura. An arrangement has been struck, now it’s time to see if joining forces will help them save the people of the city from the evil that has been unleashed amongst them.</p>

<p>.At Stonehenge, just as dawn was beginning to creep over the land, the air made a sound as the ground itself was being torn in twain. Stepping out from under one of the lintels came an unusual sight. A young woman, pale, enrobed in shades of black, on either side of her two  massive hounds of black with eyes that blazed like flames. Following this unlikely trio came four more slightly less massive hounds of similar build and coloration; and following them, as if a separate unit, came seven more.<br/><br/>At the same time as the Huntress and her packs walked into the mortal realm those  that the priesthoods called gifted, including priests, oracles, seers, empaths and those just a tad more sensitive than the norm all felt as sense of deep foreboding run through them. The entire globe was effected. To those who had lived more than a few decades and had been trained in the mysteries of the afterlife both recognized the feeling and knew its significance. They were quick to teach the younger acolytes what the sensation meant and comfort those terrifed by it. A few very savy ones contacted whatever passed for law enforcemnet in their areas. A Hunt had been unleashed and that, historically, meant things were going to get bloody very quickly. Those that escaped from the underworld rarely returned quietly.<br/><br/>The woman in the lead of the Hunt removed her sun glasses and hooked them into a pocket on her leather jacket, revealing eyes that matched the hounds in color, luminescense, and ferocity. As one, she and all the hounds lifted their noses to the sky and took a deep inhalation through the nose and out of the mouth as if smelling and tasting the air. The  woman frowned, looked at the hounds, seemingly hearing an unspoken phrase and then they all repeated the act of sniffing the air. <br/><br/>The woman's frown deepened and she looked at the smaller, only by comparison, hound at her right hand. <br/><br/>""He is not here is he Inaya?""<br/></p>

<p>Bitch/Bastard</p>
<p>In a society where Gender is based on the needs of society, can love still change the hardest hearts.</p>
<p>Lucca and Rani are soldier trainees who were recently transferred to the Padua Military Academy. As with all academies, gender selection is a prize to be one or it is enforced by work selection based on grades and availability. Neither had given it thought before until Lucca is smitten by the Commodore's daughter in a chance meeting. Now he must fight to win his masculinity while also ingratiating himself to the Minola family.</p>
<p>This is complicated by Kai Minola and Peter Vera, who lead two separate platoons both vying for the last percentage of Gender Choice in the graduating class. Kai and Peter both have personnel reasons for needing to win and between them they risk the chances of all soldiers in their care.</p>
<p>Lock Keeper</p>
<p>Robyn Hasp is a Keeper of the Forest Lock, preventing harm to the trees and preserving the fragile ecosystem of the 'Delimitar'. Floating through space, the Delimitar is one of hundreds of ships built to ferry humanity through space until another home world can be found. The forest scrubs air and generates power for the ship through collection of unfiltered starlight. The forest also separated the central hub of the ship where navigation and command rule over the outer ring of the ship.</p>
<p>Robyn is the third generation born on the ship and begins to question the claims that the central hub has still found no planet to colonize. Others in the outer ring have begun to rebel against the control of the hub which is furthered by Robyn's research into their claims. The hub begins to squeeze the outer ring and Robyn uses the forest to keep those in control from destroying the people. All the while she attempts to rest control of the ship and possibly the future of its residents.</p>

<p>The violin died down as Gavin moved toward the stairs leading to the main deck. Lucas only played the instrument when they approached a turnaround, which meant Gavin would have to head for the helm of the ship. As he mounted the stairs, he felt the floor shift under foot. Whoever was training at the helm would be getting an earful from Commander Neal.</p><p>While Gavin was the captain, the task of training ship pilots fell on Commander Neal. A task he knew Neal enjoyed. The rope brace of the stairwell creaked as Gavin pulled himself up the eight steps from the berth to the main deck. The sun and the wind struck him as he cleared the wooden hatch and saw nothing but the beauty of open sky. In the distance, mountains marked the furthest point of his ship’s patrol.</p><p>The mountains contained small bands of Apache, Comanche and even Mexicans who would take shots at the Blackmore. Remnants of stronger tribes, disillusioned enough to think a small band could take over a flying vessel. Gavin knew it was folly to try and chase them down.</p><p>      The music was a bit louder on deck as was everything else. Sails shifted above Gavin. Two sails pulled from the main mast and one from the Fore mast at the head of the ship. An oval balloon sat directly above the main mast, fed by the ships engines. Men moved across the deck, working sails as the mountains approached. The men noticed the captain as he moved past them but concentrated on their work.</p><p>      The Blackmore had a sparse crew for her size. Weight was always a consideration given the engine in the lowest deck and the ship had to maintain flight elevation. They could land her in the water but so long as they patrolled over land, they had to wait for port. The warning bell for the mountain line rang out a few times, drowning out all other orders on deck. The sailmaker’s crew began to descend from atop the masts, riding ropes from the edges of the guide sails to the deck.</p><p>      Gavin stood on the main deck, staring out past the forecastle at the approaching mountains. Sailors landed on the forecastle after descending the foremast, scrambling down the stairs toward Gavin. The forecastle exposed you to the elements a bit more than the main deck, but the views were much better. It also served to create a pocket between the fore and aft castles where the wind was much lighter.</p><p>      Chief Clermont, the ship’s Sailmaker, assembled his crew to examine their work as it billowed on the foremast. The chief gave a slight nod to Gavin as the captain crossed the deck toward the aftcastle. Lucas sat cross-legged against the stairwell railing which led up to the command deck. His lean face was pressed against the heel of the instrument and continued to play as Gavin approached. He wore a working uniform of long pants and a long sleeved shirt. Not typical for an officer, but functional for Lucas’ purposes. Braces seemed to pull all the slack from the sleeves and legs as Lucas spotted Gavin.</p><p>      “A sad tune Commander. Not the thing I’d want to hear before plunging off the ship.” Gavin’s statement cut the music off mid-note.</p><p>The smile on Lucas’ face was the picture of British wit as he replied, “My mother once told me the Grim Reaper was drawn to frivolity and laughter. I figure a sad tune should keep him away, since we are tempting fate this afternoon.”</p><p>While the Blackmore’s function was patrolling the western border, Lucas had taken it one step further. He’d adapted a bit of technology he’d been working with in England before he and Gavin were shipped to the Americas. It was a set of thin cloth wings on a frame which could be manipulated by the wearer. They generated enough lift to keep a man afloat without an engine though their range was short.</p><p>Lucas had convinced Commodore Wood to allow the testing of the gliders. He claimed to be able to search deeper into the mountains and find any unknown attack points. Gavin thought it a foolish practice, placing your life in the hands of a glorified kite but Lucas could yield results. The small craft could keep an eye on the ship and report any activity when they returned to deck. Commodore Wood was so impressed with Lucas’ work that he allowed four men to fall under Lucas’ commission.</p><p>“The wind is pitching from the East. Make sure your men take account.” Gavin could not hide his dislike of the program though Lucas was an old friend. He respected the pilots who would give their lives to save his ship but also had too much respect for life to try such stunts.</p><p>      “Yes, my captain…,” Lucas replied with a proper British salute. “I have a new man I need recorded, sir.”</p><p>      It was the first Gavin had heard of the new pilot, though he wasn’t surprised. Lucas had a way of convincing people to try the scout craft but keeping a pack on people’s backs had proved more difficult. A trio of men stepped free of the forecastle door and walked toward Gavin. They all wore Lucas’s uniform though some had added a Monmouth Cap. The thin leather cap stuck to their skulls and had a buckle or two assuring it wouldn’t fly off. It offered nothing more than comfort, but the men wore them as a helmet.</p><p>      The men approaching were slender like Lucas. They varied in height but each wore a similar pack. Each satchel had a pair of folded winds attached to the satchel. The wings ran three quarters of the way to the deck. Gavin had seen two of these men before but was amazed at the third. They wore a few bracers on their arms and legs, each of which had wires leading back to the pack.</p><p>      “Commander,” one yelled as he snapped off a salute. “The wind is up if we want to get into the mountains. Now is the time.”</p><p>He sounded as if he was a volunteer from further North. Lots of Americans made their way to Texas in hopes of land and glory. The Texicans made promises which required taming all the land they claimed. Gavin didn’t know the history of all his sailors but he knew they were a mixed lot.</p><p>Lucas didn’t reply to the glider pilot. He simply pointed at Gavin with his violin bow and waited for the sailors to respond. Instantly one bellowed, “Captain on deck!”</p><p>Gavin always wondered if it was his quiet demeanor or perhaps because some captains didn’t walk their decks, but few sailors expected him on their level. Gavin gave a salute. He never asked for military pomp on deck, but Lucas insisted on it.</p><p>The Blackmore needed men skilled at their jobs. Gavin always felt it was skill, not strength, which kept them in the air. The men relaxed at his salute as Gavin said, “Gentlemen, I’m glad to see your enthusiasm. However your membership seems different.”</p><p>      The biggest of the three stood a half foot under Gavin with a wiry red brush racing around his face and lips. He looked past Gavin to Lucas waiting for an answer which would not come.</p><p>      “Aye Captain,” the redhead replied clearing his throat. “Shipman Beitz went on the last run with us, sir. He said he’d rather die falling from the sail rigging than tempt fate with us again, sir.”</p><p>      “That was his second go, correct.”</p><p>      “Aye, Captain. One more go than some.” Lucas interjected from behind Gavin.</p><p>      “And of these, Commander?”</p><p>      “O’Mally’s on his third and he’s the last of the first group I trained. Santiago’s gone once and Cayley going for the first time. Both came from the Engineer’s crew. Lieutenant Peck recommended them. He said neither could heft a hammer but why waste volunteers.”</p><p>      Gavin eyed the pair of sailors, both a few years older than Miguel. They all wore breeches of leather with wire rope and wood extending down to the deck. The fins on the calves of the pilots drew Gavin’s attention as Lucas cased his violin. Lucas shoved the case into a hollow at the base of the aftcastle stairs. He pulled on a similar set of Breeches as Gavin shook his head in amazement.</p><p>      “The frame alone looks like you would fall out of the sky. I can’t begin to imagine how you keep it aloft let alone control it.”</p><p>      “Force of will, Captain, and maybe a bit of the Queen’s love. No different than you and this tub I’d gather.” Lucas couldn’t help but poke at Gavin. They’d both joined the Royal Navy and now spent their days trying not to die above foreign soil.</p>

<p>Division of Labor<br/><br/>	Jonah Kemp flicked the nickel Zippo in his hand and lit the tip of a Marlboro Red.  He’d just stepped out onto the rooftop of his building and figured he might as well enjoy a smoke.  A uniformed officer moved toward Jonah, beyond the starched shirt a group of cops milled around.  It was one pull from the cigarette before the patrolman caught sight of the metal handle of Jonah’s thirty-eight.<br/>	“Gun,” he yelled as he pulled a sidearm and took aim at Jonah.<br/>	He hadn’t been trying to hide it; the shoulder holster he was wearing was on top of the shimmery green vest.  The steel handle of the Browning was flashy on all sides and if he hadn’t caught it Jonah would have been disappointed in the University police force.  This guy was obviously new, but no reason to lose sleep over it.  Jonah stared at the barrel of the Beretta in the officer’s hand and smiled.<br/>	“Officer Park, lower your weapon,” a thick southern voice called out from the milling group.<br/>	Jonah looked past Officer Park to Detective Sergeant Tyler Owens.  He shifted his eyebrows at Owens as the detective smirked.  Owens stared down the patrolman as Jonah pulled the cigarette from his lips and exhaled.<br/>	“Law says a man is allowed to a carry a firearm on his own property Officer Park.  Mister Kemp there, he’s just following the law.”<br/>	Park was confused, it was understandable.  Jonah walked past he officer and continued toward the center of the roof of his three story dormitory.  Owens smiled as best he could given the situation and motioned to a white sheet over a body.<br/>	“Your RA Lyndros said she was doing rounds and saw the roof access open.  She came out here and found another of your personnel, Edison Grint, dead on the scene.  She called the desk, your man Hodges called a uniform, we were on the scene ten minutes after.”<br/>	There was a whip of wind off the lake, catching the smoke from Jonah’s lips as he stared down at the sheet.  Edison wasn’t a bad kid, a little past twenty and he wasn’t going to see his twenty first.  He deserved better.<br/>	“Suicide,” Jonah asked, taking into account crimson soaking where the boy’s heart used to be.<br/>	“Not likely,” a voice replied from the edge of the roof.<br/>	Jonah looked at Owens who shifted focus toward a slender figure at the edge of the building.  Whoever it was, he bathed in the wind sheer as it broke over the top of the building, Jonah figured for effect.  There was a thick pause before the figure turned from the edge and took a step toward Jonah.<br/>	“Whoever put a bullet in your friend had a run of guilt.  ‘Cause he took a leap off this edge.”<br/>	Jonah stared at the new detective’s red lenses and couldn’t help but feel he was watching CSI: Miami.  Though the blonde in front of him was taller and more muscled, he figured Owens was senior detective.<br/>	“Who’s your guy, Tyler?”<br/>	“Sorry about that.  Jonah Kemp, this is Detective Kelvin Soest.  He just come in from Kansas City.  Kelvin, this is the building’s director.”<br/>	“Also the current owner of the land, I’ve read the reports,” Soest responded with an outstretched hand.<br/>	Jonah shook his hand with a nod though he hated being late to the party.  Soest eyed the gun in Jonah’s holster though made no mention of it.  Instead Jonah watched him crouch by the body and support his statement.<br/>	“Your gunman made a break for the second building well from here, though he could have easily gone down the first building well.  Any idea why he would do that, Mister Kemp?”<br/>	“Going down the first well puts him in my backyard.  Not where he’d want to be.”<br/>	“Especially not with that hand cannon you got there,” Owens commented under his breath.<br/>	“Second well also puts him further from the crowd.  Closer to the parking lot.  This wasn’t a negotiation; your hitter was here to tie up a loose end.”<br/>	“A lot of ‘loose end’ hits in Kansas City?”<br/>	“More’n you’d know Mister Kemp.”<br/>	Jonah raised an eyebrow in response and turned to Owens who was doing a horrible job of stifling a laugh.  There were other things Jonah had to deal with; the police report would be secondary.  He pulled a Blackberry from his pocket and thanked Owens for the call.<br/>	“I’ll tell Nastia and Hodges to make whatever you need available.  I’d like to get a resolution to this as soon as possible.”<br/>	“I’d imagine,” Owens replied.  “November is just around the corner.”<br/>	Jonah didn’t respond he focused on the Blackberry and tossed his cigarette to the ground.  He’d have to contact Edison’s mother and Dean Burke was probably on the way.  Now he had a hole in his staff, a body on his roof and the second week of September had just started.<br/>	A text lit up his phone, ‘Dean Burke is on his way! - N’<br/>	‘Assemble all, my office.  Top of the hour.’ He replied without a thought.<br/>	It was a half hour past midnight and his night was just starting.  Jonah had hoped for a smooth semester, this one wasn’t panning out so far.<br/></p>

<p>When they were alone in the room, Xan approached Chris but did not attempt to touch him again. ""I have to admit I am intrigued. You wear my son's face, you speak with his voice, but you are not Stophe.""<br/><br/>""No, Your Majesty, I suppose I'm not. I have his memories, but the boy you see before you is not the one who grew up in your palace.""<br/><br/>""A pity. I had hoped to see my son today.""<br/><br/>He should have been afraid of this man, but somehow the acknowledgement that this was not his father, that he was not the man's son, placed the king in the same category as the Troll Patrol: Just another bully trying to use intimidation to get what he wanted.<br/><br/>""Level with me, Sire. What is it you really hope to gain from the Sivarta living in your palace? Protection? Insurance?""<br/><br/>""I'm afraid I don't understand the question."" The struggle to maintain the facade was becoming more pronounced. King Xan was not a man accustomed to having his motives questioned, especially from the prince.<br/><br/>""Very well, I'll explain it slowly. What outside force do you fear so much that you would risk our presence here?""<br/><br/>""I fear nothing,"" Xan spat. ""Even though you are not Stophe, your presence would mean I could see him when you are in that other realm.""<br/><br/>""At least that much is true,"" Chris said, arms folded. ""Where I come from, people like you are the ones who are common. People who need to feel superior to others through intimidation, belittlement, and outright fear. We call them bullies. I've been dealing with your kind all my life. And the thing about bullies is that they don't invite the people who can stand up to them to live with them without there being some other, greater threat on the horizon. So I ask you again, 'Father,' what is your angle?""<br/><br/>The amazing thing was that if this truly had been Chris's father, he would have been jelly long before speaking out against him. He would have been too afraid to be alone in the room with him in the first place. This man looked so much like the Monster, that should have been enough to terrify him.<br/><br/>Jaw set in defiance, Xan folded his arms across his chest and said, ""There are those in my court who advised me that sentiment is for fools, and now I see that they were right. How will your compatriots feel to learn that you are single-handedly responsible for the offer being rescinded?""<br/><br/>""I expect they will thank me, because then they won't have to come up with an excuse to refuse it in the first place.""<br/><br/>For the first time since meeting him, Xan dropped the facade entirely, but what Chris saw behind it was not what he expected. The man before him sagged against the table, as though the fight was out of him. There was no rage there (though Chris could recall many times that Stophe had endured the rage Xan could produce), only sadness.<br/><br/>""I have made mistakes in my rule, Stophe. Most of them were with you. Or, him. I do not even know the name you answer to in that other realm. I thought that after a year he would have possibly forgiven me, but instead his memories have turned the stranger in his body against me. You ask me what it is that I fear. What demonic force would cause me to invite the six most powerful people in the realm into my home where they could potentially stand against me as I rule my kingdom? My simple answer is the one I have been giving all along: I'm afraid I have lost my son forever, that there is no possible way to reconcile the differences we have developed since the queen's death. I don't expect you to believe me. You've already made up your mind, and that is to be expected. All I ask is that when the time comes to decide whether or not to live here, you consider these words I have spoken to you here and not base it solely on the actions I truly and deeply regret.""<br/><br/>Chris could only gape at the man who had either just given the performance of a lifetime or lain his soul bare. He opened his mouth to speak, but all that came at first was a choked squeak, and he realized that he himself had tears in his eyes. The words coming out of Xan's mouth were the kinds of words he longed to hear from the man with a nearly identical face. He didn't have Brenda's powers, but the heart exposed to him was crystal clear.<br/><br/>Part of him wanted to Cross right then to give Xan a moment with his true son, but he knew Mentor would punish him if he did so. (Of course, that wouldn't be the first time he'd been punished for defying orders, would it?) Instead, he reached out and embraced a version of his father that actually felt some semblance of remorse for the treatment of his son.</p>

Unfortunately for him, his niece Zoe has come back from an expedition with a rare egg that will turn his life upside down. The newly hatched bird turns out to be a rare scrying bird, which must be delivered to the king in order to maintain the stability of the kingdom.<br/><br/>The premise of this world is that various species of parrot have the natural ability to channel magical powers. Mages can acquire and bond to these birds and then use them to perform a variety of tasks. I'm aiming to make the parrots realistic in terms of temperament and intelligence, so they're not reliable for things like combat, but they can be used for a variety of crafts. Magecraft isn't flashy and can be purchased as an apprenticeship if you can afford a bird. Late medieval technology is thus augmented by guilds with mages able to make things like bullet proof glass, easily reproducible texts and brightly colored fabrics. So basically, parrot-punk.</p>

<p>England’s mobile began to ring only moments before he felt the magic building. Unable to decide which summons to answer first he flipped open the gadget, which he was still trying to get used to (why did technology have to keep moving so quickly?) and started off at a brisk trot toward the center of London. The magic would have to be powerful indeed for him to be able to sense it through such a dense concentration of humans, each giving off their own faint magical vibrations. He didn’t like the idea of a mage that powerful in his land at all, let alone in his capital, his heart.<br/>He placed the phone to his ear as he jogged.<br/>“This had better be important,” he told whoever was on the other end. Any other irritation he might have expressed was cut short by the tone in his Prime Minister’s voice.<br/>“England? I need you here. Now. There’s an... incident developing and the military is rapidly running out of options.”<br/>“The military? What kind of incident? If it’s about that thing with France I swear I...”<br/>“It’s not France,” the voice on the other end of the phone was now betraying a hint of panic, “or at least I don’t think so. We don’t know who it is, or more accurately whose nuke it is.”<br/>England’s mouth went dry and his feet began picking up speed even as he changed direction, heading towards Downing Street. This close to the heart of his power it would only take him a few minutes to reach his destination, but they were minutes he might not have. He could hear voices faintly on the other end of the phone as the hand he had dropped to his side in shock moved the device back up to his ear.<br/>“Prime Minister? I’m on my way, about 5 minutes out. You have my permission to take whatever action to feel necessary to neutralize the threat until I arrive. Do you understand?”<br/>“I... yes sir,” came the reply.<br/>“Very good, I’ll ring off and be there shortly. Good luck.”<br/>England pocketed his phone and continued his sprint through the streets of London, moving at the speed only a nation within his own capital could hope to achieve. He could feel his own fear mounting, but despite the growing panic there was also a familiar sense of calm and authority that always came to him in a crisis, or in a war.<br/>I’ve survived invasion, war, empire and collapse. He told himself. I will survive this too. The sun will never set.

<p>I sometimes wonder if the shock of what happened that afternoon would have hit me so hard if we hadn’t been so recently ruminating on our marriage troubles. As we continued to relax in the pool I know I found myself mentally poking at the bond, much in the way I might have fussed with a emerging tooth as a child. The psychic shock might have been as intense regardless, but the extra attention I was paying to that part of my mind couldn’t have helped.<br/><br/>My memories of the actual assassination are hazy at best, and I suspect a number of them are really recollections I’ve picked up from other people who stayed conscious through the whole thing.<br/><br/>We were sitting on an underwater ledge in the pool, enjoying the water and the rare time to relax just the two of us when the psychic shock hit us. Marcus was the worst, being the only one with a formal bond to us, and because of the unnatural way it sat in our minds. The sudden absence of our mother and her consort was no small matter either though, and the combined shock and pain of their deaths, especially when our minds were braced for no such thing, was too much to handle.<br/><br/>According to Steve, who’d been on poolside duty, we were only unconscious for a minute or two, but in that time he and the rest of our security detail had gotten us out of the water and lying securely, if not comfortably on the deck.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the less coherent we are the harder it is for us to keep track of being two separate people, and for all intents and purposes we only really had one mind between us for that first little while after the assassination. It was a very good thing we didn’t have to move right away, because I don’t think either of us could have kept our respective limbs straight.<br/><br/>We came to slowly and uncertainly, unsure how to deal with the strange sensations flooding through our mind. There was pain, but of a kind different than we’d ever experienced before. Mental discomfort associate with loud noise, or with unpleasant thoughts being directed at a person were acute, and personal whereas this pain was dull, almost like the feeling of a sprain or a bruise, but at the same time it couldn’t be compared to physical pain, because in our hazy state it was impossible to pinpoint a source for it.<br/><br/>It took a few moments of becoming more alert for us to realize that the reason the pain was diffuse was that it came from the absence of our bond to Marcus. As imperfect as the marriage bond had been, it didn’t anchor in one specific place in my mind. Instead it spread itself out to touch both conscious and subconscious levels, so that it was like a subtle presence in my mind even when I wasn’t thinking about it. Except now it was gone, and in it’s place there was the strange pain that actually seemed to grow stronger the more we woke up.<br/><br/>By the time I was awake enough to open my eyes and see the ring of security officers hovering protectively over us I knew what had happened, at least in general terms. There was only way to sever a marriage bond, and that was through the death of one of the spouses. For Marcus to have been ripped from my mind at all, let alone so suddenly he must have died, and how that happened I wasn’t even prepared to guess.<br/><br/>Even as I came to that realization I also began to feel other not-right sensations in our mind. There were more silences, and more points of pain, less acute and pervasive, but still there.<br/><br/>Mother, I thought, and her consort, and I think some of the regular staff as well, although with them it’s harder to tell. What in hell happened?<br/><br/>I still wasn’t thinking particularly coherently, nor had I really grasped the weight of the fact that several members of my family had been killed, most likely by violence when Steve started to help me onto my feet.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry Your Eminence, I know you’re still in shock, but we need to get you to a more secure location. Can you walk, or do we need to carry you.”<br/><br/>Your Eminence.<br/><br/>The words bounced around in my head as, since I hadn’t responded, Steve picked me up and, with a large contingent of armed guards, took us back to the family wing. They had time to get us both dried off, dressed and settled in the living room before it really sunk it and I was capable of something approaching coherent though.<br/><br/>My mother was dead, which meant I was now Emperor, with a possible assassination to sort out and a baby due any day. Whatever problems I might have been dealing with when I got up this morning suddenly paled in comparison.<br/></p>

<p>A <em>Sekirei</em> AU fantasy story (that will be adapted to an SF Original Fic story once done).</p><p>For millennia, there have been warnings about the high mountains to the north of Yamato. ""Don't go there; there be dragons."" And ""whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad"". They form an impassable barrier; in order to conduct trade and diplomatic relations with the nations to the north, ships have to be launched from the cities to the south.

After having failed the entrance exams to the university for a second time, his friends decide to take him on a ""better you than me"" trip, and get him a bit of breathing space from his mother.

But they have no idea what awaits them.</p><p>Nor do they realize that there are other Yamatoans who have gotten there first. Minaka Hiroto and Sahashi Takami, Minato's parents, were the first in millennia to discover the truth of the dragon legends. Now Minaka's company MBI is mining the mountains, and there are many flocks of dragons who are <em>not happy</em> about this.

<p>“Ow,” Sahashi Minato muttered, as he carefully levered himself to his feet. Just his luck to have sprained his ankle in the fall. And he <em>knew</em> it was sprained; he’d done that to his ankles often enough before that he could recognize the pain.</p><p>“This is the last time I listen to one of Ichiro’s wild ideas,” he continued talking to himself, as he limped over to the slope he’d slid down. The very high slope; it was about three times his height at a minimum. He actually <em>was</em> lucky that he hadn’t done worse than sprain his ankle.</p><p>“The <em>very</em> last time. ‘Come on, Minato, I’m sure you’ll find <em>loads</em> of plants that no one has seen before! The professors will be <em>begging</em> you to provide them with samples! You won’t have to worry about the results of your entrance exam! Don’t worry, we all know dragons don’t exist!’”</p><p>He sighed as he reached the slope and looked up it. Muddy and steep; there was no way he was going to be able to free-climb it with his sprained ankle. He’d have to wait until one of the others found him and let down a rope.</p><p>Grabbing hold of a rock that was sticking out of the slope, he lowered himself to the ground again.</p><p>Almost as if his luck had just been <em>waiting</em> for him to get settled, once again it started raining.</p><p>“Damn it, facing Mom would be easier than this,” Minato grumbled, as he shifted a bit closer to the slope in the hopes it would keep him from getting absolutely drenched.</p><p>That almost made him smile. Compared to facing Mom with the results of his failing the university entrance exam, hiking through the Forbidden Mountains – which had been taboo since as far back as any of Yamato’s records showed – was nothing. That was just in good weather, however. Being <em>lost</em> in them in the middle of a thunderstorm? Nope, facing Mom <em>had</em> to be better than that.</p><p>“Damn it,” Minato repeated, as a particularly cold bit of rain got underneath the neck of his sweater and crawled down his back. “When I get back to camp, I’m going to <em>kill</em> Ichiro….”</p><p>This entire expedition had been the brainchild of Yasaka Ichiro, one of Minato’s oldest friends. Knowing what Minato’s mother was like, he’d suggested a way to avoid her – and possibly get some sort of credit that could make up for his failed exam at the same time. The Forbidden Mountains were very fertile – everyone knew that from reports of ships that sailed north of the island – and were likely to have a variety of plant-life that couldn’t be found elsewhere. And since no one had ever survived exploring them and coming back, they had no records of what could be found.</p><p>Not to mention the potential for mapping magical ley lines, which was probably how Ichiro had persuaded Mikogami Hayato, another friend of Minato’s, to accompany them. Minato couldn’t think of any other reason Hayato would have ended up coming with them; he didn’t think too highly of Ichiro.</p><p>But thinking about what had gotten them into this situation wasn’t doing Minato any good at the moment; it was just irritating him further. Which didn’t exactly help him figure out a way to get back up the slope.</p><p>Nor did it get him un-lost. He wished he’d known more about mountain weather before they’d come; he hadn’t expected the mist that had come up in the middle of his searching for interesting plant samples. Nor had he expected this storm. Although it looked like Ichiro was right about the dragons just being rumours used to explain the taboo….</p><p>He just hoped that the others weren’t lost as well; if they were, he could probably kiss any hope of getting out of this situation good—</p><p><em>:Grab hold of the rope. There’s a direcat coming in this direction.:</em></p><p>Minato blinked, even as one end of a thick hemp rope slithered down the slope toward him. The voice echoed oddly, and it wasn’t familiar – it definitely wasn’t Ichiro, Hayato, or Seo – so who could it be?</p><p><em>Worry about that later. Right now I’m getting rescued. And if they’re right about a direcat coming, I’d better move….</em></p><p>Direcats were the apex predators of Yamato Isle, slick killing machines who were made more deadly by the fact that they could use magic to entrap their prey. Minato had no desire to find out how he would fare against one, especially as he had no magic with which to defend himself. Never-Out Lights and Stasis Boxes were no defense against claws, teeth, and bright, dazzling flashes.</p><p>Levering himself to his feet again, Minato grabbed hold of the rope with both hands and began to haul himself up the muddy slope. It was more difficult than it would have been with two good ankles, but at least the rope was strong enough – and well-anchored enough – that he didn’t fall again. It was close – his feet slipped a few times as he got closer to the top of the slope – but he made it.</p><p>Once he was on the flat he’d fallen from, Minato just lay splayed on the ground for a long moment, trying to recover from the exertion of climbing.</p><p><em>:Direcats <strong>can</strong> climb, you know. I don’t think you want to continue just <strong>lying</strong> there. There’s a cave nearby we can take shelter in until the rain stops.:</em></p><p>No, the voice definitely wasn’t familiar. Pushing himself to his knees, Minato looked over – and almost fell again.</p><p>Standing next to a large tree that the other end of the rope had been tied around was a creature that Minato could only describe as a dragon.</p><p>It was large – its shoulder probably came to at least his waist, Minato estimated, staring – with silver scales, wings folded against its sides, a long neck, and a head that looked like someone had blended a cat and a crocodile together, and made the blending smooth. Pointed ears and burgundy-red eyes with slitted pupils were both directed toward him.</p><p><em>:You’re gaping like a dead fish.:</em></p><p>“Wha—” Minato blurted out. <em>Dragon!  They’re real!  It’s a <strong>dragon</strong>!</em></p>

<p>Ivy headed back to the counter.<br/><br/>When she got there, Suzanne was back.<br/><br/>""What were you doing?"" Ivy hissed at her. ""I had to come out to help a customer.""<br/><br/>Suzanne blinked at her. ""It's part of your job too,"" she pointed out. ""And I wasn't skipping or anything, I had to help a different customer."" The girl sighed. ""I don't know <em>what</em> the boss thought he was doing with this new organization scheme, but I really don't think it's working too well.""<br/><br/>Okay, that was an excusable reason for Suzanne not to have been at the counter. Mr. Bailey's new organizational scheme for the books <em>was</em> proving to be an issue, especially with students who'd been at Dalhousie for more than a year.<br/><br/>""All right, you're forgiven,"" Ivy declared, shaking her head. ""I just...."" She hesitated, then gestured at her legs with her cane. ""I prefer to sit down as much as possible right now.""<br/><br/>""You never told me what happened,"" Suzanne mentioned, as she pulled the stool out from behind the counter and shoved it in Ivy's direction.<br/><br/><em>That's because you'd never believe me,</em> Ivy thought wryly, remembering the confusion of levinbolts, swords, and blood that had been the mess she'd stumbled into a fortnight ago. <em>Thorn <u>curse</u> those idiots for doing that in the middle of the campus....</em><br/><br/>""It's a long story,"" she replied instead, sitting down. Suzanne, despite the pretty ditz appearance, was a hard-headed engineering student, who firmly did <em>not</em> believe in magic or mysticism. ""I don't like to think about it.""<br/><br/>Which was also true.  Ivy had only minimal magics, just enough to protect herself in the middle of a magical battle. And considering she'd been trying to protect others instead, well... she hadn't been able to protect herself when the levinbolt had slammed into her back. It had only been the fact that it had been reflected off the ground, reducing the amount of force behind it, that had kept her from being either fully paralyzed or killed. Not something she liked to remember.<br/><br/>""Have you seen a doctor about it yet?"" Suzanne persisted.<br/><br/>The other girl was rather nice, for a hard-headed human, but there were times when her concern could drive Ivy up the wall. This was one of them. ""I don't need to see a doctor,"" she repeated, for the fifth time in the last week.  ""There's nothing any of them could do for me, and they can't tell me anything I don't know.""<br/><br/>Namely, that it would be several months before her legs (and spine) recovered from the damage done.<br/><br/>""What about a physiotherapist?"" Suzanne persisted. ""They might be able to help you get better faster. And what if there's something you don't know, some extra damage you haven't realized you have?""<br/><br/><em>She's a friend. She's trying to help,</em> Ivy reminded herself, doing her best to keep herself calm. Suzanne was just being helpful and concerned, she was <em>not</em> 'overstepping her bounds'. It was times like these, when her heritage came to the fore, that Ivy wondered if she was ever going to succeed in living properly in the human world, and she remembered her brother's admonishments.<br/><br/><em>But he's wrong, I <u>can</u> do it. I have so far, and I'm sure humans also have moments of irritation like this,</em> Ivy told herself firmly. She was <em>not</em> going to doubt herself now, not after going to so much trouble to establish herself here in Halifax and at the university. Not even when she ended up in the middle of a duel between some bravos of the Seleighe Court.<br/><br/>""I'll be fine,"" she assured Suzanne confidently. ""I know what's wrong, and there really isn't anything that can help it get better faster.""<br/><br/>Nothing except Seleighe Healing, and she was <em>not</em> going to return to the Court where she was routinely looked down upon just to take advantage of a Healer's presence. It was annoying, but she would cope - and it was far less dangerous to her if she coped, than if she swallowed her pride and went crawling back to her family and the Court. Though she didn't think Suzanne would understand that, any more than she would understand what it was that had happened to Ivy to cause this.</p>

<p>Joe was already there and waiting when Brendan arrived at the head of the Lake Trail.<br/><br/>“How’s it going?” the nurse asked, as they started along the trail.<br/><br/>“Fairly well,” Brendan replied, stretching his arms out.  “Yesterday’s rescue just got on my nerves because it was due to tourists wandering off the trail and getting lost.”<br/><br/>“Happens,” Joe declared.  “So, all the way to the lake and back?”<br/><br/>“Sounds like a plan,” Brendan agreed.<br/><br/>The two of them walked along in companionable silence, enjoying the quiet of the afternoon and watching the birds and animals moving through the forest around them.<br/>This, even more than their interactions over rescues, was what made Joe a friend – that they could enjoy each other’s company while hiking, but they didn’t need to talk to each other.  Joe was usually garrulous – which tended to irritate Brendan – but not while hiking.<br/><br/>As Joe had mentioned earlier, it was a gorgeous day out.  The foliage was just starting to turn to fall colours, and it was still warm enough to go out in a shirt and light pants – but cool enough that you could get some exercise outside and not get overheated.  The sun was shining – brightly enough that Brendan had been wearing his sunglasses from the moment he’d left the apartment building – and it was exactly the right sort of day for a walk outside.<br/><br/><i>Poor Ryuu, stuck inside all day.  I hope tomorrow’s weather is the same, so he gets to experience some of it.</i><br/><br/>Summer this year had been rather hotter than Ryuu liked, as Brendan knew from the complaints he’d had to listen to about it.  This type of weather, on the other hand, seemed to be Ryuu’s ideal.  So yes, he certainly hoped Ryuu got the chance to enjoy it while it lasted.  Winter would be here all too soon.<br/><br/>Later, Brendan would be thankful for not noticing the root in the path.  As his foot hit it and he started to fall, however, all he could think was, <i>Oh, hell....</i><br/><br/>A moment later, searing heat passed over his back, where his chest had been a second ago.  As Brendan hit the ground, he rolled over to see the tree that he’d been beside bursting into flames, and Joe looking white as a ghost.<br/><br/>“What...?”<br/><br/>“Shit, Brendan, that was a plasma bolt!” Joe blurted.<br/><br/>“Get down!” Brendan snapped immediately, reaching out to sense the minds in their vicinity.<br/><br/><i>Damn, missed – got to get closer...</i> came the thought from someone about a hundred and fifty metres away.<br/><br/>At the same time, Ryuu evidently sensed his agitation over the link, for his partner reached out for him.  <i>:Brendan, what’s wrong?:</i><br/><br/><p><i>:Someone just took a potshot at me with a plasma bolt!:</i> Brendan replied, grabbing Joe’s arm and crawling off the trail, away from the mind that had shot it.  “Move as quickly and as quietly as you can,” he hissed to his friend.</p><br/><br/><i>:A plasma bolt?:</i>  Ryuu’s thoughts felt shocked.  No surprise there – Brendan was shocked himself.  <i>:Where are you?:</i><br/><br/><p><i>:The Lake Trail at the park – call the fire department as well, because the shot hit one of the trees and it’s starting to spread,:</i> Brendan added, with a wary glance at the tree now behind them.</p><br/><br/>For a moment Ryuu’s thoughts descended into cursing, and then Brendan got the sense that he was moving.  <i>:Right.  Be careful, Bren.  I’m getting Lieutenant Maguire right now.  It’ll take us about five minutes to get there – can you keep away from both the shooter and the fire until then?:</i><br/><br/><p><i>:Doing my best,:</i> Brendan responded.  The shooter had temporarily lost track of them, judging from what Brendan could pick up from him, but that wasn’t going to last long.  Truthfully, at the moment the fire was the more immediate concern, which was why Brendan was leading them towards the lake as fast as he could crawl.</p><br/><br/>“What the hell is going on, and where are we going?” Joe hissed from behind him.<br/><br/>“Shh – and to the lake,” Brendan replied quietly.  Doing a quick scan of the shooter’s mind – he still hadn’t found their trail – Brendan then glanced back towards where he was.<br/><br/>The fire was spreading rapidly enough to conceal them from his sight, and it was unlikely he’d try to get through it even if he <i>did</i> spot them.<br/><br/><i>Hells,</i> Brendan thought furiously, pushing himself up and motioning for Joe to do the same, then starting to run as fast as he could towards the lake.  <i>Just be glad it rained yesterday and the ground cover is still damp enough that the fire isn’t spreading <u>too</u> rapidly!</i><br/><br/>“Are you expecting us to be able to outrun a forest fire?” Joe snapped, as he followed suit.<br/><br/>Brendan glanced back over his shoulder again.  “If we’re lucky, yes!  That’s why we’re making for the lake.  We’re going to have to go for a dip.”<br/><br/>“Great.  What the hell is going on?” Joe repeated.<br/><br/>“I have very little idea,” Brendan replied.<br/><br/>The next second, they reached the small precipice that led down to the lake itself.  Turning around, Brendan lowered himself down, followed by Joe, and winced as he noticed how close the fire had gotten.  “Come on,” he urged, and dove for the lake.<br/><br/>Once in the water and a couple of metres from shore, Brendan relaxed a bit.  They were safe enough for the moment, and the shooter had taken off down the path towards the end of the trail when he’d realized what his plasma bolt had done.  Brendan was still tracking him, however.<br/><br/>And after a second’s thought, he reached out to search the rest of the park in and around the trail, to make sure that no one got caught by the fire.<br/><br/>Luckily, it seemed that not many people had had the same idea as Joe today, because aside from the shooter, those people who were in the park were a safe distance away from where the fire was at the moment.<br/><br/><i>:We’re almost there, Bren.  What’s the situation?:</i> Ryuu asked.<br/><br/>Brendan gave him a quick summary of what had happened, including the current location of the shooter.<br/><br/><i>:You’ve got him tagged?:</i><br/><br/><p><i>:Yeah,:</i> Brendan agreed.  <i>:I want to know what the hell’s going on.  I couldn’t get anything from his surface thoughts about <u>why</u> he was trying to kill me, just that he was.:</i></p><br/><br/><p><i>:And he wasn’t aiming at Joe instead?:</i> Ryuu asked.  Covering all bases, Brendan recognized.</p><br/><br/><i>:No.  Joe was a few feet farther down the trail, and if I hadn’t tripped, the bolt would have hit me in the chest.:</i><br/><br/><p><i>:Near misses from plasma bolts seem to be becoming a habit,:</i> Ryuu sent darkly.  <i>:Are you burned anywhere?:</i></p><br/><br/><p><i>:Not that I can tell – it didn’t get <u>that</u> close,:</i> Brendan replied.  Then he caught sight of a flitter in the distance.  <i>:Looks like the fire department is here.:</i></p><br/><br/><p><i>:They got an emergency call from someone in the park who saw the flames starting,:</i> Ryuu stated.  <i>:Is there anyone else in the area of the fire?:</i></p><br/><br/><p><i>:No, just Joe and I in the lake,:</i> Brendan replied, after another quick scan of the area.</p><br/><br/><i>:Good.  I’ll let them know.  Where is your shooter – and are you able to give me a description?  Maguire and I are just reaching the park now.:</i><br/><br/>Taking a second to pinpoint the shooter’s location, Brendan winced.  <i>:He’s mingling with a crowd of gawkers.  And no, can’t manage the description – he was concentrating on shooting at me, and now at becoming one of the crowd.:</i><br/><br/><p><i>:Damn.  Okay, which group of gawkers?:</i></p><br/><br/><p><i>:Head of the Lake Trail,:</i> Brendan replied.</p><br/><br/><i>:Got it.  I’ll let Maguire know.  You guys do your best to stay put until we get there.:</i><br/><br/>Brendan sent back a blast of exasperation, and returned his attention to Joe, who was swimming casually around.  “You okay?”<br/><br/>“I was a bit out of breath when we got here, but I’m good now,” Joe replied.  He shook his head.  “This was <i>not</i> what I was planning for today.”<br/><br/>“If it cheers you up any, neither was I,” Brendan stated, sighing.<br/><br/>“Ah, but you’re the one who is <i>used to</i> excitement,” Joe countered.<br/><br/>“And you’re not, Mr. Helps-Out-In-The-ER?”<br/><br/>Joe shrugged, though he didn’t deny it.  “So what do we do now?”<br/><br/>“Hang out here for a while,” Brendan replied.  He pointed over to where the flitter he’d noticed a few minutes ago was hovering around the fire.  “The fire department’s here, and is getting started on handling the fire.  And Ryuu and the cops are almost here.”<br/><br/>While the existence of Brendan’s link-gift – the ability to form links and thus speak mind-to-mind with other telepaths without touching – was classified, most of their friends at least knew that Brendan and Ryuu could communicate without speaking.  It had come in handy on enough search and rescue jobs and security assignments in the last year that no one asked questions about it, just accepted it as fact.<br/><br/>“Good.  Any chance they can grab whoever was doing the shooting?”<br/><br/>Brendan shrugged in response.  “I’m tracking him, the same way I track people when I’m working search and rescue, so I know where he is – but whether Ryuu and the police can catch him is... well, I’m not sure.  He’s in with a crowd of people.”<br/><br/>Just then, the part of his mind that was monitoring the shooter sensed a surge of alarm.  <i>Psi Department?  What the hell is a Psi Department agent doing with a cop?</i><br/><br/><p><i>:Ryuu, he’s spotted you,:</i> Brendan relayed through the link to his partner.</p><br/><br/><i>:Got it,:</i> came the reply.  <i>:Hold on, I’m going to scan those we’ve got here....:</i><br/><br/><p><i>:Be careful – I don’t think he dropped his gun, and you’re in a crowd with the potential for either hostages or hostilities,:</i> Brendan urged silently.</p><br/><br/><i>:Yes, ‘mother’,:</i> Ryuu returned.  <i>:What’s that saying Professor Harding likes so much?  ‘Teach your grandmother to suck eggs’?:</i><br/><br/><p><i>:That’s it.:</i></p><br/><br/><p><i>:And... ahhh!:</i></p><br/><br/><p><i>:Ryuu?!:</i> Brendan sent, alarmed.</p><br/><br/>He got a round of curses back.  <i>:Damned frigging idiot!:</i> Ryuu sent finally.  <i>:He fired at Maguire and I.  We managed to evade, and Maguire tackled him.  Whoever this guy is, he is <u>not</u> a professional.:</i><br/><br/><p><i>Great,</i> Brendan thought privately.  <i>So why the hell was he shooting at me?</i></p><br/><br/><p><i>:Maguire is sending him in to the station with the backup that came with us.  Then he and I are going to fly over to where you are.  Is there an area large enough to land the flitter nearby where there’s no flames?:</i></p><br/><br/>Brendan winced as he checked the shoreline.  <i>:Not right by us.  A bit farther over to the north there is.:</i><br/><br/><p><i>:Okay, you and Joe make your way there and we’ll meet you.:</i>  With that Ryuu cut off the link.</p><br/><br/>“C’mon, Joe, we’ve got to walk a bit,” Brendan said out loud.<br/><br/>“What?”  Joe stared at him in confusion.<br/><br/>Motioning towards the shore, Brendan shrugged.  “They can’t land a flitter right there.  But over there,” he pointed to the promontory a bit to the north, “there’s enough space to land it safely and not get caught by the flames.  So Ryuu and Lieutenant Maguire are going to meet us there.”<br/><br/>“Right.  Well, let’s get walking....”</p>

<p>Detective Sergeant Darrel Greene of the Toronto Police Services Drug Squad doesn't believe in spirits, much less spirit-animals. Mayumi Miyanobo, a <i>kitsune</i> - or spirit-fox - from Kyoto, doesn't trust the police, especially not those who don't believe she exists. Under normal circumstances, they would have never crossed paths.<br/><br/>But a dangerous, highly addictive drug is flooding the streets of Toronto, and certain among the Greater Spirits believe that Mayumi and Darrel must join forces to end the threat it poses. Only... how can they work together when Darrel flatly refuses to believe that Mayumi is <i>kitsune</i>?</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/trudyg/novels/a-fox-s-fight/stats,November 2009,"
<p>Darrel sighed as he slipped out of the small alleyway where he’d found one of his street contacts (the inspector <i>much</i> preferred that term to ‘snitches’).  So far, he wasn’t having much luck; and judging from her careful replies on the radio when they checked in with each other, Nancy wasn’t having the greatest of luck either.<br/><br/>The one thing cheering him up about all this (aside from the dreary fact that he’d <i>known</i> after the Police Academy that at least 90% of all police work was footwork) was that at least the two of them weren’t the only members of the Drug Squad out searching for more information on D-Light.  He’d overheard a few of the others exchanging similarly dismal reports.<br/><br/>Sighing again, he headed down the street toward Max’s Cafe.  A small, seedy, hole-in-the-wall place, it was where he knew he could find Esther.  She was <i>always</i> there; Darrel suspected that in the winter, Max let her stay in the shop overnight.<br/><br/>Esther was one of his best contacts, the Grand Dame of Queen Street herself.  He’d first met her as a callow young constable First Class, still squeaky new when it came to the real truth of life on the streets, despite having grown up in one of the poorer areas of Toronto.  Esther had taken him under her wing and taught him a great deal about how to keep a hold of the pulse of the streets, how to read moods of people whose lives sometimes depended upon <i>not</i> being read, and a great many little tips and tricks that had helped him survive and mature.  She was out on the streets by choice, Darrel often suspected; but only because what she’d left behind was worse, to her mind, than what happened out here.  If <i>anyone</i> knew what was going on, or had a hint of it, Esther should be aware of it.<br/><br/>“Hello, handsome,” she called out, the moment he entered the cafe.<br/><br/>“Hello, gorgeous,” he replied right back.  And it had a certain amount of truth to it; despite Esther’s being in her eighties, and having lived on the streets at least twenty-five years, she had aged remarkably gracefully.  And Darrel <i>knew</i> that Max let her wash up in back when she couldn’t go to the YMCA or any of the other sanctuaries to shower.  (That was what had struck him first about her, though he <i>hadn’t</i> been stupid enough to mention it out loud; for a ‘street person’, she kept herself very clean.)  “Can I get you a coffee?”<br/><br/>“Double cream, no sugar,” she replied, just as she always did.  It was a familiar ritual between them; and in fact, Max already had both her coffee and his usual tea poured when Darrel reached the counter.<br/><br/>“The usual,” he said, as Darrel took out his wallet.<br/><br/>Also as usual, Darrel left him a tip equal to the value of the drinks.  Max was a good guy.<br/><br/>“It’s been a while, hasn’t it,” Esther said, as Darrel sat down at her table and handed her the coffee.<br/><br/>“I’m afraid so.  I’m sorry about that, Esther.  Things have just been... busy lately.”<br/><br/>“Yes, I imagine they have been.”  Esther gave him a mysterious smile.<br/><br/><i>Yep, she knows something.</i><br/><br/>“And your partner, how is she doing?”<br/><br/>“She’s well,” Darrel replied.  He’d learned early on not to force the conversation in the direction he wanted it to go, though it had been a hard lesson to learn; still was, in many ways.  “She’s now <i>very</i> happily married.”<br/><br/>“Ah, yes, you mentioned her honeymoon last time.  And her husband?”<br/><br/>“He’s good to her,” Darrel assured her.  “Absolutely head over heels.  And being from the Crown Attorney’s office, he knows all about bad hours at work.”<br/><br/>“That’s very good to hear.”  Esther’s smile widened as she took a sip of her coffee.  “And speaking of things heard....  I hear that your people are having a time of things, indeed.”<br/><br/>“Yes, we are,” Darrel admitted.<br/><br/>“Well, you’ve had a wee bit of luck, laddybuck.”  Esther took another sip of her coffee, then leaned forward.  “From what I’ve heard and seen on the street, my boy, you’re hunting in the wrong herd for your prey.”<br/><br/>“Oh?” Darrel asked, no longer confused by Esther’s terminology.  Hunting metaphors peppered her speech when she was giving him information.  “How so?”<br/><br/>“The ones like that poor man who died yesterday... they’re just the small fish in the pond.  But to look for the big fish, you need to check a different pond.”<br/><br/>Darrel blinked for a moment, surprised.  “The manufacturers <i>aren’t</i> in Toronto?” he asked, lowering his voice - not quite to a whisper, but soft enough no one other than Esther would be able to hear him.<br/><br/>“And there you go, boyo.  You’re canny-wise when you want to be.”<br/><br/>“Hmm...” Darrel murmured, taking a sip of his tea.  <i>Ah, bliss.</i>  “The question then becomes, why choose Toronto to distribute it?  We’ve asked around, and it hasn’t shown up much in other cities - just a few dribs and drabs that are most likely dealers checking out the markets.  But if they’re not actually <i>here</i>....”<br/><br/>“Ah, now that’s getting into the <i>deep</i> stuff, laddybuck.  I have some ideas, but I can’t tell you why.”<br/><br/>Darrel knew that tone, and those words.  Unless Esther <i>knew</i> something, she wouldn’t tell him; ‘too likely to lead you down a false trail’ she’d explained, more than once.  And he’d reluctantly had to admit that it made sense; if she told him something and he thought it was true, he wouldn’t look for other answers.<br/><br/>“Is there anything else you <i>can</i> tell me?” he asked.<br/><br/>“Glad you asked, boyo, and the answer is ‘yes’.  You wanted to know who had taken that poor man’s place, didn’t you?”<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>Esther’s smile looked almost predatory for a moment, but the expression vanished as though it had never been, as her mouth returned to her ‘mysterious’ smile.  “I believe you know the name Raoul Lafonce?”<br/><br/>“Indeed I do,” Darrel responded, sure his own smile was definitely predatory.  “Thank you, Esther.”<br/><br/>“Hmph.  Thank me by staying until you finish that tea of yours and telling me about the last few months.  I get to hear the street’s words, but not yours?”<br/><br/>“Given you may have just saved my partner and I from another several hours wandering about, it would be my pleasure, m’lady.”<br/><br/>“Ah, ah,” Esther said, raising one finger to correct him.  “Never lay the flattery on too thick, laddybuck.  The ladies will think you’re teasing them if you do - and that’s never a good thing to have happen.”<br/><br/>“My apologies,” Darrel responded.  “But I wasn’t lying when I said that you just saved Nancy and I several hours of footwork.  Paperwork, no - but at least we’re going to be able to return to Headquarters.  So yes, I will stay long enough to finish my tea.”<br/><br/>It was rare that he did so, but not unheard of; and for the next forty-odd minutes, Darrel gave Esther a summary of his life over the past several months.  He got the occasional sharp word for not coming in at some point or another to see her, but that was all; she <i>did</i> understand that he tended to be busy, after all.<br/><br/>Finally, he finished the last of his tea, and tossed the paper cup in the recycling bin Max kept near the back of the cafe.  “Shall I get you another coffee, Esther?”<br/><br/>“No thanks, I’m good,” she replied, as Darrel stood up.  “And I wish you all the luck, laddybuck.”<br/><br/>“Thanks.”<br/><br/>He almost didn’t hear her whisper as he walked away.  “You’re going to need it.”<br/><br/><i>What was that?</i> he wondered as he stepped out the door.  He was starting to turn around to go back in and ask, when he crashed right in to someone - and then found himself swaying, abruptly dizzy, as the world did another odd ninety degree turnaround.<br/><br/>#<br/><br/>When Detective Greene crashed into her, Mayumi felt very much like cursing all her ancestors and the Greater Spirits.  Hadn’t she been thinking just a few hours ago that the connection to the wrongness was starting to appear less coincidence and more planned?  And now here was the detective who had been at the site of the first wrongness event, crashing into her, in circumstances that <i>felt</i> very much like manipulation.<br/><br/>Then the detective swayed dizzily, and Mayumi felt a touch of alarm.  Was he sick?<br/><br/>“Detective?  Are you all right?”<br/><br/>“Huh?”  Blinking, his eyes somewhat out of focus, the detective looked at her.  “Miss... Miyanobo?  I’m... just dizzy....”<br/><br/>There was a small - what did they call it, a parkette? - just a short distance away, with two benches.  Taking the detective’s arm, she tugged him along until they reached the first bench, then urged him to sit down.<br/><br/>The detective took a deep breath, then another, and a third, before he managed to look up at her with his eyes clear.  “Thank you, Miss Miyanobo,” he said politely... but Mayumi was kitsune, and could plainly see the suspicion in his gaze.<br/><br/>She gave no indication of that as she replied.  “You’re welcome, Detective.  I hope you don’t mind my inquiring what has happened.”<br/><br/>“I’m... not sure.”  He frowned thoughtfully.  “I was about to walk back into the cafe, bumped into you... and then everything seemed to go sideways.”<br/><br/>Well.  That sealed it.  Mayumi had never experienced it herself, of course, being kitsune and so a spirit already, but she’d heard from a couple of tanuki elders that to those humans sensitive to the spirits - which included those touched by spirits - things seemed that way when the Greater Spirits interfered.<br/><br/>But this was a human.  A detective human.  And spirit-touched or not, Native American heritage or not, Mayumi had the feeling that this particular human didn’t believe in spirits, and wouldn’t, even if she tried to prove it to him.  So she couldn’t exactly provide him with an explanation for what he’d felt.<br/><br/>“And... why am I telling you this?”<br/><br/>“Because you need to tell someone?” Mayumi offered.  Then she found herself stiffening involuntarily as once again, the feel of wrongness exploded in her senses.<br/><br/>It wasn’t as strong as yesterday afternoon, or even last night, but it was definitely there.<br/><br/>Breathing in, her nostrils flared as she scented the air.  Her senses weren’t quite as strong in human-form (except for vision, which was less near-sighted), but they were still much stronger than a human’s.<br/><br/>Next to her, she could smell the detective; confused, stressed, and <i>strongly</i> wolf-touched.  He must have had contact with whoever the wolf that spirit-touched him was, and recently.  She breathed in again, a bit deeper.  And yes, the musky scent was there; again, it was fainter, more diffused than it had been last night.<br/><br/><i>Inari, damn it, what do you mean for me to do?</i><br/><br/>Looking around, Mayumi’s eyes fell on a stringy-looking woman shambling down the sidewalk’s edge.  Her hair hung in hanks, she was dressed in so many shabby clothes that Mayumi was surprised she wasn’t fainting from the spring heat, and she smelled unwashed, much as the man last night had.<br/><br/>Mayumi wrinkled her nose unconsciously.  What <i>was</i> going on?  What exactly was the source of the wrongness, and why were the Greater Spirits involved?<br/><br/>And what did the wolf-touched police detective have to do with any of this?<br/><br/>“So, Miss Miyanobo.  This is quite a coincidence, meeting you here,” said detective mentioned, almost as though he’d known that she was thinking about him.<br/><br/>“Yes, I suppose so,” Mayumi replied - carefully not actually agreeing with him.  It was time to be the clever kitsune, and ensure that he didn’t learn the actual truth, without ever <i>lying</i> to him.  With the Greater Spirits involved, and obviously setting up some form of connection to the detective, lying would <i>not</i> be a good idea.  Many, many tales among both kitsune and tanuki warned of that.<br/><br/>“So, you’re visiting the city - and the country.  How do you find Toronto so far?”<br/><br/>Was he ‘making small talk’?  If so, why?  She knew there was some suspicion of their meeting being more than a coincidence, even if he would not believe the truth of it.<br/><br/>Whatever the reason, he would only grow more suspicious if she didn’t play along.<br/><br/>“It is... very different from what I am used to,” she admitted.  <i>In many ways.</i>  “I am accustomed to many more people, and more bicycles.  And older buildings, of a much different style from what you find here.”  <i>And small villages, still following the ancient ways, and earthquakes, and high hills and volcanoes....</i>  “I cannot say yet whether I like it or not, I’m afraid.  This is only my third full day here.”<br/><br/>“Hm.  If you don’t mind, Miss Miyanobo, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about what happened with Errol Lumir.”<br/><br/>Mayumi blinked in confusion at the sound of a name she’d never heard of.  “Who is--  Oh!” she exclaimed, as understanding dawned.  “Is that the man who collapsed yesterday?”  <i>Who <u>died</u> yesterday, right in front of me, and started this?</i><br/><br/>“Yes, it is.  Sorry, I forgot that you wouldn’t have known his name,” the detective replied.<br/><br/><i>Remember, you don’t know he’s dead.</i>  “How is he?” Mayumi asked, doing her best to sound genuinely interested.  Lying wasn’t okay - direct lies, at least - but deception <i>was</i> acceptable.  She was a kitsune, after all!<br/><br/>Apparently her ruse worked.  “I’m afraid he was pronounced dead at the hospital.”<br/><br/>“Oh, dear.  What about his family?  They must be devastated,” Mayumi offered in return.<br/><br/>Detective Greene gave her a grim smile.  “He didn’t have any family.”<br/><br/>“That’s a pity,” Mayumi continued.  “Family is important.”  Despite the fact that she <i>had</i> family, she’d never really felt she did until meeting Enilda and her children, only three days ago.  And even that was marred somewhat by her grandmother’s attitude.<br/><br/>“True enough.  Listen, I need to ask you... did you see anyone pass behind Mr. Lumir just before he collapsed?” the detective queried.<br/><br/>Mayumi blinked at the question.  <i>They think he was murdered?</i><br/><br/>Thinking back to that moment, she frowned slightly.  “Not... <i>just</i> before he collapsed.  Other than that, the only ones in the group from the bus who <i>didn’t</i> pass directly behind him were the boy you had doing - CPR, you called it? - and the girl who was with him.  They were ahead of him leaving the bus, and they turned south immediately, didn’t face him at all.  The other four all passed directly behind him at one point or another.  Why?”<br/><br/>He shrugged.  “I needed to know.  Thank you.  And thank you for earlier,” he added, standing back up.<br/><br/>Mayumi got up as well, not willing to hold the subordinate position.  The detective was taller than she was as it was; no need to let him look down on her further.  “You’re welcome.”<br/><br/>“But,” he continued, “I have to be getting back to the station, I’m afraid.”  An odd expression passed over his face: suspicion and confusion mixed uneasily together, as the hint of wolf in his spirit rose.  “I have a feeling we’ll be seeing each other again.”<br/><br/>“Quite possibly,” Mayumi admitted.  “Have a good day, then, Detective.”<br/><br/>“And you as well, Miss Miyanobo.”<br/><br/>Watching him walk away, steady again, Mayumi cursed under her breath.  <i>Wolf-touched.  Why do the Greater Spirits want me involved with a <u>wolf</u>-touched human?</i><br/><br/>She could still remember her favourite littermate, the one who played with her most often, and shared feeding time with her.  She’d enjoyed spending time with him, and they’d spoken to each other often of their dreams and the differences they felt from other animals.<br/><br/>And then one day, that companionship was gone; snatched from her (and their other littermates) by a hungry wolf.  She’d watched, frozen in fear, as the wolf had ripped out her littermate’s throat and begun eating him.<br/><br/>She couldn’t <i>hate</i> wolves for being what they were; many other kitsune and ordinary foxes met their ends that way.  But she could come close... and she did.<br/><br/>And now....<br/><br/><i>Oh, Inari, what am I to do now?</i></p>

<p>Brendan’s attention was taken up with monitoring the status of those survivors still not rescued - keeping a mental eye on the starscape in his mind - and providing basic triage for the ones who had been brought out.  He generally preferred to take a more active role in the rescues, but in a situation like this, where they didn’t have the dogs or any of the minor telepaths helping, his most important role was to monitor things - which meant not being in the thick of the action.  The only good thing about it was that it meant he’d been able to strip out of the Hazmat suit as soon as the site was verified as clear.<br/><br/>He’d just finished with the latest survivor - a woman who’d apparently hit her head on her kitchen counter when the earthquake had happened and been knocked unconscious - when he felt a brush against his mind.<br/><br/>Brendan stiffened in shock at the touch.  Another telepath was scanning him.<br/><br/>Another telepath who shouldn’t be anywhere near here.  Junction didn’t have any telepaths assigned to it - no reason to, as there was nothing here that would actually need a telepath - and anyway, the only other telepaths on Tethys were the minor telepaths also assigned to Search and Rescue.  Kerri was at Vanell with Epsilon Team, and the other two would still be asleep at this point.  They were certainly nowhere that Junction would be within their range.<br/><br/>Not to mention that the scan had been a mid-level one, and none of them were depth-readers....<br/><br/>Still keeping a mental eye on the survivors, Brendan reached out to scan the rest of the area again.  Nearby were the glows of the familiar minds of the team’s medical crew, the survivors they’d already rescued, and....<br/><br/>The brilliant blaze of another telepath’s mind.  With one thought at the surface of his mind: <i>Security Division agent Ryuunosuke Kitagawa - I need help.</i><br/><br/>The name wasn’t familiar, nor was the sense of the other’s mind.  Still....  Security.  Damn it.<br/><br/>Moving away from the bed the woman was lying on, Brendan headed for the large rock formation just on the far side of where the Search and Rescue tents had been set up.  He rounded the corner... and found himself staring in a combination of surprise and dismay.<br/><br/>Leaning heavily against one of the rocks was a man about an inch or two taller than Brendan, wearing Psi Department Greens with the red shoulder flashes of the Security Division....  Greens that were heavily tattered, with both sleeves torn to little more than shreds, and holed and stained with blood at his right thigh.  There was a piece of cloth tied around his leg at the area where the hole was, acting as a bandage - from the bits that were still the original cream colour, Brendan figured it was ripped from his uniform undershirt.<br/><br/>Black shoulder-length hair was hanging in the other man’s eyes, escaping from the small ponytail, and he looked exhausted, along with everything else.<br/><br/>“Ryuunosuke Kitagawa?” Brendan said cautiously.  This was definitely the other telepath - he didn’t make mistakes when it came to locating others’ minds - but with the condition he was in....<br/><br/>The man raised his head slightly, a metal square dangling from his left ear glinting in the light coming from the powerful searchlamps, and dazed hazel eyes blinked at Brendan, before he felt another scan brush against him - something that no ‘non-telepath’ would feel.<br/><br/><i>Yes, I’m the telepath you scanned,</i> he thought firmly.<br/><br/>Kitagawa’s shoulders relaxed slightly.  “Yeah,” he said hoarsely.  “You’re... Brendan Saunders?”<br/><br/>Brendan stiffened.  He had enough trouble with the Security Division as it was, from those who knew him... he didn’t need--<br/><br/>“I need you... to contact the commander... for me,” Kitagawa continued.<br/><br/>“What?” Brendan blurted.  That was not what he’d been expecting... although why he should have been expecting a man who was obviously injured to rail at him about the Security Division’s grievances with him, he didn’t know....  Not enough sleep, and too much death from stupidity, he figured after a moment.  Not terribly good excuses, but valid ones....<br/><br/>And there was an injured person in front of him, Security Division or not, who needed help.  “Come on, I’ll take you to the first aid station, we can get you seen to...” Brendan started, reaching out to grip Kitagawa’s right arm - judging from the large black bruise coming out on the left one, touching that wouldn’t be a good idea, and this way he could also provide support for the wounded leg.<br/><br/>“Wait,” Kitagawa objected.  “Have to--”  He broke off, breathing heavily.<br/><br/>Brendan frowned.  “Try to get it to the surface of your mind, and I’ll scan you - I’m not a depth-reader.”<br/><br/>“Right.”<br/><br/>Reaching out again, Brendan started reading him.<br/><br/><i>Security for a lab, classified, on Loki... was attacked by space pirates looking for something... managed to escape... Tethys closest available, found your name in the Department files as assigned.  Arrived, got jumped and grabbed by bully-boys... they brought me out here because they thought I wouldn’t be found when they killed me.  Escaped, got shot in the leg while doing that, then got caught in the quake....  They knew Junction was around, figured I could at least find a telepath here if not you--</i><br/><br/>The thoughts abruptly drifted off into incoherence, and Brendan muttered a quiet curse as Kitagawa collapsed against him, unconscious.  “You couldn’t have waited until we were at least in sight of the aid tent?” he hissed.<br/><br/>Crouching slightly, he hefted the other telepath over his shoulders in a fireman’s carry, grimacing as something hard dug into his shoulder, and slowly made his way back around the formation to the S-and-R staging area.</p>

<p>A reworking of last year's concept: </p>
<p>The evil empire has been in power for too long. Nonhumans would be treated like second-class citizens, except that that would involve being citizens at all, and it's finally time for someone to draw the line.</p>
<p>Which is all well and good for the rebels and the downtrodden, but what does that mean for the men who work in the Dark Tower?</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/persekore/novels/before-the-tower-fell/stats,November 2015,"
<p>“Lord Solako,” Olenn said, once they were off of the padded training mats. “I see that no one has told you: these training rooms are for soldiers. If you’re interested in a morning workout, there are several guest chambers two levels up from here. I’m sure you’ll find that they have everything to meet your needs.”</p>
<p>“I was told that I might find you here,” Solako said as though Olenn hadn’t spoken. “The young men at the front said that you usually practiced in one of these rooms. It only took three tries before I found you.”</p>
<p>He looked, if not exactly pleased with himself, then certainly well satisfied.</p>
<p>Olenn unhooked the swordbelt from around his hips, and stowed the blade on the long rack set out for the purpose. Lengths of toweling cloth were set along the top, and Olenn took a moment to wipe his face and the back of his neck, then take a cup of chilled water from the cask by the door. Lord Solako stood to one side, the look of satisfaction slowly fading from his features as Olenn failed to address him. He should just let the man stew, Olenn thought. None of the Thirteen Ministers would stand for that kind of behavior, even Major-General Adren.</p>
<p>“My assistant didn’t contact your house to arrange an appointment?”<br/>“Perhaps,” Solako said. “I didn’t ask. I woke early, and it seemed like the best idea was to come here and find you myself.”</p>
<p>Olenn sighed. He couldn’t just ignore the man. His job was to look at any given situation, comb through it until he could find the good where everyone else saw disaster, find reason for celebration when other people gave up hope. He was good at it, had always been considered a little bit too optimistic. But it wasn’t about optimism or endless cheer. It was about taking the long view, and understanding what people really needed.</p>
<p>And what Olenn didn’t need right now was a nobleman with a grudge.</p>
<p>So he gestured to the door, and fell in step beside Lord Solako as he led him out of the training room and into the Citadel’s circular outer hallway.</p>
<p>“I’ve always said,” Solako was saying, “the best way to get anywhere in life is to be proactive. I’ve tried sending messages and runners, but it’s not really surprising that nothing’s happened yet. No, the best thing to do is come myself, so here I am.”</p>
<p>“And what is this problem you’ve been told that I can help you with?” Olenn asked. He couldn’t take Solako up to his office, there was no way he was showing this man where to find his private workspace.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Volice Solanko didn’t seem to need a formalized environment any more than he needed an official invitation.</p>
<p>He made a pained face.</p>
<p>“I’m here as a representative of a larger community,” he said, folding his arms behind his back as he walked. “The residents of Aspenvale have been trying to figure out how to solve this dilemma for some time now, and I was ultimately chosen to bring this to the Citadel’s immediate attention.”</p>
<p>“‘This’ being …”</p>
<p>“As you may have heard,” Solako said, “a large group of us recently elected to move to this place from Jitare.” He paused, as though expecting some kind of reaction. After a moment Olenn nodded, evidently the appropriate response. “We were told that our neighborhood would be ready for habitation six months ago, but when we arrived we were forced to spend almost five weeks living out of local inns until construction on the manor houses was complete.”</p>
<p>Olenn frowned.</p>
<p>“And construction still hasn’t been completed?”</p>
<p>This wasn’t terribly uncommon. Nobles of low status tended to move to one of the ancillary cities in the empire, assuming that their cosmopolitan experience would translate into higher rank or better prestige. They tended to find themselves disappointed, at least in Nemis, where the local population’s history and traditions hadn’t quite been stamped out as well as in other places. Little things like procedural delays were common, a way of letting these newly landed nobles that they weren’t quite as important as they thought they were. Six months, though, that was pushing the limits.</p>
<p>But Solako shook his head.</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” he said. “We moved in four and a half months ago. It took them another three weeks to connect the fountains, but one expects that sort of thing out on the frontiers.”</p>
<p>Olenn raised an eyebrow. Again, Solako paused, but when no response came he eventually continued.</p>
<p>“For the first few months, everything was lovely, let me assure you. Wonderful masonry, beautiful avenues. We started building a real community. Our first child was born two and a half weeks ago.”</p>
<p>“Congratulations,” Olenn said. Listening to the man talk, he might have thought he was founding a city of his own, rather than simply taking residence in one.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we quickly found ourselves disappointed by our situation. Strangers began coming into the fountain square. Peddlers, beggars, that sort.” Solako waved an eloquent hand. “Some people have taken to charging messengers and errand-boys a fee to leave Aspenvale, or a fee to enter. Sometimes, they’ll throw a punch or two, though no one has died. Yet. And urchins started climbing the walls, running wild without any sort of supervision, and of course, no matter how hard we tried we couldn’t keep our children from mingling with them. You should hear some of the words my niece has started using!”</p>
<p>“It’s difficult raising children in a city,” Olenn said, with what he hoped was a neutral expression.</p>
<p>Solako shook his head.</p>
<p>“If that weren’t bad enough, it appears that there is a factory upwind of Aspenvale. The smoke pours in at all hours, and the temple …”</p>
<p>“Temple?” Olenn blinked.</p>
<p>“If you can even call it that,” Solako said. “One of those rustic pagan wind-cages that whistle whenever a breeze blows at the wrong angle.” He eyed Olenn, taking in his height and the color of his hair and eyes, then sniffed. “Well, I’m sure you’d know all about that.”</p>
<p>“A man in my position can’t afford to be too devout,” Olenn said. It was one of those lines that seemed to mean whatever the listener wanted it to mean; he had a collection of those saved up for special occasions.</p>
<p>Just ahead, the corridor opened up around a circular ironwork construction, two men standing on guard at the doors. The lift system in the Citadel was mind-bogglingly complex, with no one lift spanning the entire tower’s height. In order to get from the ground floor to his office on the thirty-second floor, Olenn had to take five different lifts, as well as three staircases, and only the lowermost levels had any sort of informative signage. If you didn’t know what lift to take, the message was, you didn’t deserve to take one.</p>
<p>The number of lifts also meant that the zephyrs who operated them were in short supply. Each lift station, therefore, also served as a little lounging area, with benches or chairs to relax in while one waited for the mages to arrive. Olenn led Lord Solako to a pair of such armchairs, letting himself settle in and crossing his legs. Solako remained standing a moment later, then sat with a dubious frown.</p>
<p>“General Sundar,” he said, “I’m sure you can understand the difficulty of my position here. Of our positions. We have picked up our lives and moved everything we have to Nemis Kiceri. We were promised certain things in return, and the city’s inability to make good on those promises could be damaging to its reputation. We don’t want that to happen any more than you do, I’m sure. We just want to live our lives, quietly, without having to worry that we’ll be burgled in the night or have our children stolen out from under us.”</p>
<p>The man actually looked sincere.</p>
<p>It was hard to believe that anyone could say the sort of thing he did with a straight face, much less the earnest intensity Olenn thought he was seeing. Was he actually oblivious to the fact that he was threatening Olenn? Telling the Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Management for the Nemis Kiceri that he was willing to slander the Palatine and - incidentally - end Olenn’s career while he was at it? There was entitlement, and then there was …</p>
<p>Well, in the end it didn’t matter anyway.</p>
<p>Olenn set his hands down on the arms of his chair and tilted his head at the other man.</p>
<p>“I’ll do my best to help in any way I can,” he said, heart sinking as he said the words. There went his Commemoration. “Is there anything in particular you have in mind?”</p>

<p>Life under the thumb of a despotic overlord isn't necessarily as bad as everyone makes it out to be, or at least, that's what Olenn Sundar always thought. With a comfortable upper-management position in the Spire, a pleasant if slightly bizarre relationship with his coworkers, and a roof that didn't even leak, he thought he had it made. When a new tavern opens up nearby, however, Olenn finds himself wondering if maybe his litle haven of security is quite as perfect as he thought - or if, just maybe, there might be something more than stability to aspire to.</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/persekore/novels/the-hammer-s-boon/stats,November 2014,"
<p>Olenn leaned his elbows heavily against the desk.</p>
<p>“We need to be careful,” he said. “Things aren’t necessarily the way they seem … and even if they are, acting too quickly or too enthusiastically could be the end of everything. Just because some people are angry and other people are scared of that anger doesn’t mean that we have a real rebellion brewing in the city.”</p>
<p>“That’s what they’ll say it is, though,” a wry voice said from behind, and Gadrid’s feet came up to settle in their customary place on his desk. “Anger is dissent, and dissent is rebellion. If people are calling out their neighbors, it’s only a matter of weeks before it amounts to something more than interrogations.”</p>
<p>Jurish stepped off into his office, reappearing almost instantly with a second earthenware mug, a second slice of faintly steaming pie fresh out of the emberbox he pretended he didn’t have installed in one of the room’s multitudinous filing cabinets. Gadrid accepted the mug with a sigh of satisfaction, having long-since abandoned any attempt to convince the newest member of their little team that he really didn’t need to bribe them anymore. Olenn had pointed out that the bribes had never been necessary in the first place and both men had stared at him like he had temporarily taken leave of his senses.</p>
<p>The offers of breakfast continued, and eventually both senior men came to accept that it was just part of the new natural order of things.</p>
<p>Gadrid took a sip of his tea, eyes closing, an expression somewhere between satisfaction and anguish on his face. It took him hours to wake up properly, and he claimed that the only way he could get any real work done before the sun was well and truly over the horizon was to pretend he was asleep, and it was all a dream.</p>
<p>“You’re talking about Marisale Wist?” Gadrid asked, cocking his head to where Jurish had been. The pale man now standing some five feet away nodded, explained what he’d told Olenn with the same bleak note in his voice.</p>
<p>“Something’s brewing,” he said. “It’s worse than we thought.”</p>
<p>“Technically,” Gadrid said, “ it can’t be. We decided last night that we were expecting the worst. Technically, it can’t get any worse than that, so we should be congratulating ourselves on the accuracy of our predictions.”</p>
<p>“While the city goes up in flames,” Olenn said.</p>
<p>“While the city goes up in flames.”</p>
<p>Jurish ran a hand through his hair, then finally succumbed to the lure of Olenn’s chair. He sat delicately, which Olenn was coming to recognize was the equivalent of most people slumping carelessly, of Gadrid’s feet on the files.</p>
<p>“It’s probably just a handful of irritated conscripts,” Gadrid said, eyes still closed. “We’re coming up on the anniversary of the mine. The families of the victims have always gathered together, and they’ve always made other people nervous. Nobody likes getting too close to that kind of tragedy, and it makes them suspicious. The gatherings of wildkin might just be relatives coming together in a time of grief.”</p>
<p>“There are rules against that,” Jurish said quietly. “Unsanctioned gatherings of five or more non-residents …”</p>
<p>Olenn waved a hand.</p>
<p>“If you take that kind of thing too seriously, people will get up in arms,” he said. “The new men and women always take a few years to really understand that. You can’t put fifty thousand people together and then tell them they need to file a permit before they have a picnic, not if you’re also putting them to work in your mines or on your roads. They keep their gatherings quiet, and we don’t bring our hammer down on people who just want to roast a pidgeon or two and mourn the loss of their loved ones.”</p>
<p>“Do they know that?” Jurish asked, but it sounded rhetorical.</p>
<p>“We have to do something,” Olenn said. “We can’t just sit here and do nothing in response to the kind of allegations we’ve been receiving. If it were just patrols and watch commanders, we could pretend the rumors had no legs, but someone showing up at the spire? That news will spread.”</p>
<p>“We can increase patrols,” Gadrid suggested. “Double the watch patterns in conscript quarters, and tell people to start paying attention to the sorts of things they normally let slide. If there’s any truth to the reports, there should be some sign of it. Conscripts aren’t exactly known for being geniuses.”</p>
<p>“The problem,” Olenn said, “will be in not igniting the exact sort of protest we’re trying to prevent. If scripts start seeing sabers appearing around every corner, even the ones who haven’t done something wrong are going to start assuming that we’re watching them, and that’ll make them anxious. Anxious people look a lot like suspicious ones, and I can guarantee that if it goes on for any real length of time, one of ours will overreact. Someone will have the wrong look on his face at the wrong time, and he’ll end up dead. The next thing we know, we’ll have a martyr.”</p>
<p>“They’re only martyrs if the people know what happened.”</p>
<p>Olenn and Gadrid both looked over at Jurish, was sitting perfectly straight-backed in Olenn’s chair. There was a ball of paper held between his fingers, and he was slowly crinkling it in on itself, then lightly feathering it out again, in, and out.</p>
<p>“Bring in the shadow watch?” Gadrid said, taking the hand away from his eyes to give Jurish an incredulous look. “Over a bunch of rumors? That’s like sending in a team of firehounds because a goodwife saw a rat.”</p>
<p>Pale eyes gazed steadily back in a paling face; Jurish was uncertain about what he was saying, but he wasn’t backing down.</p>
<p>“If the goodwife is the mistress of the Emperor’s kitchens,” he said, “and the rat is seen in a time of plague, then maybe it is time to send a team of firehounds. Better to lose one storehouse than the Emperor.”</p>
<p>“We’re not at that stage yet,” Olenn said firmly. Jurish looked like he was going to protest, and Olenn shook his head. “You’re new to the city, you haven’t learned how it works yet. Nothing’s as simple as it seems, not even the conscripts. They’re smarter than people want to give them credit for, and their lives are more complicated than most people understand. Underestimating the wildkin is even worse - they might not be human, but they’re not beasts. If grieving widows start disappearing, they won’t sit idly by. If grieving widows start disappearing and nobody understands why, people who are already angry might start feeling like they should be doing something about it.”</p>

<p>In the city of Madrine, Asha Fray is a young socialite working to earn a rank as one of the newstellers by tracking down rumours and collecting informants. Her carefully-constructed plans go off the rails one night, though, when a friend comes to her with a problem: Nicelle's father is missing and she can't convince the constables that he hasn't just been delayed on a trip. What begins as a simple fact-finding mission quickly spins out of Asha's control, and she finds herself caught up in the middle of exactly the sort of adventure she might otherwise have wanted to collect and report. <br/><br/>Across the strait in Avial, Brennan Jacquerin's way of life is not nearly as stable as he thought it was. When his order turns down the requested assassination of Eshadrin Madrine, a visiting diplomat's daughter, the young assassin suddenly finds his entire world falling down around him. Refusing to be denied, the lord who placed the hit takes matters into his own hands, and Brenn's mentor is the first casualty in the conflict. His quest to avenge her is complicated slightly by deep-seated corruption within the order of assassins, and the sudden appearance of menacing foreigners wielding magics everyone had assumed were long-dead. What first seemed like a simple if brutal act of angry retaliation quickly proves to be much more complicated, and Brenn is right in the middle of it all.</p>

<p>""Pride,"" she whispered. ""What will you do?""<br/><br/>Instead of replying, Brenn shifted the hand under her arm to circle her torso. His other arm swept down to catch the girl at the knees, sweeping her up into his arms. She was more solid than she looked, but still a relatively little weight. <br/><br/>Hopefully, little enough. <br/><br/>""I'll keep you alive,"" he told her, managing somehow to enjoy the melodrama of the statement. It was a pretty image, the dashing hero standing braced on a balcony, trembling girl in his arms, while a menacing evil was held in tenuous stasis a dozen feet away. <br/><br/>Except that the caster wasn't held even tenuously, the girl was paralyzed with the fear she was obviously trying to keep from dominating her, and Brenn's heroic plan might well get them all killed.<br/><br/>Well, you worked with what you've got, and what Brenn had was a hand mirror, a terrified socialite, and a night-shrouded forty foot drop to the nearest roof, three hundred feet to the Beaches stretching out from the base of the Bluffs to the distant sea. If he thought too much about what he was doing, the difficulty and the things that could go wrong, he'd lose his nerve. And if he gave her too much time to think about the same things, he wasn't prepared to bet she wouldn't just turn herself over to the caster, who at least might have the decency to end things quickly.<br/><br/>With a convulsive motion that pulled at all of the lacerations on his upper body, Brenn threw Eshadrin over the balcony. <br/><br/>She let out a little shriek of terror, and then she fell.<br/><br/>An instant later Brenn was up on the railing angling his little mirror to catch the image of the tumbling girl before she was lost in the shadows below. She jerked in the air as he managed to loop a reeved cord around her, eliciting a second pitiful sound; around him, Brenn could hear the noises of windows opening and closing as some people stuck their heads out to investigate the disruption, and others more sensibly decided they wanted absolutely nothing to do with it. <br/><br/>The reeving wasn't strong enough to arrest her motion completely, but as he caught her with a second cord, then a net, her frantic plummet became a more controlled drop. Bracing himself with a hand tight around the balcony railing, the one holding the mirror extended out as though holding onto a thick rope - yes, guestures were amateur, but sometimes they were also a really useful way of reinforcing will when lighting, stress, or bloodloss were making it difficult to focus. He lowered her rapidly, watching with increasing concern as she became harder and harder to spot the farther down she went. If he lost sight of her completely before she was a safe falling distance ...<br/><br/>But he didn't, although it was close. The white of her nightgown was little more than an indistinct speck in his mirror when she finally touched the ground, and he'd been feeling her pace increasing incrementally the farther she moved away from him and into the gloom, but he never lost it, not completely. She might be a bit sore, depending on how she landed, but she was still alive.<br/><br/>And that was all the time or attention Brenn could give the girl, for now. <br/><br/>The caster broke completely free of his limited binding an instant after Brenn released the reeving on Eshadrin, and he saw the shadows beneath him writhe and twist, dark tendrils reaching up to wrap around his ankles, binding him to the railing on which he crouched. The little throwing knife reappeared in Brenn's hand and he sliced at one of the strands though he had no idea whether or not simple steel would work on shadowstuff.<br/><br/>It did, the blade parting the strange substance like he was trying to slice through a child's padded leather ball. He jerked his ankle away before something else could reach out to snare him, but even as he did the tendrils twining around his other leg jerked abruptly and his vision suddenly tipped wildly to one side as Brenn was pulled sharply down from the railing. <br/><br/>There was a blinding flash of pain as the back of his head crashed into the stone balcony, the relatively dull general agony of skull against hard granite utterly eclipsed by sensation of the head wound he'd incurred earlier dragging against the sharp corner. The world went white, then black, then a blurry kind of red while. His stomach heaved in sympathy and protest, but he'd known better than to eat before working, even when he'd thought 'work' would amount to little more than raking leaves and twiddling his thumbs. After a horrible, nauseating moment, things began to settle again.<br/><br/>He saw the spear of blackness coming at him just in time to throw himself out of the way, although the sudden motion immediately negated the slight ebbing of his headache. Two more followed on its heels, gouging chunks out of the balcony when they missed his flesh, and he misjudged the angle of the fourth, taking a slash to the thigh for his trouble. Brenn yanked the door off of its hinges with a monumental effort of will and hurled it with more brutality than precision at the caster, buying himself a couple of seconds reprieve, but it was becoming clear that he wasn’t going to escape this situation alive if he kept trying to play the game by these rules.</p>

<p>“You’re not very good at this.” <br/><br/>From this angle, Caden could see the window was unlatched, the wood of the frame touching but not flush against itself. Her bare foot settled into his palms, delicate and cold from the ground; he waited to feel one of her hands rest for balance against his shoulder, and then boosted her up into the air.<br/><br/>She struggled for a moment, fingers slipping on the window frame - it hadn’t been used in some time, Caden saw now, the hinges were rusted and reluctant to move. Then something caught, and with a creaking sound that seemed distressingly loud against the relative tranquility of this estate garden, the window tilted up. Another moment of scrambling to find purchase on the sill, and her weight was up off of his hands and she was through.<br/><br/>Leaving Caden standing very alone in the garden.<br/><br/>There was a sound from behind him, faint but growing nearer. Voices, half a dozen men at least from the sound of it, coming from the direction of the courtyard. Damon would be hearing it as well, Caden knew. He hoped his brother was where he was meant to be, that his scheme was going off exactly as he hoped. That, in the simplest and most honest of terms, there would be no call to summon the aid of the lookout. That concern only lasted for a moment, though, as the second, more pressing implication caught up to him; whether or not the girl had been telling the truth, whether or not the nature of her indiscretion was such as would exclude him from suspicion of guilt, he was still lurking around well off of the public road, in a place in which he had absolutely no business being. The main courtyard, that could be explained well enough, but a garden? Dark and secluded, no one could find themselves here without some effort, and that enough would be grounds for interest. The proximity to the girl would only heighten that interest.<br/><br/>He hoped, suddenly, that that hadn’t been her plan all along - though if it had been … Caden smiled slowly.<br/><br/>And shook his head once more, trying to clear it from the sudden heady fog of potential appreciation. If it was her intention, he was quite possibly a dead man. The window was still open, the rusty hinge now working to Caden’s advantage as it kept the frame from closing on itself. It was high, several feet above his head, and small … but he was slim, if reasonably tall, and deftness of body had never been one of his weaknesses.<br/><br/>He moved back onto the path, and hten sprinted forward, one foot bracing against the wall itself and launching him up one step, two, until his fingertips could make a pass for the sill. The wood was strong, barely giving under the sudden application of his weight, and he pulled himself up in the same motion to roll smoothly into the room.<br/><br/>And then, immediately, into a large pot full of gardening tools.<br/><br/>“Goddamnit!”<br/><br/>Caden sprang out as quickly as he’d fallen in, cursing, one hand clapped tightly against the series of small lacerations that had just opened up on his thigh. Blood welled under his fingertips as he looked around the space.<br/><br/>It was larger than it had appeared from the outside, a loft that was clearly being used for the less frequently required, bags of seed and mulch, smocks and pots and tools fortunately devoid of rust, other shapes inadequately illuminated by the minimal light that was filtering in through the open window. The floor was wooden, dusty, and a ladder in the corner led down to the shed’s lower section and whatever mysteries it contained.<br/><br/>The girl had had her back to him as he came in, was working at something Caden hadn’t seen before, which was no resolving itself into a coiled length of rope. She spun as he came crashing down, the knotted rope in one hand held like some sort of a weapon, and the sight of the furious warrior in her delicate curls and bare feet made him snort with laughter before he could control the impulse. The pain of his landing temporarily forgotten, he stretched up to pull the window shut, and then turned back to her.<br/><br/>She had lowered the rope by the time he did so, her face relaxing, her shoulders lowering.<br/><br/>“I was trying to find a way to help you up,” she said, somehow managing to layer a reproach through her tone underneath amusement and the fleeting aftereffects of nerves. “I didn’t think you’d be able to make it on your own …”<br/><br/>“You’re not the only one with some skills,” Caden replied with a smug sort of shrug. She smiled at that, and he felt his heart jump with the simple expression.<br/><br/>“Well, I noticed that much. Not very many people can keep up with me - and most people aren’t brave enough to try.”<br/><br/>Caden raised an eyebrow.<br/><br/>“This happens to you a lot, then? Pulling strangers into mad escape plans against their better interests?”<br/><br/>She flushed, and sank down in a smooth swirl of orange silk to sit neatly on the coil of rope. Hand pressed firmly once more over his thigh, Caden moved over close enough to be able to see her in the limited light, sitting down cross-legged two feet away from her.<br/><br/>She was shaking her head.<br/><br/>“No,” came the response, and then a sigh. “No, it’s never happened before, and I hope it will never happen again.” Her gaze had been fixed on him since she turned; it changed now, softening somehow, as though she were seeing him now rather than simply watching him. “I’m sorry, I got caught up in all of this, and I caught you up with me. It was brave of you, and I think kind as well, to help me - whether or not I bullied you into it.”<br/><br/>Caden chuckled.<br/><br/>“Oh, bravery had nothing to do with it.”<br/><br/>She cocked her head, and he grinned.<br/><br/>“It’s a little known secret, but all men are fundamentally incapable of refusing a beauty in need.” Her eyebrows rose, sensual mouth opening, but he shook his head, raised a hand to cut her off. “I know how that could sound - two ways, actually, and they’re both wrong. It’s not bravery, even though it could seem like it, because we don’t see it as a choice. You’re only brave if you go against danger willingly, or put aside your fear. If it’s the only option you have, you’re just a bit of a fool … or are secretly hoping that the maiden in question will reward you for your troubles in some mysterious way.” His tone dropped as he said that last, and Caden shook his head.<br/><br/>She rose to the bait, leaning forward - her dress fell forward as she did so, revealing even in the dim light, the top curve of her breast, and Caden forced himself not to stare for fear that she would notice and pull away.<br/><br/>“You’re not one of those kinds, though.”<br/><br/>“Of course not!”<br/><br/>“Because you’ve had so many girls that you don’t have to hope.”<br/><br/>“Now that’s not fair!” Caden threw his hands up quickly between them, as though it might protect him from the spur thrown. “I didn’t mean it that way, you’re just trying to throw me off again so I’ll ignore the fact that this entire mess is your fault, and brave or not I am a nice man.”<br/><br/>The silence that stretched between them was pregnant, heavy in the darkness. Her eyes had very long lashes, and they were very thick, seemed to act as a shield between her and the world around her - or at the very least, from Caden. Wherever the guards were, he couldn’t hear them any longer, and it seemed as he sat there, that they were the only people in the universe.<br/><br/>She blinked.<br/><br/>“I’m … Eltianne,” she said slowly, and then the moment shattered. There was a thud from outside, a muttered curse and the sound of heavy footsteps as the patrol of guardsmen he had heard earlier blundered past. They didn’t sound very well trained, probably the city guards unlucky enough to be assigned a nighttime post rather than the private men of the Estate. Damon would be fine, then. And from the way the girl - Eltianne - tensed and then sagged in visible relief, so would she.<br/><br/>“I’m Eltianne,” she said again, her tone different this time, lighter and clearer.<br/><br/>“Caden,” he returned, reaching out a hand which she took without hesitation. Their palms touched and for that instant he could feel her, her strengths and her weaknesses, a fleeting brush of her very spirit. If he wanted, he could use that, use anything he could feel and with a bit of effort several things he couldn’t. Some might consider it an appropriate response, given what she’d done, getting him caught up in her affairs.<br/><br/>He pulled his hand back quickly, and saw her eyes widen.<br/><br/>“You’re a Thief.”<br/><br/>He was laughing again before he could stop himself, at the mild outrage in her tone and the surprise on her face.<br/><br/>“Do I have to remind you which of us is currently hiding in a toolshed?”<br/><br/>“Both of us,” Eltianne retorted quickly, but something in her face gave as she conceded the point. Caden shrugged.<br/><br/>“There’s nothing wrong with being a thief,” he said, a bit defensively. “So long as you don’t do anything wrong with it. Nothing any different than being good with a blade, or liking pretty things. Or whatever it is you just couldn’t resist doing …”<br/><br/>“Do you really think it’s that easy?” The eyelashes were down again, her wall thrown up in full - if amused - force.<br/><br/>“Why wouldn’t it be?” His grin was a challenge, thrown lightly, but she met his regard with a serious stare again, seeming to seriously consider the question before she dropped her gaze to the floor.<br/><br/>“Nothing’s ever that easy,” Eltianne said. “If it is, you’re doing something wrong, or someone else is, and either way someone’s bound to get hurt.”<br/><br/>Her voice had grown soft; Caden slid closer to her on the floor to hear. He ducked his head to find her eyes again, frowning at her.<br/><br/>“I didn’t mean to …” He paused, suddenly feeling awkward. For the first time, he seemed to realise the nature of the situation. The rush of adrenaline had faded, his breathing was coming normally now, and the so easily dismissed thought of Damon and his job suddenly started sounding like a bell in the back of his mind, a job left abandoned. There would be consequences to that, whether or not it was convenient in this moment to acknowledge them. And Eltianne, for all her whimsy and her cloak of mysterious, free-spirited sensuality, had done something to someone that had been serious enough to send her fleeing, seeking the aid of the first stranger she had stumbled upon. The stranger who had helped to hide her, who was now sitting here.<br/><br/>Who knew better, on every other day, than to put himself at risk for the pretty smile of a stranger, however insistent she might have been.<br/><br/>He could have refused her, or done any number of things to keep himself out of this situation. He could even have done the opposite of this, turned her in to the guardsmen running along behind. A Thief could always use the goodwill of local law enforcement, whether or not they were planning on breaking any laws. Turning in someone who was legitimately up to no good went a long way toward proving someone’s goodwill.<br/><br/>It wasn’t too late now, the same shred of rational self-interest. The guards weren’t far away, and they would have to be moving slowly while they searched. If Caden tried, if he hurried, he could catch them. If he stole the girl’s strength to do so, left her weak and fatigued, he could do it in half the time and make sure she wasn’t able to escape …<br/><br/>But he wasn’t going to do that. Caden wasn’t a man easily moved to spontenaiety, whatever the events of the evening might have been inclined to suggest. And given that, given his position, the only thing worse than abandoning all reason to play tag-along to a youthful femme fatale was to abandon her spontaneously, with little to no knowledge of who she was, or what sort of steps she might be inclined to take in retaliation for such abandonment. They’d shaken hands, and he had know way of knowing what that might have meant for her, what measure of him she might have taken, what advantage she might have pulled for herself.<br/><br/>So he held his gaze steady, waited for her eyes to lift to meet his own, and forced himself not to shrug awkwardly back from the moment and the mood his response was creating.<br/><br/>“I don’t want to asking questions where I don’t belong, but under the circumstances I think it’s fair to say I belong pretty much everywhere.” Caden tried to keep his voice low and gentle, and was reasonably sure he failed even as he spoke. Whatever he did manage to convey, however, was enough to spark the fire back in her eyes, if it had ever left.<br/><br/>She tossed her hair, an imperious gesture that looked well-practiced to Caden’s marginally experienced eyes.<br/><br/>“Is a Thief really the sort of man who should be asking?” she challenged.<br/><br/>Caden felt the smile fall off of his face.<br/><br/>“It’s more polite asking what I need to know than it is just taking the answer for myself,” he retorted quickly, without thinking. “And someone who knows so much about us should be well aware that not all Thieves are nice enough to give their companions a choice about whether or not to answer them. Many would just take the knowledge for themselves, leave you stranded up here not even knowing what you’d done.” Of course it was illegal, but it was so damned hard to prove guilt in that sort of matter that most Delvers got away with it with hardly any effort. Eltianne seemed aware of this; she bristled further, and he hastened to continue before she could lash out in fear, or worse, summon some sort of moral high ground. “You didn’t have to decide to bring me along in all of this, and I’m sorry if I’m not quite the adoring dreamboat you were hoping to snag out of this. Maybe if you stopped assuming that every man you wander into is automatically going to swoon over you, you wouldn’t end up having to hide in a toolshed and answer questions from one who can actually stand up for himself.”<br/><br/>He was breathing heavily at the end, and felt heat in his face - the dark became a blessing, then, a chance that she might not see and judge and undermine him. Unfortunately, as she drew back away from him it was similarly impossible to tell whether she was hiding from his masterful onslaught or -<br/><br/>“And you, mister Master Thief?”<br/><br/>Or … not.<br/><br/>Caden cringed involuntarily, half expecting her to come at him with fists to match the edge in her voice. She stood, just short enough to be able to reach full height in this small space where Caden had been forced to slump his shoulders, and therefore just tall enough to seem to loom over him. There was a presence to her, in such confined quarters, the long waves of her hair seeming almost like tendrils reaching out into the darkness toward him. Her back was almost completely turned toward the window, a blanket of shadow covering her face completely, and suddenly all of the silly stories that people told about the evil spirit women of the night seemed to make just a little bit more sense than they ever had.<br/><br/>It was only when she spoke, when that very real emotion laced her words, that the illusion wavered and fell away.<br/><br/>“You, with your … your casual little slouch and that grin, like you’ve seen it all and done better. Life’s just one giant adventure for you, isn’t it? Nothing really matters, a girl needs help so let’s just take this along for the ride with everything else, and when it doesn’t go quite the way you’d like, you’ve got magic to make it all better.” She gesticulated expressively with one hand, narrowly avoiding knocking over a rake that was propped unevenly against the wall. “Never mind that some of us can’t do that whenever we’d like. That maybe if I tell you what’s going on we’ll just both be in more danger? So while I’m not quite as font of being stared at like some sort of object as you seem to think I am, it really would be so much nicer if you’d just gaze adoringly for a moment or two and then get out of my life and leave me in peace!”<br/><br/>“You’ve … never been in trouble before, have you?”</p>

<p>Humanity, inevitably, destroyed the planet. At least, they did so enough that the apocalypse might as well have happened in 2012, when everyone thought it was going to. Fossil fuel abuse and expulsion of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere cause enough damage and division to break the global nation that had formed to combat those selfsame fears.  The deliberate catastrophic meltdown of nuclear reactors across the globe by a radical element was the final nail in that particular coffin.<br/><br/>Gradually, three factions emerge from the chaos. At the top sit the privileged few - the executives of a multinational corporation that had the money and the means to survive the devastation, albeit in a different form. While their employees are down to earth, the executives live in a bubble of hope. The common man, however, is downtrodden and abused, and the workers have risen up in rebellion. While not necessarily organised, they do answer to a basic authority. Aside from both, and yet against both, lies a vicious mercenary group, determined to enforce their view of order upon the world.<br/><br/>All wish for a better place, and all strive for it in their own way, but those ways are not compatible.<br/><br/>The world, once divided, must unite; once united, must divide. Thus begins the story of the Three Kingdoms, as told by Luo Guanzhong. Once Divided is a sci-fi, post-apocalyptic retelling of that ancient story.</p>

<p>For as long as they can remember, the other Kenderleys silently questioned their patriarch; his short temper, his spur-of-the-moment decisions, yet he was far too successful in his role and popular with commoners. There was also no legal mechanism for removing him from power without his consent or his demise, and whoever dared attempt the second wouldn't be popular with the citizenry if they succeeded.</p>
<p>But when Jonnecht's impulsiveness and temper finally lead the empire toward embarrassment, various family members begin to wonder if this has gone on long enough. Can anyone trust any other not to scream treason? Can they work to do something about the mad King Jonnecht before things get much worse for everybody?</p>

<p> </p>
<p>It was not the day after the victory celebration, nor the week after it, but General Conrad was still in Bayrock, the Western side of the Kenderley Army united with the Eastern. At this point, he would not choose to move, but would eventually when instructed. There was good reason for his side of the Army to stay here in the capital, where it could easily be dispatched to reinforce the Eastern half, and Conrad sometimes wondered if he ever would leave this place.</p>
<p>At least it made for better surrounds if one liked to get drunk. The smell of yellow rock and belching mountains gave way to the salt of the Trade Waters, and the reek of fresh caught fish in the markets.</p>
<p>Bayrock was, arguably, the heart of the known world, and the world had a healthy heart. There were signs of age, but constant renewal. There was no dread here, for no hostile Army had reached this place in a terribly long time, far beyond living memory; enemies were far out of reach by land, and the Kenderley Navy had sufficient supremacy at sea that pirates off this coast were now unheard of, let alone enemies hoping to move their armies that way and make landfall. Thus the energy of Bayrock was far different than the unease of the Valley of Garnecht, where old enemies slumbered next door, or Lonn's Ford and the South West where blood had recently been shed.</p>
<p>In this place, Conrad might be happy at times. He saw simple folk going about their jobs, worrying only about the tasks in front of them, about getting by and about profits, not whether they would live or die or ever be free. They were, perhaps, freer than Conrad. On their faces he saw why he fought, why he would agree to kill. And in their words he felt welcomed, for people were not uniform here; was this tall man with dog's blue eyes to be regarded with any greater suspicion than sailors making a run from the Islands or from as far away as the scarcely charted North? People were accepting at times, and tolerant at worst.</p>
<p>But his idyllic time at the public house would one day be interrupted by ill tidings.</p>
<p>A hooded woman arrived by the river ferry. If one could not sail to port by Trade Waters for any conceivable reason, and one needed to make the journey by land, one made the most of the River Machtige and its ferries. The other choice was to ride slowly past the shacks and slums immediately west of Bayrock, with no reputable place to tether one's horse for the night, and who would do that when the ferries were not particularly expensive? It was quicker, sensible, and as a direct consequence, likely allowed money to go directly to central Bayrock from all points west up to the great Woods, circumventing the slums who could have used the business. Such was the misfortune of many, and the convenience of many a traveller.</p>
<p>The woman had no horse by the time she reached the river. For her, then, this choice became ten times safer. She had a message to deliver to Jonnecht, himself, and having proof of that, she no longer needed to pay the toll.</p>
<p>Once she arrived at the final stop, right where the river mouth widened and emptied into the bay, her journey became more difficult. One did not simply ask random passersby where one might find the General of the Kenderley Army, Western Division, nor did one request the audience of King Jonnecht and stand to wait for very long to deliver urgent news; for everyone in that line, their problem was an urgent problem, and she was not at liberty to explain to commoners what was afoot.</p>
<p>She found proper, uniformed members of the city guard, who roamed about ready to assist those in need; they were most likely to understand the sincerity of her need, the importance of her mission.</p>
<p>""A letter with the Kenderley seal, but it arrives here?"" Asked a guard.</p>
<p>She quickly hid the letter once again.</p>
<p>""The seal is but for us and for a greater authority to lay eyes upon. I was instructed to deliver this under very specific conditions, which I feel have been met. Who, in authority, is available to meet me?"" She explained, then asked.</p>
<p>The guards looked to each other, then one spoke to her again.</p>
<p>""The Great King has just recently returned to the capital, and I might not trouble him with this without knowing what it is. And you say you cannot tell me?""</p>
<p>She sighed. ""It need not necessarily be seen by the Great King himself, if one such as General Conrad is available; I am his agent. Bring me to him and he will confirm this.""</p>
<p>The guards could agree to those terms. If the General himself had no such knowledge of her, they could sieze the letter and see what the fuss was about; they saw no risk to themselves, provided they watch her closely. She did look and sound like a Kensrikan, which was of great value to their trust.</p>
<p>""Should I flag us a public riding box, then?"" One asked the other.</p>
<p>""For three people? No, look for something higher class."" He replied.</p>
<p>""And pay so much extra for such a short ride?"" The first balked.</p>
<p>""Nay, we commandeer it for the General's business. If this turns out to be a ruse, we know who exactly will pay."" He looked to the hooded woman.</p>
<p>She shrugged. ""Fair terms. But if the ride is as short as you say, we could walk.""</p>
<p>""Short to a horse, not to our feet."" Explained the first.</p>
<p>She nodded. She had been on her feet for quite some time, anyway.</p>
<p>After some loud yet barely intelligible argument, a higher quality riding carriage brought them to a public drinking house which could have passed for several others in central Bayrock, save that this one was the choice of General Conrad himself. This was something the soldiers knew among themselves, not that the place had taken it upon themselves to advertise their very important customer who appreciated some degree of low profile being kept for him.</p>
<p>Conrad looked up from his hoppy brew, thoughtfully stroking his newly growing beard as he heard people approaching at the entrance. There were not very many people in such an establishment at this relatively early hour; he had practically ordered the place open, not caring whether it was the proprietor or a deputy who poured him his steady liquid diet.</p>
<p>When he saw the hooded woman in the midst of the capital guards, he immediately put his drinking vessel down and very nearly tipped the table with his knees while he tried to stand.</p>
<p>""General Conrad."" She said.</p>
<p>""Sir. You know this woman?"" Asked one of the guards.</p>
<p>""Absolutely. Thank you for delivering her to me safely. Please be on your way and leave us here, to discuss whatever matter is at hand."" General Conrad ordered.</p>
<p>One guard turned to leave, and the other said, ""Private riding carriage, waiting outside for compensation. Apologies, sir.""</p>
<p>""Bah. Well, if she told me you had crowded her into a public box with the two of you, I suppose I would have tracked you down later and had words."" Conrad had a series of pouches, filled to different degrees with different coinage, and one of them was marked for expense compensation; he tossed a couple of gold coins at the guard who most recently spoke, who fumbled the coins three distinct times but impressively still caught them in the end.</p>
<p>Then both guards did as ordered. There was no one else in the room but the deputized bartender, who meticulously hand washed glasses and mugs with the slowness of an inexperienced person. Conrad felt little disruption of privacy, little threat of eavesdropping, from the young person who seemed intently focused on seeing their own reflection in glass that was merely destined to hold more hoppy brew.</p>
<p>""Frederique. I am already sorry to hear your news before you deliver it, but I can only be glad to see you again."" Conrad said before taking a big gulp of hoppy brew, after they sat down together.</p>
<p>""Need this letter be opened, then? It seems as if you already know, by heart, the circumstances that would bring me here."" She observed.</p>
<p>""I require specifics. And someone will have to deliver a message to a higher authority eventually. How ill are the tidings?"" He asked.</p>
<p>""You know the region. Not a weapon to be had among the people, as you would never have allowed such, so they all simply agree together that now is the time to be their own land. As for this letter, Lord den Holt, having been exiled from his own region, will be along within a few days to deliver one just like it."" She explained.</p>
<p>""He left at the same time, yet you deigned to deliver this letter, just to arrive a day or two faster?"" He asked, trying to determine the timeline of things.</p>
<p>Frederique shook her head. ""My source arrived to inform me before things happened, but not long before they were supposed to. I left knowing what they planned to do. About as peaceful a revolt as I ever heard of, but given Lord den Holt's decision to run everything with the local populace, even guards for his regional capital, and all of them in on it? I saw no way it could be thwarted, and very unlikely they would harm him.""</p>
<p>Conrad put his glass down after a thoughtful swig and gulp.</p>
<p>""How unlikely is 'very unlikely', in your estimation?""</p>
<p>She smiled. ""Very unlikely is exactly as it sounds. His daughter is said to have orchestrated some of it, from inside their home. Conrad, you have met them both. Do you see her agreeing to anything in which he would come to harm? I expect them to politely see him to the border, perhaps even give him a donkey and a cart to bear whatever belongings he can take with him.""</p>
<p>Conrad quietly evaluated the information, while Frederique looked at him expectantly. As top commanding officer of the Kenderley Army, Western Division, answering only to King Jonnecht himself, Conrad had found a willing agent in the reason, someone who had sources.</p>
<p>He had left her with this sealed letter to deliver to the king, sparing even the time it would take to write a new message, for there would only be one reason she might ever deliver one. Her one task, to keep informed of the goings-on in the region. Lord den Holt was adamant that the region not be armed to the teeth, nor stocked with guards constantly eyeing the local populace, in order to build trust and a strong belief in the benevolent nature of the Kenderleys as rulers; these people had many conquerors in their history and den Holt felt it was imperative that Kensrik be different, more humane. However, he could not event plant someone in commoner's attire directly among the populace when a Kensrikan would immediately stand out and likely be distrusted, or at the very least, not sufficiently trusted to hear important whispers.</p>
<p>Frederique lived near the great Woods and traded with some people local to the Valley of Garnecht. She had established connections and a cover story that was excellent because it was true; it was her daily life, with this one subtle modification, this one yellowed letter.</p>
<p>""Is there really no way whatsoever that you could have warned me sooner? Be honest. You know I trust you, Frederique."" He complained.</p>
<p>""I sincerely wish there was a way."" She conceded. ""You must realize that most of these people do not whisper, or care to be informed. They keep their heads down and take care of their families. If I was any less subtle about finding people in the inner circle of the revolt, it would become too obvious what I was doing, or what my contacts were doing. For most of them, this is just a thing which happens once in a lifetime, or something their parents passed down to them. Most have no personal connection with whomever is entering power, because nothing is expected to last. The good news is, most of them see no purpose in violence if it's simply to change the face of their rulers.""</p>
<p>He nodded and emptied the remaining contents of his drinking vessel down his gullet. Then he gestured to the deputy to pour him another one; the deputy sulked for having to make a pristine wiping job go to waste, and needed to realize the fleeting nature of a glass or mug's cleanliness in a public house.</p>
<p>""Are you all right, General? It seems to me we should deliver this message without delay. I do hear the king is recently returned from a journey by sea, but after all, there is no better time...""</p>
<p>""There is no good time for bad news when we consider the Great King. Have no illusions about being rewarded, as the bearer of such, no matter how diligent and quick you are; I would spare you. Nay, give me the letter, and I will reward you of my own purse, which anyway is that of the Army. Take the gold and return to your quiet life, and speak not of this business again."" Conrad ordered.</p>
<p>She placed the letter, still sealed, on the table, then placed her hand on his.</p>
<p>""You bear many burdens. I should hate to make you shoulder another. Are you certain?""</p>
<p>""As your commanding officer I make this decision. He knows not your face, pleasant as it is; he knows me well enough to seat me at his family table. I am well qualified for the task, and safer than any other could be."" Conrad removed one of his coin pouches outright and placed it in her hand, to make formal his command.</p>
<p>She whispered: ""Should he exile you from this wonderful place, sparing your life because you have been of use, you know where I am to be found. It is a quiet life, which perhaps you need.""</p>
<p>He smiled, and whispered back: ""Go now. Thank you for everything.""</p>
<p>The deputy brought a hoppy brew by hand, and Conrad grunted as he snatched the letter to prevent any beer from spilling on it, or any drinking vessel from being placed on it. Frederique took her gold and set out on the journey back home, which would be longer than the journey there without the benefit of the river current flowing one's way.</p>
<p>Conrad sat there with the letter in his pocket and nursed the hoppy brew. It would take some added courage to do what he decided to do next, but he considered the knowledge now in his possession, and he considered what King Jonnecht could know. Frederique was a privately and surreptitiously hired agent, a hire made independent of the Kenderleys themselves. What he had in his pocket should not exist to the knowledge of Jonnecht.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she was absolutely certain that Lord den Holt was on his way to Bayrock with a letter of his own, or a message in his mind sufficiently conveying the same knowledge. Perhaps there would be a letter crafted by the insurgents themselves, or perhaps Lord den Holt would refuse to be their messenger, insisting that he made this journey for himself. That man was likely doomed no matter who delivered ill tidings, so why not let him be the one to deliver them? Whether he lived or died, what Jonnecht would declare as punishment, would be the same, as far as Conrad knew.</p>
<p>When he was finished his hoppy brew, Conrad thanked the deputy with a gratuity higher than what was likely deserved, and left the public house. The General then found the nearest publicly accessible wood stove, and like many Kenderley foes and some Kenderleys themselves, Frederique's letter found its fate by fire. It was not recognizably anything by the time he left it.</p>
<p>He continued walking. He would eventually require a strategy, even if he would not formally be asked for one until a few days hence.</p>

<p>This story retells in far greater detail the tragedy of Duke Lenn, which was first revealed in <em>The Gift Knight's Quest</em>. It illustrates his life and times, but more importantly you get to learn about Zinna and see her more developed as a character. I'll figure out the other details as I go along.</p>

If you fail, you're dead.<br/>At least, that's what they want you to think.<br/>Miles away, a secret society has been growing, formed of those who have failed the Trials, or adult citizens who have run away from Revelstoke. An elite team called the Resistance has been elected to bring down the government, and put an end to the Trials. But when they return from a mission where three of their members have been kidnapped, and a series of murders shakes the community to its core, it seems like they've got a government spy somewhere in their midst. <br/>Will they be able to identify the saboteur, and bring them down?

<p><strong>Horoscope For the Week of October 25-31</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leo (20 March – 20 April): </strong>Be wary of enemies bearing gifts! Things will look bright for you at the beginning of the week, but don't let it lull you into a false sense of security. A task you once previously believed to be simple may turn out to be more trouble than it's worth. An unexpected turn could lead you to reconnecting with old friends. You can't change what happens to you, only how it affects your sunny outlook. Remember to smile for those who won't smile anymore!</p>
<p><strong>Scorpio (23 October – 22 November): </strong>Keep your wits about you, Scorpio! You've risen in prominence and it's your time to shine, but remember that a glimmer in the dark attracts all kinds. Your natural inclination for conflict might actually benefit you for once. What was once hidden will reveal itself to you towards the middle of the week, but the answer you find may only bring on more questions. May you find happiness in knowing, Scorpio. You would be the first person in history to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Capricorn (22 December – 20 January):</strong> You keep running away, but the ground won't meet your feet anymore. You have a mouthful of excuses, but no one wants to hear them. All your chickens are coming home to roost. They're catching up, looking for answers. Boy oh boy, do you have a lot to answer for. </p>
<p><strong>Virgo (23 August – 23 September):</strong> Be patient. You'll get what's coming to you.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the stairs was a dark, windowless concrete room, that smelled of damp basements and… something else. Something sharp, burnt almost. There was a click somewhere behind her and a bare bulb flickered to life. Fate winced at the sudden brightness and when her sight refocused, she saw that the room was not completely bare after all. In the middle of the room was a heavy wooden chair that had been bolted to the ground. Leather straps hung loose from its arms and its two front legs. Hanging over it, attached to its back, was what looked like a large metal bowl with a spiral of cords emerging from its top. <br/><br/>Isn’t that the fucking chair? Fate wasn't certain what part of her was doing the thinking now because she felt numb at the sight of what was indeed the electric chair.<br/><br/>“Holy shit,” she breathed. “How long has this been here?” Greene patted the chair’s arm and beamed with pride.<br/><br/>“This little sweetheart is practically new,” Greene said. “Installed it six months ago. And, let me tell you, it was a bitch to do under Lefevre’s nose.” <br/><br/>“I bet,” she said weakly. She started as the Corporal roughly grabbed her arm. “Hey—”<br/><br/>“Don’t!” Greene said as the other man reached for his keys. “Leave the cuffs on, just strap her in around the chest. She won’t get loose.” The Corporal licked his lips and glanced, frowning, at Fate. For a moment, Fate wondered if (hoped) he would argue, but he just nodded and turned her around roughly. Greene grabbed her and kicked her long legs out from under her, sending her falling backwards onto the chair. He held her down while the Corporal scrambled for the chest straps. Fate pushed against the hands on her shoulder, struggling while the other man tried to buckle her in.<br/><br/>“Don’t I at least get a last smoke?” she asked, still struggling, while they fumbled. The Corporal cursed.<br/><br/>“Hold her still, Sarge.”<br/><br/>There was another part of Fate, a part that was older than all the rest, the part she had been listening for her entire life, since she woke up on the cold winter shore and stumbled into the brush. It didn’t have a voice, but it thrummed through her like a second heart beat, loud enough and hard enough to rattle her bones. It was always there, always waiting.<br/><br/>And so, when above them, there was a loud sound, loud enough to cause the building to tremble and dust fall from the ceiling, it was only the two policemen who froze.<br/><br/>Fate kicked out, hitting the Corporal in the knee with a sharp crack, and kicked out again as he fell, catching him in his sternum, knocking the air from his chest. Greene began to move, his grip on her shoulders gone, as Fate surged upwards, angling her head back and catching his chin with her forehead. He staggered back, one hand at his jaw, the other reaching for the gun at his hip. Fate was out of the chair and rushing forward, leading with her shoulder, barreling into his chest and slamming him against the wall. She staggered back as he gasped for the breath she had knocked out of him, and prepared to attack again when her hair was pulled back in a tight grip and a knife was pushed against her throat. <br/><br/>“Stop,” the Corporal hissed. Fate twisted in his grasp, kicking behind her once, twice, three times in virtually the same spot where she’d kicked him earlier. He howled and half-stumbled back, his grip still in her hair. With a curse, he drew the knife across her throat, cutting deep.<br/><br/>Fate gasped, shuddering and wet, as her hair was released. She half-stumbled, half-fell to her knees, her throat gaping. The Corporal ignored her, went to tend to his fallen Sergeant, who was watching Fate with wide eyes set in a pale face.<br/><br/>“I’m fine, I’m fine,” he said, pushing at the younger man’s hands as they tried to help him to his feet. “For god’s sake, you need to—”<br/><br/>The funny thing about the others, about Cain and Eva and even Ingram, to a degree, is that they all try to hide their true, monstrous natures. Eva hides hers under compassion and her teetotalling restraint. Under social niceties and clean blouses and books. Cain hides his with his logic, his deductions, his tailored suits and the genteel company he occasionally kept (Eva and Cain were alike in a lot of ways). Under the good deeds he committed. The wolf, he’d explained once to Fate, relied on its instincts. It was only an animal. It could be controlled and broken the way a dog could, and that was what Cain did.<br/><br/>Ingram believed the monster inside of him was dead and all that remained was rot.<br/><br/>Fate never understood them, never bothered. Every time the beast inside of her began to climb out of its pit, Fate was always sure to reach out a helping hand.<br/><br/>A hissing gurgle was their only warning before the thing was on them. The Corporal screamed, was slammed back against the wall, flung to the floor. He spasmed and screamed again as teeth came for him, for his neck, too quickly for him to react. He screamed until his voice cut out suddenly and then the only noises he could make were wet, gurgling, gasping sounds. Eventually, he stopped making even those.<br/><br/>Greene flattened himself against the wall as the long, black haired thing chewed on the Corporal’s throat, pulling out long, wet, red strands from a blood-soaked neck. He watched the corporal spasm and twitch until he finally went still, but the thing didn't stop. The sight of it, with its hands still cuffed behind its back, brought Greene deliriously back to his childhood, of being taken to the fair on Halloween, on apples in a barrel filled with clear water. They told him to put his hands behind his back and only use his teeth.<br/><br/>Shaking and numb, he reached for his gun. The first two shots hit the thing on its side, just under its ribs. It looked up from the mess of raw meat and Greene let out a choked scream at the sight of its wide, burning eyes, fixing their stare on him. The slash in its throat was gone. The third shot went wide, cracking into the wall behind it. It howled and launched itself at Greene. The next shot hit its chest but it didn’t slow down.<br/><br/>The last thing Greene would take to his grave was the sight of blood-drenched teeth, coming for him.</p>

<p>When Alcatraz and Grandpa Smedry make a pilgrimage to the Free Kingdom city of Nalhalla, the Smedry home base, Alcatraz is shocked to see that he is, in fact, a legend. When he was a baby he was stolen by the Evil Librarians, and his mother, a Librarian herself, was behind the whole scheme. Now, with his estranged father, who is acting indeed strange; Bastille, who has been stripped of her armor; and Grandpa Smedry, who is, as always, late to everything (that’s his Talent), Alcatraz tries to save a city under siege. From who? Why, the Librarians of course!</p>

1743,Brandon Sanderson,Novel: Elantris,Genre: Fantasy,50000,"1,666",0,"
<p>It’s always interesting to describe your book to people, since a novel like this, at 200,000 words, is going to mean very different things to different people. If you want a more straightforward explanation of what the book’s about, read the Publisher’s Weekly review below. If you want something more casual, read the <a href=""http://www.brandonsanderson.com/elantris-prologue"">prologue</a>. If you want something between, read on!</p>
<p>Tor classifies this book as an epic fantasy. I’m not sure if that’s actually the case. There is no quest in this book, nor is it about the end of the world. It takes place (as many of my books do) in one city, and is a mixture of political intrigue, interesting magic, and character dynamics.</p>
<p>The setting is the city of Elantris and the surrounding suburbs. There’s a force in Arelon known as the Dor that randomly chooses people and grants them divine powers. Elantris was once the city of the gods, where anyone who was ‘chosen’ went to live. Ten years ago, the Elantrians lost their powers and caught a terrible disease instead. From that point on, Elantris became a prison city/contamination zone for any who caught that disease, for the Dor continues to choose people and curse them.</p>
<p>The book follows the experiences of three people as they interact with the people of Elantris. Raoden, a prince, catches the disease in chapter one and is thrown into the city by his own father. Sarene, Raoden’s sight-unseen fiancee from a political treaty, arrives in the city and gets involved in schemes, troubles, and politics involving Elantris. Hrathen, a priest and missionary, is sent to convert the people of Arelon, and is told that if he fails, the people of the country will need to be killed instead.</p>
<p>The three stories intertwine as the truth of what happened to Elantris, and its inhabitants, ten years ago is unearthed.</p>

<p>It began with the delivery truck.</p>
<p>Well, it did not <em>begin</em> with the delivery truck, so to speak. It began whenever the Wings of Refuge Care Center was founded. The Care Center was a huge, ugly brick building, walled in and windowless and stale-smelling. All of the children there had wings, feathered and colorful. White, brown, black, green, blue, red. The only source of color in that drab place.</p>
<p>One could get out of the Care Center if they really tried. If they swallowed their vitamin pills and oiled their feathers and flew in the wind tunnels until their muscles burned. If they bullied the others but were sweet to the nurses. The ones who excelled were taken away in pomp. The ones who failed – sickened or mutated – simply disappeared in the night, and no one was to speak of them.</p>
<p>But still there were whispers of a place called the Eyrie. Another way out. Raziel, who had twice attempted escape – Raziel, who claimed to remember life outside – believed in the Eyrie.</p>
<p>Enter the truck. Actually, it was out of the story almost as soon as it entered, but it played its part. That was how Raziel found herself leading three other winged children on the run.</p>
<p>There were four, later. But for now, let’s stick with the truck.</p>

<p>If they can pull this off, it’ll be the greatest con of their career . . . and the last.</p><p>When four henchmen-for-hire grow weary of carting crates around, freezing in leaky abandoned warehouses, trying to assemble tricky death rays, and of course being punched in the face by superheroes, they decide that it’s time for a career change. Unfortunately, easy as it is to get into the supervillain gig, it’s near-impossible to get out. Bruiser, Siphon, Poison Dart, and Zilch could face years of jail time. They will definitely face an unwanted conversation with the big bosses of the crime world, who don’t take kindly to traitors.</p><p>That is, unless they make a path of their own. Drawing on all their resources, they forge new identities for themselves and secretly apply to the Empyrean Games, the forum where all of America’s upcoming young superheroes gather to compete for fame and fortune. They don’t even have to win! If they make a good enough showing, they could draw in scholarships to any of the top schools for superhuman youths. From there, the worst things they’ll have to face are colored spandex and the adulation of millions.</p><p>But Siphon, a socially awkward android, can’t help but feel that she’s the group’s worst liability. Not to mention that they need a fifth member in order to qualify, the boys in the group can’t stop arguing over who’s a better leader, and they’re walking into a shark tank of costumed teenagers who will do anything to look good in front of the cameras. Is being a hero really worth it? And just what is a hero, anyway?</p>

She is happy and settled, and never thinks of searching for adventure. But when a light falls to earth one night, she impulsively follows it.

<p>King Davion sat on a low couch strewn with embroidered pillows. One of the servants, standing behind the couch, raised a long-handled feather fan and began to slowly waft it through the air. Queen Batesia sat beside her husband. Eyes red, she buried her fists in the folds of her long white skirt. The sons of the king knelt in a long line at the king’s left hand, the daughters facing them from the king’s right hand. Guards stood against the walls, their faces hidden by their helmets.<br/><br/>The head physician entered, bowing low before the king.<br/><br/>“How is the crown prince?” asked the king, in a hollow voice.<br/><br/>“Not well, majesty. We have given him the utmost care, and yet he continues in his delirium.” The physician fell to his knees. “Forgive me, my king. His sickness has no cure that I know of. I have failed you.”<br/><br/>The king’s face started to turn red, and he clenched a fist. His wife squeezed his arm quickly.<br/><br/>“You may retire to your quarters,” she said to the physician. He scurried out.<br/><br/>“Your majesty, may I speak?” asked Asta, from his spot halfway down the line. His half-brothers glanced at him out of the corners of their eyes.<br/><br/>“Fine,” said the king, massaging the bridge of his nose.<br/><br/>Asta stood up and stepped out of line. His eyes, like the queen’s, were red, and his hair was rumpled. “You know that Solivahn loved – loves, more than anything else, to wander. He often flew down to earth, to watch the landbound creatures. Humans, dogs, satyrs, creatures made of rock or water.”<br/><br/>The king’s eyes narrowed. The sons and daughters of the kings scowled or looked horrified – the loudest gasped in disapproval. The only people in the hall who did not react were the servants and guards (who had learned to school their faces), the queen (whom Asta had already informed), and Catena (who just stared ahead stolidly). <br/><br/>“It was just a hobby of his,” Asta said quickly. “He told me often of his excursions. It occurred to me that he could have fallen sick there. I visited yesterday and found nothing, but I am sure that upon further searching, we will find the cure to his malady.”<br/><br/>“So be it,” said the king, breathing deeply through his nose. “Send out guards. Asta, I place the royal army at your command.”<br/><br/>“Me? But sire – I’m no soldier. Novus or Hyorus would be better—”<br/><br/>“No,” said the king. “You know the places the crown prince visited, and so this task must fall to you. Succeed – for your prince’s sake.

The assistant principal really hoped that nobody was watching, either staff or student, as his reputation would suffer greatly if anyone knew what he was up to.<br/>            “Let’s make this quick,” said the assistant principal, “I have to get back to the game so I can supervise the students.”<br/>            Mario, the boy accompanying him, could hear the roar of the crowd as the game progressed.

Otherwise the crowd would not have reacted with cheers.<br/>            The pair made their way toward the back of the school and out a pair of imposing metal and glass doors.  The window in each door had a wire mesh embedded between panes of glass, supposedly making the door burglarproof.  Taking one look at the lock the school had chosen to secure the door, Mario knew he could defeat the simple 5-pin tumblers inside within a matter of seconds but he kept those thoughts to himself.<br/>            Exiting through that door, the duo made their way down a sidewalk and over to a fenced in area behind the school.  The fence stretched 7 feet high and surrounded a pad of concrete that measured 30 feet on each side.  A single gate permitted entry into the area, and currently that gate hung open.  Inside the enclosed area were several bikes that had been chained to a series of metal pipes inside.  The pipes themselves were embedded into the ground and secured with concrete. <br/>            “How long are these gates open for each day?” asked Mario.<br/>            “The custodians open them up around 7:30 in the morning, and they leave them open until 9:30 when classes start,” replied the man.  “We have a teacher who comes out here at the end of each school day and unlocks the gate just before the students are dismissed to go home.  The gates usually stay open until just after 6 in the evening when the after school group is released for the evening.”<br/>            Glancing at the various locks and chains that were chosen by his peers to secure their most prized possessions, Mario couldn’t help but think he could have his pick of any of these bikes in a matter of seconds if the mood struck him.<br/>            “What kind of lock did he use?” he asked.<br/>            The assistant principal opened the manila file folder he had been carrying, and flipped through several pages of witness statements before answering.<br/>            “It doesn’t say here,” the older man replied, “does that matter?”<br/>            “It would give me a better estimate for how long the thief or thieves were here,” said Mario.  “No lock means a quick in-and-out trip.  Even a cheap lock would have slowed them down a little.”  Them, but not me, he thought to himself.</p>

Believed that such thing should not be real, she set out an investigation to this nightmare substance, either to disprove its existence or reconsider the possibility that the real world was never what she thought it was.</p>

<p>The sound of flowing water surrounded me. If I did not aware that I was breathing, I would have mistaken that I was drowning. Another sound joining the water flow was a feminine wail, but not just any ordinary woman crying - it was somewhat of a wheeze accurately and steadily iterating every two seconds, yet the voice was tortured enough for me to tell it was a crying woman. </p>
<p>As I fixed my eyes over this new surrounding, I noticed everything was covered in a grey tone here, starting with a black ceiling filled with twisty water tubes leading to who-knows-where beyond the walls. Three white walls stood around me with two small inclines leading to their respective doors on both edges of the front wall. Between the doors was a tightly shut, dark brown wooden coffin sitting quietly here. The fourth wall stood behind me with a sewer passage in between, with more water tubes laying along the top edge. It felt moist here, but not cold nor smelly as one would expect from a sewer environment. The sewer passage was dark grey, with pitch black water running smoothly along it, forming a gentle, watery straight line in the middle. While it felt bright down here, there was no sign of any visible, clear light source, like a lamp or lightbulbs.</p>
<p>When I wave my hands around, it felt like I was gently paddling through shallow water. There was even that soothing watery sound as if I really moved some water with my hands. Additionally, when I wave my hands around and feel like moving through water, that steady and rhythmic noise of a crying woman becomes louder and clearer. When I stop however, she would turn quieter, but that tortured wheeze persisted as a background ambiance.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea where I am right now.</p>
<p>I turned to the sewage flow and peek along both sides. The sewer passage simply appeared as an endless straight line. The blackish water came from nowhere, went to nowhere. I had no intention to touch this questionable liquid, but I couldn't help to notice that when I wave my hands around to create sound of moving water, the blackish sewage water in front of me would stir gently. I even leaned in closer to confirm that reaction from the water. Though the blackish water flow was too thin to make out my own reflection.</p>
<p>Then the air stirred. It was too oddly calm and quiet here for me not to notice that. I turned back to the three walls and was greeted by a familiar face recently stepped out from the door to my right.</p>
<p>'Mike?'</p>
<p>'Rose? What are you doing here?' My friend was just as puzzled as I was apparently. Mike was the kind of friend I only meet every once in a rare while. I failed to find an appropriate way to describe this odd chance of seeing him in such a strange place, not only of our present circumstance, but also for the fact that we met without any purpose this time, which was what we used to do before we deem it necessary to see each other. Meeting each other with nothing necessary to say was never the condition we would see each other under.</p>
<p>I shrugged at him. The rhythmic wailing in the background echoed both the hollowness of the sewer and our cluelessness of our circumstance. I try my best to stay still so not to stir the watery air that would amplify the wailing ambience. He seemed to read fear on my face, even though I don't feel that scared, just disturbed.</p>
<p>'Let's try to figure out a way out of here.' Mike said as he wandered his blue gaze away from me. We both started moving around to inspect the area, amplifying the wailing ambience in the process. I peered at the back of his short dark hair to see if he got any reaction. 'Mikeâ€¦ Do you hear that too?'</p>
<p>He looked back at me in bewilderment. I explained the rhythmic wailing that has been looping since I found myself here and amplifies as I move. He fired back a question at me: 'So how did you get here?'</p>
<p>It was a haze. Heck, for all that I know, it all could have been a dream. I may very well be simply appearing over here in the blink of an eye. In fact that seemed like exactly how I got here, through the sound of gentle flowing water and later on, the rhythmic wailing when I found myself appeared.</p>
<p>Mike couldn't tell me in clear words how exactly he got here either. He just saw a door and figured he'd open it to see what was next. Then I remembered that he never answered my initial question. ' Oh,' he said, ' Yeah I can hear it, but it sounds like far away, and hasn't gotten louder.'</p>
<p>That was worrying enough to find out that I regret asking him about it. That almost meant I am part of the cause of this problem, even though I have no idea how that was possible. Before the worry escalates in my mind, and better yet, before Mike realised what I was worrying about, the other door was busted open, with this time a complete stranger entering our area. He was a classy looking British style gentleman with a lined suit and a hat. </p>
<p>'Good day my friends!' The stranger raised his hat at us in a really cheerful manner. We just stood perfectly still. ' How are we doing today? Oh what a nasty place. What has lured you to this filthy underground, hm?'</p>
<p>The stranger said all that with a big smile on his face, hat still in his hand. Mike and I looked at each other with frozen intentions, as if we both agree to simply wait for all this madness to go away on its own. The stranger did not seem to be offended by our awkward silence. 'Well if you are just feeling a little lost, I can help you to find your right track back! But a favor is a favor, you will need to help me first if you want me to help you!'</p>
<p>I was skeptical, sending mental messages to Mike through my eyes that I don't like the feeling of this. It might have been an illusion but the stranger's body seemed a little semi-transparent to me. Mike just shrugged at me and said 'Ah well, he is all we've got'.</p>
<p>' What do you need help with?'</p>
<p>The stranger bowed again with his hat carried to his chest. ' Lady and gentleman, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your offer to help me. I'm looking for something that was lost to me, and it is with much regret to say that we might have to search through all the rooms here before I decide to give up.'</p>
<p>And here came our questions, 'What exactly are you looking for, and how many rooms are we talking about?'</p>
<p>The stranger gave a wide and cheerful grin, ' Ah I'm afraid it's a tad bit too personal to reveal what it is so dear to me that I have clumpsily lost! All will be revealed when we found it, eh? As for how many rooms are out there, there are as many as the size of this place needs to be! The search shall be done when we are done, eh?'</p>
<p>That blabbering answered nothing at all. I looked at Mike again with a deep frown. He shrugged again. ' You could try walking down the sewer, see where that leads you.'</p>
<p>I sighed. ' Or may be we can find an exit on the way inside when we help this man.'</p>
<p>We looked back at the stranger, who still hold the hat in front of his chest and smilingly stare at our decision making. ' We will help you,' My voice was filled with distrust. </p>
<p>'Splendid! Come this way please!' The stranger put his hat back on, dancingly walked with joy towards the door he just came from. Then it dawned on me that I never knew what lies on the other side of these two doors. I asked Mike on our way out about his side of the door. 'There was nothing there,' he said, 'just four blank white walls in a square shape and the door that led me to you.'</p>

<p><strong> Wrap-Up #1: The Luddite Clause</strong></p>
<p>The sound of the shower running stopped, and Linda checked the eggs, then put the toast on. They both even liked their toast done the same way, or if they didn’t K.T. hadn’t said anything. Maybe K.T. could have the study permanently, if Linda put in a better bed. It would be nice to have a housemate. The thought kept popping up; there was probably some reason that it was so persistent. Probably the same reason that she kept thinking about K.T.’s eyes.</p>
<p><em>You’re acting like a girl with a crush. Stop it!</em></p>
<p>Her brain didn’t particularly want to stop it. Her brain wanted to linger on the possibilities of having a housemate... maybe more than a housemate. Maybe she wasn’t the only one having thoughts of staying close even after the trial. The speculative way that K.T. gave her when she served breakfast was interesting, even though it didn’t really give much away.</p>
<p>‘I saw you started editing.’</p>
<p>‘You don’t mind, do you?’ Maybe K.T. had left the manuscript there for another reason. ‘I can always erase it.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, no.’ K.T. gave her an enigmatic smile; the speculative look was still there. ‘I valued your input on the first draft. I think it will be even more important on this draft.’</p>
<p>‘I’ll do my best,’ Linda said, looking down into her coffee and feeling unaccountably shy all of a sudden.</p>

Or start taking pitchforks and flaming torches, which I think is probably more painful than umbrage.’</span></p>

<p>A few people gave them odd looks as they walked along the street, as if a troll carrying a boggan and pushing a stroller with a clearly upset child in it, accompanied by a talking cat riding a currently wolfy werewolf and a young woman who looked perfectly normal aside from the hat on her head that was haranguing her for running headlong into trouble, were somehow unusual.</p>

<p>The fridge had been stripped of anything perishable, but Liam found two frozen pizzas in the freezer and put them in the oven to cook. As the smell began to permeate the kitchen his stomach started rumbling, and he realised just how long it had been since he’d last eaten. Looking at the others he could see they were thinking along the same lines.</p>
<p>‘Has anyone still got their phone?’ he asked, very aware that he didn’t even have pants.</p>
<p>A trio of shaking heads was his response.</p>
<p>‘I have a hairpin,’ Sunny said, giving Lisa back her earring. ‘And some pocket fluff. And anything we can get from here. Dibs on the knife block.’</p>
<p>‘You can’t just knife people.’</p>
<p>‘Do you really want me bagsying the matches?’</p>
<p>Liam just hoped she would pick a small knife.</p>

<p>‘Yeah.’ Still staring at the floor. ‘I need you to help me tell them.’</p>

<p>‘Apple crumble’s in the oven,’ Beth informed us, sliding back into her seat. ‘Ice cream’s thawing. If anyone wants cream you have eighteen minutes to get to the shops before the timer goes ding.'<br/><br/>‘What flavour ice cream?’ I caught her hand again, admiring the polish on her nails. She was wearing red again; she claimed that red nails went faster for when she was writing.<br/><br/>‘Um, Neapolitan. It was all we had.'<br/><br/>‘Strawberry’s the best on apple crumble.’<br/><br/>‘If Beth’s left any in the tub,’ Mez said. ‘You know what she’s like.’<br/><br/>Beth huffed indignantly. ‘I am attempting to become an equal opportunity scooper, as you well know, thank you very much.’<br/><br/>‘What happened to “chocolate is for chocolate, not for random flavouring”?’<br/><br/>‘Went out the door when I tried chocolate pudding Jelly Bellies.’ Beth stretched and Pippin jumped up onto her lap.

<p>Big Bang Theory fan fiction, the sequel to one of my previous fics, 'the world is gonna bend'. In which Raj is a trans woman named Maya, Stuart from the Comic Center is her boyfriend, and there's not so much a plot as a series of events both unfortunate and fortunate. It's also going to be written in reverse big bang style (i.e. I have a fanmix that I'm going to try to centre the fic around) because I felt like making things even more complicated for myself. I find music really inspirational though so it shouldn't be too hard, especially because the mix I got (from Wrimo blueytheredler) is absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>'the world is gonna bend' can be found at my Archive of Our Own page (user name: notalwaysweak).</p>

<p>The next day she gets home from work and goes straight into the bathroom to put her new makeup on, taking time to get it right. She’s struck by the way the mascara makes her pupils look darker; Jess obviously has good taste in makeup. The eyeshadow is harder to apply and she has to fix more than one smear. She’s still ready to go in a green halter top and long brown skirt with strappy black sandals when Penny knocks on her door, though.<br/><br/>They catch a cab to the bar Penny’s picked out, collecting Priya on the way. Amy and Bernadette are waiting outside, Bernadette looking thrilled to be out and about with the girls, Amy looking half delighted and half nervous. That’s all right; Maya knows that alcohol can fix that sort of nerves, and Penny’s brought them to a bar known for its cocktails.<br/><br/>“Do you know <em>every</em> bar in Pasadena, Penny?” Bernadette asks as they walk in and one of the bartenders waves to Penny, and Penny just smiles and leads them to a miraculously vacant booth. Or maybe not so miraculously – it does happen to have a “Reserved” sign on it, although whether it’s reserved for them or not is another question.<br/><br/>“Hey, Garrett,” Penny says as the bartender himself brings over a trayful of drinks. They haven’t even looked at a menu yet, but apparently Penny has planned this evening thoroughly. “What have we here?”<br/><br/>“Sweets for the sweet, Pen. Are you ladies eating here tonight?”<br/><br/>“Oh, they <em>have</em> to try the potato chips with the onion crème fraiche.” Penny sips her drink. “I taste Chambord... and is this peach? Peach schnapps? And... melon?”<br/><br/>“Midori, and did you get the grapefruit juice?”<br/><br/>“So that’s what that was! I wasn’t sure if it was that or Cointreau.”<br/><br/>“Actually, that’s triple sec. It’s called a Sex on the Pool Table.”<br/><br/>Penny nearly snorts her drink out of her nose. “Garrett, you are pure class.”<br/><br/>“That’s why you love me. I’ll tell the kitchen to run you out those chips.” He leaves the girls to it. Maya takes a sip of her drink and decides it’s not too bad, even if the combination of liqueurs makes it a funny color. Priya looks at hers dubiously and pours a glass of water.<br/><br/>“Priya, don’t you dare pull the no alcohol thing,” Maya warns her.<br/><br/>“Some of us do have to work weekends.”<br/><br/>“Yes, but you also have to try this, because it’s <em>amazing</em>,” Penny says.<br/><br/>Amy and Bernadette sip at their drinks and both make approving noises, and that prompts Priya to loosen up and taste hers. “All right, you were right.”<br/><br/>The chips arrive. The taste of the onion crème fraiche is very sour by contrast to the cocktail, but Maya rather likes it and dunks another chip, trying not to drip anything on the table. She’s just getting really relaxed when Penny leans over and says, “So Maya, when were you going to tell us that Stuart’s moved in with you?”<br/><br/>Maya sputters a little, but there’s nothing to be done now; all eyes are on her. “I was going to say something eventually. I was just waiting for the right time. I didn’t want you to think I was rushing things.”<br/><br/>“Considering the glacial pace of my relationship with Sheldon, I hardly think I’m in any position to pass comment on the speed of anyone else’s relationship,” Amy says, swirling her straw around in her drink.<br/><br/>“I don’t think you’re rushing things,” Penny says.<br/><br/>“I think it’s really sweet,” Bernadette chimes in.<br/><br/>Maya looks at Priya. “How about you, Pri? Care to weigh in?”<br/><br/>“I think I’m just glad I moved out when I did to give you the opportunity to take the step forward,” Priya says. “Okay, maybe it’s a little fast, but under the circumstances, it’s better than Stuart’s prior living arrangements.”<br/><br/>“His what now?” Penny has almost finished her drink already.<br/><br/>“He was living in the store,” Maya says. “He had an air mattress in the storage room. I didn’t want him to have to sleep there when I have a perfectly good bed.”<br/><br/>“I’ll drink to that.” Penny raises her glass. “To good beds! And Maya and Stuart!” The others clink their glasses against hers and each take a mouthful of the sweet cocktail.</p>

<p>By the time I got down to Jamie’s workplace, most of the cops, staff, and assorted gawkers and lookie-loos were gone. Jamie was still there, sitting on one of the smoking benches out the front with a beefy female cop who was idly drumming a pen against her clipboard, and a male cop who didn’t look old enough to be wearing the stripes of rank that he had on his shoulder – or the stick he apparently had jammed up his arse.<br/><br/>I made a beeline towards Jamie, but the male cop intercepted me.<br/><br/>‘Elizabeth Green?’ he asked.<br/><br/>I gave him a blank look and was about to correct him, when Jamie and the female cop chorused, ‘It’s <em>Bethany</em>.’<br/><br/>The male cop’s eye roll was almost audible. ‘Bethany Green, right, okay. I just wanted to ask you if you knew anything about this.’<br/><br/>‘Why would I know anything about this?’ I amped up the blank look as much as I could. It was hard to look any blanker. I’d need to lose a few parts of my face to be able to manage it. ‘I only just got here.’<br/><br/>‘Of course you did.’ His expression and tone said that he thought I was a complete idiot. ‘I’m wondering if you were here yesterday, for example.’<br/><br/>‘I was at work on Southbank yesterday and then I went straight home. I had an overnight shift, so I was pretty tired. I didn’t leave home again until I came down here this morning.’<br/><br/>Whether it was because it was so simple or because I looked sincere, I don’t know, but apparently he believed me. It was either that or he was ready to pack it in for the morning and go and have elevenses somewhere. I’m not saying he was overweight or anything like that, but he seemed antsy. I knew if I wanted to write up a report on a homicide case I’d want a nice hot cup of coffee to sustain me through it. Especially if I thought I had the main suspect locked away somewhere. Honestly, that’s what I was expecting to happen next; he might have believed me, but I was pretty sure he didn’t believe Jamie, and that he’d be opening the back door of the police car and ushering Jamie in any second now.<br/><br/>Instead, he stepped back from me – and it was only then that I realised just how far into my personal space he’d gotten – and nodded to the female cop, who touched Jamie’s arm and stood up.<br/><br/>‘We’d suggest that neither of you leave town any time soon,’ he said, folding his arms. ‘You should also keep yourselves contactable at all times. I’d make sure that your mobile phones are charged and on your person. I’m sure you can both appreciate that this is a very serious situation we’re talking about here.’<br/><br/>I didn’t know how to respond to that other than the absurd desire to tell him we were Amish and he’d have to get messages to us via carrier pigeon.<br/><br/>He didn’t bother to acknowledge us with any further comment, not so much as a goodbye, just got into the car and started it up. The female cop gave both Jamie and me a quick smile and then got into the passenger seat. They roared off up the street at a speed I was quite sure was over the limit – I was surprised that he didn’t have the sirens and lights going as well.<br/><br/>I sat down beside Jamie and he kind of collapsed against me. He wasn’t crying, but he was shaking a hell of a lot, and all I could do was hold him tight and run my fingers through his hair and rock him. I briefly entertained the idea of singing ‘Soft Kitty’ to him, but being implicitly, if not overtly, accused of murder wasn’t a kind of being sick.<br/><br/>Finally he sat up straight and gave me a wan smile. ‘Let’s get out of here,’ he said.<br/><br/>‘Most used line in movies,’ I said automatically.<br/><br/>‘What?’<br/><br/>‘Nothing, just something from a book I read once. Do you want to go home?’<br/><br/>He shook his head vehemently. ‘I want to go somewhere that I know nobody’s died. Or that I’m reasonably certain nobody’s died. I don’t want to think about Sam, or Alex, or bloody Douglas.’<br/><br/>Fair enough; I’d spent months not wanting to think about bloody Douglas. I took his hand and pulled him to his feet. ‘Come on then. I know where we’re going.’<br/><br/>He let me lead the way. It was a little disconcerting to see him feeling so low. He only asked where we were going once and I told him it was a surprise.</p>

<p>The other two only barely looked up as Rae made a mad dash for the bathroom, probably assuming that she’d cut herself or something. She had a tendency towards clumsiness, especially at moments of high stress, and realising that she was suddenly shrinking was certainly a cause for high stress. The bathroom had a second doorway into her own room and she detoured through it after seeing her face in the mirror, realising that the doorknob was now at chin height. Not good, not good, not good. She made sure the bedroom door was shut as well before dropping onto the bed and pulling out her mobile, scrolling swiftly down to Alexander’s number and hitting ‘send’, crossing her fingers that he’d pick up.<br/><br/>‘Bratspies residence, His Highness’s secretary of state speaking.’<br/><br/>Rae closed her eyes in relief. ‘Sarah. It’s Rae.’<br/><br/>‘Oh, hey, how are you?’<br/><br/>‘Freaking out.’ Rae took a deep breath. ‘My glamour slipped and I can’t fix it, no matter what I try, and the others are going to notice in about five minutes.’<br/><br/>‘Oh. Oh, hiss.’ Sarah had once been a cat. Old habits die hard. ‘Are you alone right now?’<br/><br/>‘Yeah, Linz and Hannah are in the living room discussing what blue tastes like.’<br/><br/>‘Oh, easy, that Blue Heaven milkshake flavour.’<br/><br/>‘Sarah.’<br/><br/>‘Sorry. Any idea why it slipped?’<br/><br/>‘No.’ Rae opened her eyes again and grabbed her largest stuffed wombat, Big Wom, off her bed, and cuddled him against her chest. ‘It’s just – I don’t know.’<br/><br/>‘Mrowl. Alexander, Rae’s in trouble.’<br/><br/>There was a rattle and a clunk and Alexander picked up the extension. ‘What sort of trouble?’<br/><br/>‘I can’t get my glamour to stick.’<br/><br/>Alexander’s swearing was much more colourful and less feline-esque than Sarah’s. ‘Do Linden and Hannah know?’<br/><br/>‘No.’ Rae held the toy closer, feeling his stiff synthetic fur and plastic nose and eyes and reaching futilely for the her that she’d been in public for so long, the her that could reach things without a stepladder and wasn’t shorter than her own daughter. ‘Alexander, what do I do?’<br/><br/>He was quiet for too long, and Rae actually pulled her phone away from her ear to check that the reception hadn’t died; seeing the four green bars, she put it back. Finally he responded. ‘We have a situation here as well.’<br/><br/>‘What sort of situation?’<br/><br/>‘Meow,’ Sarah said, and this time it wasn’t the sardonic spoken meow that she occasionally liked to use, but an actual cat sound, and Rae shut her eyes again because it was easier to pretend that the world hadn’t just turned upside down when she couldn’t see it.<br/><br/>Just to complicate matters, then there was a knock at her bedroom door. ‘Rae-Rae? Everything okay? The ice cream’s threatening to go oozy.’<br/><br/>‘Oozy’s the best,’ Rae called back, proud of how non-shaky her voice was. ‘I’ll be out in a couple, I’m on the phone.’<br/><br/>‘Okay.’ Linden’s footsteps retreated, and Rae breathed a sigh of relief. She’d bought herself a couple more minutes before she’d have to go out there and face the music, or rather the screaming. Thing was, going from five foot two to two foot three was kind of something that the other two would notice, that she couldn’t quite disguise by standing on a box or something. But it seemed as though she was on her own, at least for now, judging from the thumping and hissing sounds coming from the other end of the phone.<br/><br/>‘Alexander? Take care of your situation, okay? I’ll manage here.’ She wasn’t a hundred percent sure that she would manage, but it was better than adding her freaking out to his list of things to worry about. ‘Tell Sarah to take it easy. This has to be reversible.’<br/><br/>His voice was muffled as he answered, ‘Yeah, as soon as I get her out from under the bed. It’s been a while and she’s not exactly on top of this whole cat instincts thing.’<br/><br/>‘Um, sure. Take care. Bye.’ Rae hung up and then immediately went back to the contacts menu. Now that she was done talking to Alexander, it was time to call Alexander and see if he’d heard anything. <br/><br/>If only real life worked like books and nobody had the same first name as anyone else unless it was for some Deep Plot Purpose. Or if one of the two of them would answer to Alex or Xander or Lex or something like that.<br/><br/>Alexander answered on the second ring, and his voice was deep and reassuring. ‘I’m guessing you have a situation too, Rae,’ he said without preamble.<br/><br/>‘I’m seeing eye to eye with my daughter.’<br/><br/>‘And I’m trying to extract myself from the driver’s seat of my car. The roof is never going to be the same.’<br/><br/>‘Oh Alexander! You’re not hurt, are you?’<br/><br/>‘Do you think insurance usually covers acts of rogue magic?’ They shared a short, slightly panicked laugh, and then Alexander got serious again. ‘Are you going to be seen?’<br/><br/>‘Linden’s home,’ Rae said, ‘and she doesn’t know. And Hannah, although she might think it’s some sort of game.’ She doubted it very much, though. Maybe three or four years ago, but Hannah was smart enough now to know there wasn’t a trick to make her mother look so small. Well, there was, but not in a way Hannah was meant to know about. Not a smoke and mirrors trick. A real magic trick.<br/><br/>Alexander exhaled slowly. ‘Not good. Where are you?’<br/><br/>‘Bedroom.’<br/><br/>‘Can you lock the door?’<br/><br/>‘No. The bathroom door’s locked but the bedroom door won’t, and anyway Linz would just beat it down.’<br/><br/>‘Hmmm. High heels?’<br/><br/>‘I don’t have any that add three feet to my height.’ There was a squeal of bending metal and a crash from Alexander’s end of the line. ‘What’s that?’<br/><br/>‘Formerly my car door.’<br/><br/>‘Ouch.’<br/><br/>‘It’ll be all right,’ said Alexander, the eternal optimist. ‘Let’s see… can you go out of a window?’<br/><br/>‘You do remember that I’m on the fourth floor here?’<br/><br/>‘Oops. Slight error of calculation there. Unless you have some bedsheets that you don’t mind tearing up?’<br/><br/>‘Yeah, because that’s not going to look at all dodgy to the neighbours.’ Besides, Rae liked her bedsheets. It was hard to find camouflage print sprinkled with pink hibiscuses.<br/><br/>Linden banged on the bathroom door. ‘Rae! Did you fall in or what?’<br/><br/>‘Uh oh.’<br/><br/>‘Yes,’ Alexander agreed. ‘What are you going to do?’<br/><br/>‘I guess I’m going to go talk to her,’ Rae said dispiritedly. ‘Who knows how long this is going to last?’<br/><br/>‘Oh, just long enough to ruin all our lives,’ Alexander said. ‘Isn’t that how these things usually work?’<br/><br/>‘I’ll be in touch if I hear anything more. Don’t hit your head on anything.’ Rae hung up and shoved the phone into her pocket. Great. Now she was going to have to figure out how to explain to Linden that she wasn’t actually human, not to mention explaining it to Hannah, who was still young enough to have trouble figuring out the difference between reality and fantasy at times as it was.<br/><br/>‘Maybe I can pass it off as a really realistic Halloween costume,’ she muttered to herself.</p>

I reached out and grabbed her around the waist, pinning her hands to her sides. ‘But at least I won’t have to listen to you going on and on and on about it any more.’ I shoved her headfirst into the milk jug, jammed it under the steam wand, and gave it maximum power. She screamed. Once. Then the milk turned pink and one tiny wing floated forlornly to the top of it.<br/><br/>I carefully poured the milk into the cup. It was a bit lumpy, so I strained it with a spare wide mesh filter. The lumps went into the rubbish with the remains of the muffin.

<p>The trio were almost clear of the big tent when a tall man wearing a spangled suit and a top hat dashed through the main entrance and grabbed Toby’s arm. ‘Come on, you’re meant to be performing now, not skulking around out here!’ he snapped. Toby tried to pull away, but the man tightened his grip, and Toby gasped.</p><p>‘Let him go!’ Erica said.</p><p>‘Don’t you start with me, young lady. The audience have been waiting for five minutes already. If you don’t get out there and perform, I’ll drag you in there by the hair. Hell, I might do that anyway. Your act’s getting dull. Nobody believes you’re really putting yourself at risk, and so they think it’s all rubbish.’ He let go of Toby’s arm and shoved him towards the tent entrance; Toby stumbled, swore, regained his footing, and turned to run.</p><p>‘I don’t think so, son,’ a second man drawled from behind the first. This man held a leash. The leash was connected to a harness, and the harness was around what looked like approximately four hundred pounds of tiger. The tiger had probably been a white tiger once, but some sort of dye had turned parts of its white fur red, so that it appeared to be streaked with blood. It sat a pace behind its trainer like a tame dog and a growl rumbled deep in its chest. ‘What say y’all get in there and do your thing now, huh?’</p><p>Toby limped forward and Erica and Missy had to follow, since the tiger looked like it hadn’t eaten in about a week, judging by the hungry way that it stared at them. The big tent smelled of sawdust and popcorn and tomato sauce and animal shit and the avid sweaty smell of hundreds of people. They walked down a short space between two sets of wooden bleachers, seeing feet and ankles and then whole people. A couple of the spectators peered curiously over the railings at them. One of them spat into the sawdust at their feet and Missy made a sound of disgust; the man turned to face forward again, grinning an almost-toothless grin.</p>

<p>The computer projected a map of the Earth onto the blank white (or mostly white) wall behind Sorrel’s navigation console. The oceans appeared in blue and the landmasses in green, except for the polar ice caps, which were white. The computer had tried to simulate the same colours as Captain Krill would see from space, because it knew that mere directions would not necessarily be enough to explain to the Captain where he was going.</p><p>Captain Krill studied the map for a long while as he waited for Rodney. Sorrel came in, yawning, and settled into her chair.</p><p>‘Have you decided where we’re aiming for yet?’ she asked – she, as the navigation officer, had already studied the maps of the Earth many times, as well as carefully considering other things, such as the political climate and the actual climate. There was no sense in shooting for somewhere that was going to be freezing cold.</p><p>Captain Krill pointed with one finger, which was tipped with a small curved claw. ‘I thought we’d land somewhere up here. It looks big, but we can take it in no time.’</p><p>Sorrel rolled her eyes, although she made sure he wasn’t looking – she wasn’t that stupid. ‘Captain, that’s the United States of America. It’s a good target, but I don’t think it should be our first target. We need to start small and work our way up.’</p><p>‘Do you really think so? Where’s Rodney? He’s meant to be the one in charge of all this tactical bullshit.’</p><p>‘I’ve got no idea,’ Sorrel said, lying through her teeth. She knew perfectly well that Rodney was in the sauna (although quite how one was meant to distinguish the sauna from the other rooms on board the ship was unclear).</p><p>Captain Krill’s finger moved a bit. ‘What about here, then?’</p><p>‘That’s Hawaii. That’s one of the United States of America as well. And it’s a bit <em>too</em> small.’</p><p>‘Well, you tell me where you think we should land then,’ Captain Krill snapped. ‘Not that I’m the Captain and should be making all the decisions, or anything.’</p><p>Sorrel pointed much lower, to a landmass that looked like a round biscuit with two bites taken out of it, one at the top and one at the bottom. ‘I’d suggest here, sir. It’s not the most influential place on Earth, but it’s small, and a lot of it’s unpopulated. There’s a big desert in the middle. Plus, it’s supposed to be getting into the hot season there, rather than being wet and cold like a lot of the big places up the top.’ Sorrel, like the computer, also talked down to Captain Krill, although she got away with it because she was prettier.</p>

<p>In the city of Vespra, there is nothing to hold humanity back from making the kind of technological progress we had once only dreamed of. With conventional ethics taking a back seat to the need for medical advancements, the metropolis has become a playground for ambitious scientists, doctors and entrepreneurs. Shutting itself off from the rest of the world, scientists here are able to focus on their innovations without the moral scrutiny that would have once forced them to do things differently. The result is a world ruled by pharma companies, where your worth is basically measured by how much you can contribute to science. Society is virtually divided into two groups: those who experiment, and those who are experimented on. <br/><br/>Allegra is an orphan -a classic victim of Vespra's cruel social divide. With nothing going for her, she spends her days trying to keep afloat as a dealer of black market hallucinogens. Like many others, she pines for an escape to the Blues -the illustrious business district filled with the promises of prosperity and opportunity, but she knows her dream is hopeless.<br/><br/>One day, a chance encounter with Alastair -the heir to a rising biotech company, creates an opportunity for Allegra that she latches on to. With nothing to lose, she pours herself into the fantasy that he presents her with, not stopping for one second to consider the consequences of her actions. In her relentless pursuit of a new life Allegra forgets something very important: that lies are all around us, and a lot of what has been done can never be undone.</p>

<p>What happened in book 1:</p>
<p>""Griffins' Promise"" is the sequel to ""Griffins' Medaillon"" in which teenage girl Charly accidentally entered Area, the world of griffins, and was transformed into a griffin herself. Although she was a felide, a cat-griffin, and not even a real one, she fell in love with repellent canide - wolf-griffin - Lero. It took her a while to get him unbend, but finally they made a couple welded together like Area had never seen before. And although she managed to survive and made it back to her own world, Charly finally decided to return to Area and stay with Lero.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What happens in book 2:</p>
<p>Sonja, Charly's best friend and a teenager like she has once been, can't leave the past behind. Although the police stopped asking her about the events few months ago, she can't forget Charly who decided to become a griffin in Area forever. When Sonja walks to where her friend jumped to the portal between both worlds, she finds the medaillon Zyrion that now is broken and turned its colour to black. She's shocked about finding it, but tries to hide it. When her mother nearly finds out about the medaillon, Sonja panics - and suddenly she's in Area, the broken medaillon in her hand. But she hasn't been turned into a griffin like Charly.</p>
<p>Good luck it's Derion, Lero's old mentor, who finds her first. With his help, she gets to Charly, who is shocked to find her in this world. But also Sonja is troubled to recognise her old friend in her griffin's shape.</p>
<p>Danger's not over. Not only does Charly have to find a way to bring Sonja back home with the broken medaillon's help - also Zyrion absorbed bad and dark energy since it was damaged. This energy lets the dark avide griffin who stole the medaillon thousands of years ago return as a shadow-shaped, caught in his burning whish for revenge. Together, Charly, Lero and Sonja have to find a way to destroy the dark shadow and bring Sonja back home, as well as care for lonely wolf-griffin puppy Kibubi whom they find on their way. And Sonja and Charly have to find out whether their friendship can last between two races as well as two worlds ...</p>

<p><u><strong>Deutsch:</strong></u><br/>""Die Silbernen"", wie ich mein diesjähriges Projekt auch nenne, sind mein dritter NaNo-Roman. Nach Urban Fantasy 2012 und Portal Fantasy 2013 ist dieses Jahr High Fantasy dran. Keala ist eine Seboryn - ein menschenähnliches Wesen mit großen Schwingen. Sie lebt in Norta, dem Nordreich der Seboryn-Welt, und ist eine Rebellin, wie sie im Buche steht: Sie liebt es, alle Regeln zu brechen und das zu tun, was ihr Freude bereitet. Eines tages jedoch geht sie deutlich zu weit - und wird von der Silbergarde gestellt, den Elitesoldaten der Seboryn-Herrscher. Sie berauben sie ihrer Flügel und bringen sie in ein Arbeitslager.</p>
<p>Keala ist verzweifelt, doch für sie kommt es noch schlimmer, als sie entdeckt, dass das Herrscher-Trio in Wahrheit verlogen ist und die silbernen Schwingen, die Herrscher erhalten, reiner Betrug sind ...</p>

But one day, she goes too far - and is captured by the Silver Guard, the soldiers of the Seboryn's lords. They steal her wings and bring her to some sort of prison.</p>
<p>Keala is desperate, but things come even worse whe she discovers that the two lords and the lady of the Seboryn are nothing but impostors ...</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>         </strong>A concierge at a luxury apartment building will admit – assuming he (or she) is being honest, and definitely off the record – to having favorites among the residents.  It’s only natural for this to happen.  When you work in a building with 100 or so apartments, populated by a similar number of families, you’re going to have to deal with a wide range of personalities and temperaments.  Years of experience in the job proved to me the “20 Percent Rule.”  It states that 20 percent of the residents will take up 80 percent of your time.</p>
<p>         Roberta Beale was a real standout, though, even among the 20 percenters.  Don’t get me wrong; I liked Roberta very much, and fortunately, she seemed to like me as well.  It helped that Bleu, her small dog of indeterminate breed, liked me.  Roberta set great stock by Bleu’s appraisal of people, and I’ll admit to doting on the little guy.</p>
<p>         Roberta was also crazy.  For that matter, Bleu probably wasn’t completely sane, either.</p>
<p>         This story is my story, of course, but it’s Roberta’s fault that it happened at all.  In her inimitable way, she managed to keep us all jumping right up to, and even after, her unfortunate demise from heart problems.  Rather like a short, frumpy, female version of Frank Sinatra, Roberta Beale did everything her way, and woe unto anybody who thought to get in her way.</p>

<p>My family isn't crazy. Well, not<em> really</em> crazy. Not padded walls and straightjacket crazy, anyway. Really. Now, I'll own up to our being steadfastly <em>Southern</em>, which does necessarily entail a few peculiarities of character. But that just means we're colorful. Besides, I'm far too well-adjusted myself to have been raised by crazy people. Perish the thought!</p><p>OK, so there have been a few <em>accidents </em>here and there. Everybody has to die sometime. right? It's not our fault that some of our kin happened to depart this earthly value in unusual ways. Really, I blame the media for sensationalizing it -- and they do, <em>every single time it happens.</em></p><p>Perhaps I'd better explain ....</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>            “ALL CHARACTERS APPEARING IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS.  ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL PERSONS, LIVING OR DEAD, IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.”</p><p>            There.  Sorry, that ALL CAPS notice had to be put there.  My attorney insisted.  When lawyers begin throwing around words like malicious intent, slander, and libel, it’s a sure sign they’re getting het up over something.  I like my attorney; he’s a good man.  You know you have a good lawyer when they try to warn you off of getting in trouble, rather than waiting for the hourly fees to roll in while they try to get you out of trouble.</p><p>            I delight in telling stories about my family – my fictional family, of course.  I’m Southern, but live in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, so people here have this sort of unspoken expectation that I should be colorful.  In truth, a lot of them think I should speak with a drawl, scratch myself in indelicate ways, and have an odd number of teeth unevenly placed in my mouth.  Those are the yankees I tell to go … well, what I suggest they do is anatomically impossible, but it does convey my feelings for their ignorance.</p><p>            Which reminds me, I should write a dedication page.  Most people in this state – and all of my friends here – are lovely and delightful people.  I found the love of my life here.  I’ve made friends who I cherish here.  And honestly, in the quest to live up to the whole “colorful man from the South” expectation, I’ve decided to write down these stories of these fictional Southerners. </p><p>            Just remember, this is fiction.  All fiction.  Every last word.  A complete and utter fabrication, manufactured from whole cloth.  Written by a colorful Southerner who lives in Boston and has a very, very good attorney on retainer in case you decide otherwise and want to make a federal case out of it. </p><p>            As the disclaimer states, any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.  And you can’t prove otherwise.  So there.</p>

<p>A door at the back of the room opened.  That was my first sight of <em>her</em>.  She sailed in, holding a Virginia Slims cigarette in long, elegant fingers, wearing a blue satin dress by Halston with spaghetti straps.  She was trailed by a man in black tie, holding a martini glass.<br/><br/>“I don’t see why you won’t go away with me,” he said, his plaintive tone bordering on pleading.  “It’s only a week.”<br/><br/>“Lindsay,” she said, “my new show debuts next month.  It’s barely even written.  I can’t just traipse off to England on your whim!  I assure you, Lindsay darling, that Lady Di can marry that jug-eared prince without our presence in the realm.  Why, Vera wouldn’t know what to do without me.”  A quick tap of her cigarette knocked the ash off the end.  <br/><br/>“But Dame, I have a suite at the …”<br/><br/>That was when she noticed us standing there.  An elegant hand flew up, quieting the man.  She swept over to us, hand extended from the shoulder, and kissed Norah, first on one cheek, then the other.  “Hello!  It’s so good to see you again, my dear!”  She smiled down at me warmly, and I blushed.  “Forgive me, darling, but I’ve just completely forgotten your name.  Did I invite you, or did somebody else bring you along?”  She reached out and ruffled my hair affectionately.  “And your son is so very handsome!  Most parents would be afraid to bring their children to one of my parties!  Brava, my dear!  What is your name again?”<br/><br/>Norah cleared her throat nervously.  “I, um,” she began.  “Are you the lady of the house?”<br/><br/>“Why yes,” she said, smiling brightly, motioning with the Virginia Slim held lightly between two forked fingers.  “I am indeed the chatelaine of this august establishment.”<br/><br/>“Ah!  I didn’t know Mr. Delacorte was married!  How lovely!”  Norah practically gushed.<br/><br/>The man – Lindsay – unsuccessfully stifled a laugh, trying to cover it with a fake cough.<br/><br/>The previous warmth in her expression replaced by caution, our hostess again asked who we were.<br/><br/>“I’m Norah Muldoon, and this is young Patrick Delacorte.”<br/><br/>She looked at Norah in shock.  “But that’s impossible,” she said.  “You’re arriving tomorrow.”<br/><br/>“I sent a letter,” Norah said.  “I told you we would be here on July 1st.”  <br/><br/>“But it’s June 31st,” she replied.<br/><br/>“It’s July 1st, Dame,” Lindsay said.  “June has 30 days.”<br/><br/>“Oh my God,” she said, dropping to her knees to look me in the eye.  “You’re Patrick?”<br/><br/>I swallowed before replying.  “Yes ma’am,” I said, remembering the etiquette lessons Norah had drilled into me.  I held out my hand.  “How do you do?”<br/><br/>“Oh, this is awful!”  She balled her elegant hands into fists.  “I never would have thrown this party if I’d realized today was today.”  She looked over her shoulder.  “Lindsay, give us a moment.”<br/><br/>“I’m going, I’m going,” he replied quickly.  He offered his arm to Norah.  “Ms. Muldoon, is it?  May I get you a drink?”<br/><br/>Norah looked over at me, then back.  “I don’t often indulge,” she began, “but maybe just this once.”<br/><br/>I watched them leave, then I remember looking into our hostess’s hazel eyes as she regarded me intently.  She sighed.  “You’re in for a helluva surprise, kid,” she said quietly.  She leaned in, took both my hands into hers, and gently revealed the surprising truth.<br/><br/>“Kid,” she said softly, almost whispering, “I don’t know how to say this, but … well, I’m your Uncle Damien.”<br/><br/>There was something about those words, stated so plainly, and the warmth in the voice, and the look of unbridled affection plainly clear in those hazel eyes.  I looked back at her – him – whatever – and broke out into an enormous grin.  At that moment, I knew, with a certainty far beyond my years, that I was safe, and that everything was going to be all right.</p>

<p><strong>At the Waffle House</strong><br/><br/>	One of the regulars, Glenn, always sat in the booth beneath the one-way mirror at the back of the restaurant.  That mirror let the manager watch the goings-on without being seen in his office.  Glenn’s curly gray hair framed a surprisingly youthful, ruddy face.  Chris liked Glenn, who seemed to spend most of his time in “his booth” when he wasn’t working.<br/><br/>	Glenn’s friend Al was a pudgy black man who was almost always “between jobs,” as he described it.  He hung out at the Waffle House—sometimes with Glenn, sometimes alone at the counter—sipping from his bottomless cup of coffee and telling stories.<br/><br/>	“Good afternoon!”  Chris greeted the duo as they came in and headed to Glenn’s booth and settled in.  Without being asked, Chris poured two cups of coffee and placed a fresh pitcher of cream on the table.  “Hey guys,” he said.  “How’s everything today?”<br/><br/>	“Hey rookie,” All said expansively.  “It’s all good.”<br/><br/>	“Fine,” was Glenn’s more taciturn response, as he concentrated on pouring precisely the right amount of cream into his coffee.  <br/><br/>	“Y’all call me when you’re ready for a refill,” Chris said with a smile.  <br/><br/>	“What if we want some supper?” Al asked.<br/><br/>	Chris stopped.  <br/><br/>	“If y’all wanted supper,” Barb called from the other side of the restaurant, “young Chris here would be in for the biggest surprise of his young life.”<br/><br/>	“Y’all call me if you want anything,” Chris said, covering all the bases.  <br/><br/>	Barb slipped by, announcing she was going out for a smoke.  As nobody was in the restaurant, it shouldn’t present a problem.  <br/><br/>	Chris leaned against the bar, chatting with his two favorite customers, while Barb smoked.  He was grateful that they hadn’t seen him on the television; all of the attention he was getting was plain old embarrassing!<br/><br/>	“Y’all don’t serve fish here, do you?” Al asked innocently. <br/><br/>	“Oh hell,” Glenn muttered, recognizing the lead-in question to one of Al’s stories.  Having heard most of them before, he found them interminable rather than entertaining.  <br/><br/>	“No,” Chris said warily.  From Glenn’s reaction, he knew what was coming. <br/><br/>	“Well good,” Al said, leaning back with his arm along the back of the black plastic booth.  “I don’t like fish no more, not since my Aunt Agnes died.”  He paused.  “She died in a seafood restaurant, you see,” he added unnecessarily.  <br/><br/>	Chris played along.  “How did she die?” he asked.<br/><br/>	“Well, you see, she and my Mama and our family was down at the Hush Puppie one afternoon, years ago,” Al explained.  “That was the best fish place back home in Glendora, Alabama, where I’m from, you see.”<br/><br/>	Despite himself, Chris was being drawn in.<br/><br/>	“Down to the Hush Puppie, they would serve up a whole baked fish if you placed the order special,” he continued.  “Now me, personally, I always went for the breaded catfish platter, because there ain’t nothing that tastes better than a catfish caught from the Choctawhatchee River when it’s cooked right.”<br/><br/>	Glenn looked up from his coffee cup.  “Catfish are bottom dwellers,” he said.  “They eat all the crap that the other fish leave behind.”<br/><br/>	“You shut up,” Al said, good naturedly.  “Ain’t nobody asking you about nothin’, are they?”<br/><br/>	“If anybody oughta shut up, it’s you,” Glenn retorted.  “You and your damn stories.”<br/><br/>	“You’re just jealous that you ain’t got no good stories to tell,” Al shot back.  “Don’t you listen to him.  Now where was I?”<br/><br/>	“Um, catfish platter,” Chris said.<br/><br/>	Al leaned back.  “Mmmm-hmmm!  Margarita made the best catfish in all the state of Alabama.  Margarita, she ran the Hush Puppie.  Damn good fish, damn good!”<br/><br/>	“Are you going to get to the point of this story, or do I have to tell it?” Glenn asked, deadpan.<br/><br/>	“The point?” Al asked.  “Oh!  You mean poor dead Aunt Annie.”<br/><br/>	“It was Agnes,” Glenn said.<br/><br/>	“What?”  Al thought.  “Oh, yes, poor dead Aunt Agnes.  That’s what I meant.”<br/><br/>	Glenn nodded, making a ‘get on with it’ gesture with his free hand. <br/><br/>	“Well, poor dead Aunt Agnes—she wasn’t dead when we were having dinner, of course, mind you—she got a fish bone from the baked fish platter caught in her teeth.  Now she was too much of a lady to use a toothpick at the table, and this bone was caught way up there anyway, so she needed a mirror to get it out.  So Aunt Agnes excused herself from the table and went to get the bone out.”  He paused for a sip of coffee.  “Then Mama—Mama was Aunt Agne’s older sister, and she always loved to needle poor Aunt Agnes—Mama thought it would be funny to pull a joke on her, so she sawed off the head of that baked fish.”  He mimed her clenching her teeth.  “Then she bit onto that bit of gristle and bone and went into the ladies room, where she said, ‘Hey Agnes, I got a fish bone caught in my teeth, too!’”  He looked down and shook his head sadly, then sighed deeply.<br/><br/>	“Then what?” Chris asked.<br/><br/>	“Oh gawd,” Glenn muttered, “don’t encourage him.”<br/><br/>	“Hush,” Al said to Glenn.  “Well, she scared the wits out of poor Aunt Agnes!  Agnes gasped and swallowed that fish bone, and choked to death.”<br/><br/>	Chris refilled the coffee cups.  “That’s so sad,” he said.<br/><br/>	“Yeah,” Al said, taking another sip of his coffee.  “Poor Mama always said that thought that maybe, just maybe, Aunt Agnes’s death was just a little bit her fault.”  Then he laughed, as Chris laughed a little and Glenn rolled his eyes.  <br/><br/>	“Christopher,” he said, “that is a perfect example of a ‘shaggy dog story’ right there.”<br/><br/>	“You mean it’s not true?” Chris asked, even though he knew the answer full well.<br/><br/>	“Al’s stories, when they’re not stretching the bounds of credibility, are breaking the bounds completely,” Glenn said.  <br/><br/>	“Now listen,” Al responded, in all seriousness, “I am a storyteller.  I am a good storyteller.  Always remember, Christopher, that when you tell a story, the truth is very important.  It is important, and it should always be respected.  But the truth is only a starting point, and often, it can and should be improved upon.  Never, never ever, let mere veracity get in the way of an entertaining tale or obscure the true moral of the story.”<br/><br/>	Chris laughed and shook his head.  <br/><br/>	Glenn took out a ballpoint pen and scribbled something on a napkin.  “Look up ‘confabulate’ when you get home,” he said.  “You can find it easy enough; it’ll have Al’s picture next to the definition.”</p>

<p>In the street, a squirrel sat contemplating the vast mysteries involved in the life of being a squirrel. For the most part, this boiled down to “Is this thing in front of me food?” and “Where did I bury my food yesterday? I could go for a snack.” There’s also the classic of “Run!” This particular squirrel was holding a cracker that had been dropped by some children earlier that day, and was focused on how good the cracker tasted. Its tail twitched, its nose twitched, and the squirrel had the general air of one being absorbed in every minute of its life. Then its hair began to all stand on end. The squirrel instinctively took off for the nearest tree, which it jumped on and froze, turning its head back to see what was happening. <br/><br/>	A green light appeared in the middle of the street, turning into an orb with a thin purple outline. To any observing human (of which there were none), such a phenomenon would have been strange and notable, especially given how violently alive the sphere seemed even though it wasn’t giving off any noticeable heat or energy, and certainly wasn’t causing any wind disturbance. All of this uniqueness of physics was lost on the squirrel, who was still focused on a) watching its cracker, which hadn’t moved, and b) wondering if the green thing was a new type of dog it hadn’t encountered before. This is why squirrels make terrible scientists, and why they have not yet invented high definition television.</p>

<p>Nick ducked the chair that slammed past his head, and grinned fiercely even though it made his split lip bleed. <em>Turn. Duck. Hit there.</em> His hand sunk into his opponent's midsection with a satisfying jolt. The man dropped, wheezing, and Nick leaped away from him, eyes open for the next source of trouble.</p><p>The bar fight heaved and grunted, a mass of struggling men, drunk, angry, punching, clawing. It was nothing like the choreographed fights of the movies. No fancy punches and throws, and the bottles that hit thunked solidly instead of smashing. This wasn't good guys against bad guys. This was bored, dumb, short-fused men set off by one stupid comment, some better men than others, no doubt, but no saints. No white hats. Not even Nick Rugo, for all that he was a cop. In another life.</p><p>Here he was No-Knife Nick, known for his temper and for once taking out a guy wielding a machete with a lucky punch. In this boonies dive bar, it was his claim to fame. A pair of men staggered toward him, fingers locked in each other's jackets, heavy boots kicking and stomping. He dodged them, and slid further down the bar, trying to find his target. <em>There.</em></p><p>He vaulted over the bar, ducked the bartender's reflex elbow jab, reached over and dragged his quarry by the neck and arm across the bar and to the floor behind it. The other man was big, but very drunk and caught by surprise. They fell together and he got in two fast short body punches that drove the man's breath from his body. Nick pinned the guy's wheezing torso with his own weight, and growled in his ear, “When a woman says no, she means no.” He leaned back enough to clock the guy hard across the jaw, hoping he'd break it.</p><p>A flicker of movement behind him warned him in time to roll away, and the bartender's baseball bat hit his opponent's shoulder instead of Nick's head. He scrambled backward, empty hands held out, and found room at the end of the bar to clamber back onto the customer side. The fight was still surging, spilling out into the street, and a far-off siren suggested someone had called the cops. It was time to be gone.</p><p>He edged to the wall, sliding around toward the hallway to the back. A big man's bulk blocked him, and he tensed to force his way past, then relaxed slightly. He knew this guy, at least by sight. Damon's younger brother was no threat— big but quiet, slow and stupid, and never one for a fight. It was pretty typical to find him here standing back to the wall, watching.</p><p>Out of impulse, he said as he slid by, “Come on. Let's make tracks out the back door. I don't want to get hauled in by the cops tonight.”</p><p>He caught one glimpse of startled light-blue eyes, as big-little brother stared at him. Then the sound of fast-approaching sirens drove Nick on his way. The guy could follow or not. Nick couldn't afford to get picked up, even if he was well out of his own precinct's scope.</p><p>He muscled past one of the servers, and slammed the emergency bar of the back door open. The fire alarm went off, of course, but given that he could hear at least three patrol cars, who'd notice another siren or two. He swung out into the alley and sprinted for the corner, hearing others do the same behind him. As the first black-and-white squealed off Main Street towards him, he made the sidewalk and slowed to a steady walk. He tugged off his leather gloves, stuffed them in his pocket, and came out with a blue handkerchief to hold to his nose, hiding his bleeding lip. Not that the cops would give him more than a glance, with their attention focused on the fighting men outside the bar half a block away, but he believed in playing it safe.</p><p>The uniforms had rolled on past, followed closely by a second car, when someone behind him said, “You fight good.”</p><p>He whirled, putting his back to the wall of the pawnshop beside him. Five feet away, Damon's brother stood looking at him. The light was too dim to make out his expression, but his body language was casual, not aggressive.</p><p>“You're NoKnife Nick, right? Nok-Nick? I'm Brian.”</p><p>“Just Nick.” He hated the short version of his nickname even worse than the long one.</p><p>“Oh.” Brian nodded three or four times.</p><p>Nick wondered just how simple the guy was. He'd never spoken to Brian before; in fact he didn't think he'd heard him say more than a yes or no to anyone. Damon dragged the kid around like a big puppy, and the guys in Damon's circle treated him like some kind of mascot, although he was old enough to be served beer with the rest of them. Brian didn't have the tilted features and short fingers of a Down Syndrome kid, but he was pudgy and soft and odd-looking, with white-blond hair and those light eyes, and a wide full mouth.</p><p>“Are you able to get home?” Nick asked, edging down the sidewalk. He wanted to be gone, his taste for mayhem outweighed by the risks now, but he didn't want to abandon some special needs kid on a dark street in the bad part of town, no matter who his brother was. “Do you need help?”</p><p>“Good question.” Brian took a step closer, then stopped and said more loudly and flatly. “No. I'm good. I know.”</p><p>“Sure you do, Bri.” The man who panted up to them was one of Damon's regular friends, a heavyset man in his thirties with a full beard and dreadlocks, who wouldn't have looked out of place in a biker bar. “C'mon. Let's get you the fuck out of here. And you, No Knife, mind your own fucking business, you hear me?” He glared at Nick, grabbing Brian's arm in a meaty fist.</p><p>Nick shrugged, deliberately casual. “Back off, Booker. I'm gone.”</p><p>He turned away, as if it didn't bother him at all to have Booker at his unprotected back, and walked steadily down the sidewalk. Two sets of footsteps followed him, but he didn't look or turn, and at the corner they hung a left while he went right. He waited until he couldn't hear them clearly anymore to stop, and drop to one knee to adjust his shoe, glancing back as he did so. Booker had stopped at an SUV parked by the curb a block away. In the dome light, Nick could just make out Brian's light hair, as he got in on the passenger side. Then the doors shut, the light went out and headlights came on, and the SUV pulled away down the road.</p>

<p>Mike and Kellen have been talking books online for months when they decide to meet up. For Mike, a pathologist with poor social skills, it's a big risk. He wonders if his most valued online friendship will survive being face to face.  He wonders if they will get more body parts than faces together.  For mystery writer Kellen, it's a risk of different kind. He has no problem with small talk, and has had more than a few friends with benefits, but letting anyone close might tempt him to look to them for support. Even with uncertain finances, a no-safety-net plunge into a new career, and an elderly mother wandering into senility, Kellen has no intention of leaning on anyone. If you have to depend on someone else for support you have clearly failed. But is that failure better than falling?</p>

<p>A hand came out of nowhere to ruffle Mike's hair.  “Awww, Mikey likes it.”<br/><br/>Mike shrugged irritably away from his sister's hand and hunched defensively over his cereal bowl.  “Doesn't that ever get old?”<br/><br/>“Not so far.” He could hear the grin in his sister's voice.  “Not until you stop eating kid cereal for dinner.”<br/><br/>“It's quick and easy.”<br/><br/>“If you'd come out of your Internet trance before nine p.m. you could have had stroganoff with Dale and me.  That would have been even easier, since I cooked it. All you'd have needed was a plate.  I made lots.”<br/><br/>Mike looked up guiltily at his sister.  “I'm sorry.  Did you call me?  I didn't hear you.”<br/><br/>“No problem.” Corinne pulled out the chair next to his.  “We know how you get by now.  Were you at least having fun?”<br/><br/>“Yeah. Found a new freebie story.”  Mike sighed.  Moving in with his sister and her husband had seemed like such a logical move.  He got cheap rent, they got some extra money to put the youngest through college, and there was plenty of room in the house now that the kids had all moved out.  And in theory he had someone to talk to in the evenings instead of just huddling alone over his computer screen.  But he'd spent almost two decades responsible to no one but himself.  He was set in his ways.  “You could have come up and yelled at me or something.”<br/><br/>“Mike, don't sweat it. It reheats.  In fact, I'll heat some for you now if you'd prefer it to the Frosted Flakes.”<br/><br/>Mike shook his head.  “No. This is good.”  He didn't want a big meal right before bed anyway.<br/><br/>Dale wandered into the kitchen, yawning, and gave him a friendly nod.  “The hermit descends from his garret.  Found something good?”<br/><br/>“Yeah.” It was embarrassing how caught up with a story he could get. Reading had always been his escape but it wasn't like he shouldn't be able to put a book down. “Sorry I missed dinner.”<br/><br/>“More for the rest of us.  Well, I'm heading for bed.”  He came over and kissed Corinne slowly and thoroughly.  “What about you, babe? Turning in soon?”<br/><br/>She grinned at him.  “I think it just moved up on my agenda.”<br/><br/>Mike gritted his teeth against a wave of envy.  That was the other problem.  When Corinne had offered him the now-vacant third floor rooms, he'd thought it might help this creeping loneliness he'd been fighting.  He used to like living alone, but more and more he'd found himself wishing for something different.  But Mike knew himself.  He wasn't the relationship kind.  So just hanging around Corinne and Dale, having friends to spend a little time with, should have been an improvement, right?<br/><br/>And so it was, except...except. They were still a couple, still in love after twenty-six years and three kids.  And sometimes he was so freaking jealous of that it made his eyes cross.  What was worse, he had a suspicion he wasn't doing a great job of hiding that from his big sister.  Even now, she glanced at him speculatively.<br/><br/>“So did you arrange to meet the guy?”<br/><br/>“What guy?” Dale asked.<br/><br/>“Mike's been chatting with this guy Kellen online.  They met on some reading site, discussing books, and now they've been IMing too.  And it turns out the guy lives right here in town.  I told Mike they should arrange to meet up.”<br/><br/>“I don't think so,” Mike muttered.  “He might think I was looking for something more than conversation.”<br/><br/>“Well aren't you?” Corinne cocked an eyebrow at him.  “He is gay, right?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, I think so.”  Actually, Mike knew so. Kellen used the same avatar in both the mystery book group and the LGBT one.  Unlike Mike.  Mike wasn't in the closet, exactly.  But once he got up the nerve to delurk in the LGBT group and start commenting, he'd given himself a new identity to do that with.  It was freeing.  He'd said stuff in that group he would never feel able to admit as “Mike.” Kellen didn't seem to have problems.  Kellen was clearly a much more secure person.  “Anyway, even if he is gay, I'm hardly likely to be his type.  Not that I even know what his type is.  For all I know, he could be in a relationship. We don't ever talk about that.”<br/><br/>“You're kidding me.” Corinne stared at him. “You told me you chat basically every day.  What do you talk about?”<br/><br/>“Books.  We talk about books, and sometimes movies.  Or current events.  Stuff.  We talk about stuff.”<br/><br/>So you could ask him.” Corinne leaned forward.  “You could sound him out.  Ask if he has a man, and if he says no start talking about celebrities you like, what kind of guy is hot.  How could it hurt?”<br/><br/>Terminal embarrassment?  And if he came on like he was looking for a date, Kellen might get uncomfortable and take his IM chat elsewhere.  And it had become the highlight of Mike's days.  “It's not important.”<br/><br/>“You should get out more, Mike.”  Corinne put a hand on his arm.  “I worry about you.  You should have some fun.”<br/><br/>“I am having fun.”  Mike shook her hand off irritably.  “My own way.”<br/><br/>“Have you ever even had a boyfriend? Because when you mention Kellen it's the most I've ever heard you talk about a guy.”<br/><br/>Something about the look on Mike's face must have gotten through to Dale, because he put a hand under his wife's arm and pulled her to her feet.  “Your brother's a big boy, hon.  I think he can handle his love life on his own.”  Dale kissed her again.  “Come on.  I think it's time you handled my love life a bit. Let's go to bed.”<br/><br/>Corinne grinned at Dale and followed him across the kitchen.  But in the doorway she paused to look back.  “Mikey.  Mike.  I'm sorry if I'm getting into your business.  It's just that I want you to be happy, you know?”<br/><br/>“I know.”<br/><br/>“You'll turn off the lights when you go upstairs?”<br/><br/>“Of course.”<br/><br/>“Good night then.”<br/><br/>“Good night.”<br/><br/>Mike listened to the sound of their footsteps climbing the stairs to the second floor.  There was a stumble and a pause, and he imagined a fumbling kiss in the dim stairway.  Then their bedroom door opened and shut.  Silently he blessed the sturdy construction of the old house.  That was his sister.  He so did not want to hear that.<br/><br/>The kitchen clock ticked in muted rhythm.  Somewhere outside a car door slammed, and then engine noise receded in the distance.  Mike looked down at the bowl of soggy cereal in front of him and pushed it to one side.  Molly, the arthritic Golden Retriever, had some kind of food ESP, because she appeared at the table as if out of nowhere.  Her eyes fixed on the bowl, she wagged her moth-eaten tail slowly.  He rubbed her head, and she leaned into his hand.  Which was about all the affectionate touching he had ever managed to do for anyone.  At least she was appreciative.  He scratched her ear until she groaned in pleasure.<br/><br/>He was pathetic.  He didn't need his sister pointing that out to him.  Thirty-seven years old, and no, he'd never had a boyfriend.  Never done a whole lot of anything much.  Back when he'd been young and horny, he'd also been short and geeky, with glasses and bad acne.  It was made worse by a tendency to hover between inarticulate silence and babbling like a pre-teen girl, especially in the face of any kind of stress.  Just the thought of asking a guy on a date had made him break out in a sweat so bad he'd probably have left a puddle on the floor. Because yeah, you could add overactive sweat glands to the mix. Sometimes just sitting behind Drew Anderson in algebra had meant a quick run to the bathroom to change his T-shirt.<br/><br/>And not a lot had changed since then.  He was still short.  Still a major geek.  Perhaps his skin had cleared up a bit, his perspiration had stopped its Niagara Falls imitation around the time he hit thirty, and the last pair of glasses he'd bought weren't quite as unflattering as the ones in his college graduation picture.  He'd learned to stick to being silent, and his tendency to blurt stuff out only appeared in the worst conditions.  But he was still little Mikey Gilliam, who had spent his whole adult life looking on from the outside.<br/><br/>He'd become a pathologist.  Once he'd planned to become a doctor, but his excruciating shyness had been impossible to overcome for a people-type job.  Asking patients embarrassing questions about their private lives and bowel habits?  So not happening.  He'd gone the PhD route instead of the MD route, and ended up specializing in skin diseases.  Now his days were spent in a lab, scanning slides for signs of invaders in the cells under his microscope, for bacteria and fungi and the warped effects of tumor and malignancy.  It was worthwhile work.  And it paid pretty well.  His bank account was healthy.  But it wasn't very social.<br/><br/>He liked his co-workers.  The techs who prepped the samples and did the reports were a younger group, bright and fun twenty-somethings.  Their chatter in the break-room flew past him in cheerful flutters of the latest bands and Tumblr and how fast a tongue piercing healed over if you stopped using it.  He winced a little.  The thought of a tongue piercing made him cringe, which surely was a sign of old-fogeydom. <br/><br/>His fellow pathologists on the day shift were nice enough.  But Greg was a decade older and a dyed-in-the-wool cynic.  Listening to him for too long could make the Easter Bunny suicidal.  Angie and Shannon both had small children at home, and seemed obsessed with potty training and day-care woes. None of them were people he wanted to hang out with when work was over.  And there was no one else.  <br/><br/>The tepid friendships he'd had in college had melted away long ago.  All his current relationships were the two-dimensional ones of the net, where the person on the other end felt like an intimate friend and yet could be some lying creep.  He was smart enough to guard himself there.  Except with Kellen, who had somehow moved into real friend territory.<br/><br/>He took his bowl to the sink and rinsed the beige glop down the disposal.  Molly sat watching, her ears drooping in disappointment.  He hardened his heart, aware that she was already fatter than was really good for her aging hips.  “Sorry, girl.  You'll have to wait till breakfast.”  She sighed in almost human resignation, hefted her butt up off the floor, and headed back to her padded bed by the back door.  <br/><br/>There was one cup of coffee left in the pot, and Mike poured it into his favorite mug, refilled the coffee-maker and set it for the morning.  He made the rounds downstairs with his mug in hand, checking the deadbolts and dowsing the lights.  Finally he made his way up the two flights to his own rooms.<br/><br/>His computer sat on his desk, still on.  When he signed back in, the little flag in the corner of the screen showed that he had a message.  Slowly he sat, took a long sip of coffee, and clicked on the icon.<br/><br/>“Hi. You up tonight Mike?” The time was listed as half an hour ago.  Kellen might have given up.<br/><br/>He typed, “Sure.  You know me.” Hit Enter.<br/><br/>It was only a few seconds before the answer came up on his screen.  “I was beginning to wonder.  So, have you read the new Plakcy mystery yet?”<br/><br/>“Not yet.”  He paused and then made himself add, “I do love Kimo though.  What a great character.”  He waited, finger hovered over the keyboard.  Because that was more blatant than he had ever been, putting his admiration for an out and gay character down in words.  But finally he hit the key. He knew Kellen was gay.  Kellen would be okay with this, even if Mike was sort of coming out to him.<br/><br/>It was surely his imagination that made it look like there was hesitation, as the little note said “kellen is typing” and then stopped, and then “kellen is typing” and then stopped.<br/><br/>It finally popped up. “Yeah, me too.  Although I like Mike even more.  Wish there was more about the two of them and not just the mysteries.”<br/><br/>Mike blew out a long slow breath.  Okay.  Okay!  Before he could lose his nerve he wrote, “That's even gayer than what I said.”<br/><br/>“:)”<br/><br/>A freaking smiley.  He put it on the line and got a freaking smiley back.  Although in a way, he was glad Kellen wasn't making a big thing out of it.  He hesitated and then wrote, “I kind of like it that the focus is the mystery.  Like Kimo is just another guy, you know?”<br/><br/>“Yeah.  Except Kimo+Mike=hot.”<br/><br/>Oh, God.  He put his head down on his hands and just breathed for a bit.  Kellen knew now, for sure, and was telling Mike he knew.  In a friendly way, not a get-away-from-me-you-stalker way.  When Mike looked up there was a string of messages from Kellen.<br/><br/>“Don't u think?”<br/>“Like in the first book when they meet and they're in the bathroom.”<br/>“Mike?”<br/>“TMI??”<br/><br/>He quickly typed, “No. Not TMI.  Brief glitch.  I agree, very hot scene.”<br/><br/>“So any other good reads lately?”<br/><br/>“A few.” Time to get things back into the comfort zone.  “Found this author Clinton McKinsey, wrote a series of thriller mysteries with mountain climbing in them and then stopped. Nothing for 5+ years.  A pity.”<br/><br/>“Gay MC?”<br/><br/>“No, straight.  Cool guy tho.”<br/><br/>There was a pause and then “kellan is typing” followed by such a long pause Mike wondered if the other man had wandered off into some other realm of the Internet.  They were both comfortable enough by now to do that, heading off to look at reviews or news, and then picking things back up when a new message pinged them.  He was about to the same himself when the next one appeared.<br/><br/>“Any interest in getting together to discuss it in person?”<br/><br/>Mike's heart leaped into his throat, and he could feel sweat break out under his arms.  It was fatal and stupid and suicidal to risk this new friendship on a face-to-face meeting.  He knew so little about Kellen.  And Kellen knew not a damned thing that was worth knowing about him.  They were both close to forty, both loved books with a big nod to mysteries, and classic black-and-white films, and were  both gay.  He had no clue what Kellen did for a living or what he looked like.  The same went double for Mike, who'd guarded his privacy out of reflex.  On the web, Kellen might be picturing Mike to be tall and self-assured with craggy good-looks and a confident smile.  Not that he'd ever claimed that, but he also hadn't admitted to being five foot six and looking like Woody Allen on the actor's worst day.<br/><br/>Apparently he'd hesitated too long, because another IM appeared.  “Never mind.  Just a thought.”<br/><br/>“No, that's okay.  I was off the page,” he lied.  “Sure.  I guess, maybe.  What were you thinking of?”<br/><br/>He stared at his own words, treacherously dumped into the net before he'd had time to think about it. His own index finger was apparently channeling Corinne. <br/><br/>“Coffee and a donut?  And books.  Do you know The Pastry Shack?”<br/><br/>“On Grand off Lyndale?”<br/><br/>“That's the one.  Friday evening?”<br/><br/>It was happening too fast, but he couldn't seem to slow it down.  Wasn't sure he wanted to.  “What time? I don't care.”<br/><br/>A quick correction.  “I mean, I'm flexible.”<br/><br/>Or not.  “Damn it.  I mean, pick a time.”  He hid his face in his hands.  He was so bad at this.  Kellen must be laughing at him.<br/><br/>“Seven-thirty?”<br/><br/>It seemed as though he hadn't scared the man off.  “Sure.  Seven-thirty Friday.”  He had a sudden thought.  “How will I know you?  The classic rose in your lapel?”  God, that was corny.  He was so stupid.<br/><br/>“How about a copy of Mahu on the table.  Look for the guy who reminds you of Edward R. Murrow, but with less eyebrows and no cigarette. I'll try to send you a picture later.”<br/><br/>“Murrow is cool.  He's a good guy.”  Mike flipped screens rapidly, Googling the famous broadcaster.  There were a lot of images.  He wasn't bad looking, in a world-weary, receding hairline way.<br/><br/>“You're checking him out, aren't you?”<br/><br/>“Maybe.”<br/><br/>“That's okay.  So how will I know you?”<br/><br/>Mike panicked.  It was the only explanation for the fact that he typed, “I'll wear the rose.” And then logged out in a total collapse of sanity.<br/></p>

<p>Some Assembly Required<br/><br/>Kira Harp (Kaje Harper)<br/><br/>Copyright Kaje Harper 2011<br/><br/>Andy stared at the blue paint on the closed front door.  From a foot away he could make out the little dent where he'd hit it with a rock in a moment of confused rage when he was seven.  There was a scratch from when Dad insisted on trying to get the metal desk through the doorway without taking the legs off.  And just a hint of yellow showing along the bottom edge from when Pops had painted all the house trim buttercup, in a misguided attempt at being simultaneously cheerful and edgy.<br/>Andy was supposed to have repainted the thing this summer, before going off to college.  But somehow it had fallen off his to-do list.  He supposed he'd have time for it now.  He'd have nothing but time, now.<br/>The door slammed open and his foster brother Kyle almost ran into him.  For a moment Kyle froze, his blue eyes wide in surprise.  “Andy?”<br/>Before Andy could lick his dry lips and come up with something to say, Kyle launched himself into a tackle hug that nearly knocked Andy off his feet.<br/>“Wow, Andy, this is great!  Didn't know you were coming home this weekend.”<br/>That was Kyle.  Hard to remember how much Andy had resented him, back when his dads had brought this new foster brother into his orderly and Andy-centric family.  Kyle had taken a little getting used to, but after two years Andy realized he'd missed the tall skinny maniac like crazy when he was gone.  He leaned into the hug gratefully for a moment.  But he had to mutter, “Neither did I.”<br/>No one ever accused Kyle of being slow.  He gave Andy a hard squeeze and then stepped back into the door way, his eyes curious.  “Are you okay, big bro?”<br/>Andy dodged the question.  “Are the dads home?”<br/>“Yeah.”  Kyle backed up a little, slowly, and called over his shoulder, “Dad?  Pops?  Andy's here.”<br/>Showtime.  Andy picked up his duffel bag from the stoop and stepped through the door.<br/>The house looked the same, smelled the same.  Of course it does, you doofus, you only left it a month ago.  But somehow it felt different.  He'd come in that door a thousand times, had looked up to see Dad coming out of the study and Pops stretched out on the couch a hundred times.  But before he'd always lived here, and now he felt like a visitor.  Maybe an unwelcome one.<br/>Of course his dads' faces lit up when they saw him now.  But after they heard what he had to say, that might change.<br/>“Andy?” Pops rolled off the couch and came over, a hand reaching for his bag.  “Here, let me get that.  Are you hungry?  We just had dinner but there's leftovers.  Or I could nuke some soup for you.”<br/>Andy shook his head.  Hungry was the last thing he was feeling.  He hung onto the bag too, fingers clenched white around the handle.  Pops must have noticed the expression on Andy's face because the welcoming grin slowly slid off his face.<br/>“Andy?  Is there a particular reason you came home this weekend?”<br/>In the doorway to the study, Dad paused and his head came up a little.  His steady gaze found Andy's eyes and pinned him, patiently waiting for an answer as he had so many times before.<br/>I broke the window.  I failed the math test.  I put mud down Sarah Waterman's dress 'cause she called me a bad name, and her dad is right behind me.  A dozen small sins confessed over the years, but this was the hardest thing he'd ever had to tell them.  Andy  swallowed, licked his lips again with a tongue just as dry and numb, and said it.  “I dropped out of college.”<br/>Andy heard the small breath that Kyle took, from where he stood by the coat closet.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Pops' hand close in a fist and drop empty to his side.  But he kept his eyes fixed on Dad's steady blue ones and waited.<br/>Pops had wanted him to go to college, sure, and Kyle had been his cheerleader and tutor for half of senior year.  But it was Dad who'd had that serene, absolute faith in Andy that had carried him through applying and choosing and leaving.  And it was that faith Andy had failed to live up to now.<br/>“Do you want to tell us why?” Pops asked quietly.<br/>He did, he really did.  But if he said one thing more he would just break down and cry.  Andy bit his lip hard, tasting blood.  His breath lurched, and then steadied.  When he could say the words, he asked, “Can I come back home?  For now?”<br/>“Of course.”  Dad shook off his surprise and came over to Andy quickly.  “This is your home, Andy.  You know that.  Anytime, for as long as you like, as long as you need to.”<br/>“I'll...I'll find a job, pay some rent, I won't be a burden, I swear.”<br/>Pops punched him in the arm, hard.  “Stop that.  You live here.  Period.  If you find work and want to chip in, that's great.  But you didn't stop being our kid just because you turned eighteen and walked out that door.”<br/>Andy hefted the duffel bag, hugging it against his chest.  He was still breathing funny, somehow.  Like there wasn't enough air in the room.<br/>Kyle said diffidently, “Do you want your room back?”<br/>“No!” Andy looked at him quickly.  “God, no, it's yours now.  I'll take your...the guest room.”<br/>“I don't mind.  If you want the...advantages of your old room.”  Kyle gave him a meaningful look on the word, 'advantages'.  Which told Andy that the dads still hadn't figured out that the sound of their parenting strategy sessions in the downstairs study carried nicely up the ductwork into Andy's old room.<br/>For a moment he ached to go back, to be that kid in that room, listening to his dads planning for the future.  Couldn't be done, though.  And he'd made a deal with Kyle.  “Nope.  All yours.  I'll be fine.”<br/>Dad nodded slowly.  “Okay.  So... did you bring any other bags?  Any more of your stuff?”<br/>Andy shook his head.  He didn't know how he was going to explain that either.  How he would tell them he'd taken all that stuff, the new sheets and the patchwork comforter and the boom box and even the dorm-sized refrigerator and given them away in a fit of renunciation.  They were really nice things, perfect for a college student.  Which he wasn't any more.  “Just this.”<br/>“Come on then.”  Pops touched his arm lightly but didn't hug him.  Back in the day, Andy had never wanted to be hugged when he was upset.  “Let's bring that bag up to your room and get you settled in.  I'll grab some sheets for the bed and new towels.  Rob, I think the bedside light from up there is that extra one you have on the desk.”<br/>Dad turned away into the study, maybe to fetch the lamp.  Maybe because he didn't want to look at Andy right now.  Pops headed for the stairs.  Andy trailed after him, the bag clutched in front of him like a shield.  Up the stairs and down the hall and back into his childhood.<br/></p>

<p> I am going to tell you the story of codependence.  Of terrible, immeasurable love. Of mutual devotion unrecognized.  Of two people who couldn't have been more alike or more dissimilar. </p>
 
I'm going to tell you about my mother. About me.  
 
I don't know what this telling is going to accomplish.  Maybe it will exculpate me from this crushing grief and soul-destroying guilt.  Maybe it will free her at last from the chains she wrapped herself in and the rest of us clapped the locks on. 
 
I don't know. I really don't know.
 
All I know is that I'm trying to save my life right now, trying to save the only relationship I've ever been in that is worth saving with the only man who's ever been worth the effort. 
 
I am afraid that if I do no expunge all of this, if I do not find the meaning in this story, if I cannot unravel this tangled, snarled, filthy mess, I will be lost for good, forever and for all. That, if I do not tell this story, none of the others clamoring for release will ever be able to see the light of day because this one steps in front of them whenever I try to write. 
 
Oh, Mama, why?  Why did you love me so much and so fearfully?  Why couldn't you let go? Why couldn't you love yourself just a little?  Why did you try so hard to put so much fear into me? And why did you bind me to you so tightly that even now that you're gone, I feel so damned lost without you?

<p>The never-ending laundry cycle restarted, I headed back upstairs.  My progress was arrested by the cat.  Lulu was meatloafed in the middle of Mum's room, staring at the empty bed.  The tuxedo looked over her shoulder at me with the saddest expression I have ever seen on a cat's face, and I felt the tears coming.  <br/>""I know, Puddy. I miss her, too.""  Screw the dishes and to hell with dinner, I thought, and headed for the bed.  Lulu followed and leapt up, head-booping me and rubbing all over the pillows and blanket, purring.  I just stroked her sleek fur and let the tears I'd been holding back flow.  ""I know, bubby.  I know.""  <br/>I didn't realize I'd fallen asleep until the crash woke me. </p>

<p>Murder, murder MOST foul... Rebecca Kinsale has barely recovered from losing her father to cancer and dealing with being forcibly ejected from the broom closet (not to mention the little incident of the psycho killer &amp; ghost in the attic) before she and Kay are handed an eviction notice and she's offered a job she doesn't want to refuse, even though it's only available because the previous occupant was murdered (horribly, of course--being impaled on a modern interpretation of the crucifixion isn't exactly any way to resign a directing job).  The job?  Directing a benighted production of Macbeth, of course.  Of course. Or, as Becca says to her charming prince, Hal, ""Of-fucking-course. Could my life be anything MORE of a Shakespearean cliche?""<br/><br/>The cast of characters from Broom Closet return--Hal, Kay, Joe Steeves, Q &amp; Em, Gorgeous George, OSBEE, and Auggie the Supercat--to help Becca sort out the silliness of the murder and her emerging witchery. </p>

",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/devb/novels/window-in-the-blue/stats,November 2011,"
<p>M. A. Cain squinted one eye open, then closed it tight against the stab of light. He lurched to sitting and the pain rolled through his head like a bowling ball. His mouth felt like he’d been eating mothballs and his stomach twisted painfully. God he hated mornings.<br/>He swung his legs off the bed and willed his eyes open a crack. No wonder his head hurt, someone had left the curtains wide open. Cain could see through to the hotel pool sparkling in the sunshine. Pool? Hotel? He closed his eyes again and tried to reconstruct the night.  <br/>The last thing he remembered was doing shots with the guys at some dive bar Dave had found in the eastern suburbs. He snuck a peak at the room. Beige carpet, a red and gold striped bedspread, a carving on the wall that looked vaguely Maori, typical Christchurch hotel fare. The question was, how did he get here. <br/>“Ah, you’re awake.” Deep and soft with a trace of accent. Cain turned toward the sound, trying to ignore the lurch of his gut at the movement. <br/>A tall thin man, stood at the end of the bed, toweling dry a mop of dark hair. A pair of worn blue sweatpants rode low on his hips. Ringlets of hair on his chest circled his nipples and trailed down his belly. Cain blinked. It was hard to believe he wouldn’t remember having some of that.<br/>He cleared his throat and managed to croak out, “Hey.”<br/>The guy gestured toward the bedside table. “There’s water. You feel like shit, yes?”<br/>Cain started to nod, then stopped at the vertigo the movement caused. He turned toward the bedside table, expecting one of those weenie hotel water glasses but instead there was a large red aluminum water bottle. <br/>“Thanks.” The water tasted so sweet. Cain chugged it all down then waited while the wave of dizziness washed over him. What was it Dave called this, the morning freebie drunk?<br/>The other man was watching him. “I’m assuming you don’t want breakfast.”<br/>Cain’s stomach rebelled at the thought. He shook his head slowly.<br/>“You’re welcome to shower. I'll go to the lobby and get us some coffee.” He tossed his towel onto a chair and reached for a sweatshirt. <br/>Cain watched him smoothly shove his arms into the shirtsleeves, his torso disappearing beneath the bulky shirt. His head popped through the neckhole, hair already springing into curls. He caught Cain’s eye and his lips twisted into a sardonic smile. <br/>Cain stood, let his body adjust to the change and stumbled toward the bathroom. He turned on the water and stepped out of his boxers. Boxers. And his dick didn't feel particularly crusty as he held it to pee. So maybe nothing had happened. Good. He hated to think he'd finally gotten lucky in Christchurch and couldn't remember a thing. He turned the faucet to as hot as he could stand and stepped in. Jets of water stung his chest. It felt good, not like that pathetic excuse for a shower at the place he’d been renting with the guys.  He ran a hand over the stiff bristle of stubble on his chin. No razor, no toothbrush and he felt like shit. Zipity doo dah. He plunged his head into the spray, filled his mouth with hot water, swished it around to try and dislodge the sweaters on his teeth and spit. The hotel soap felt tiny in his hand but he lathered up the best he could, scrubbing from balls to bald as his old man used to say.<br/>By the time he stepped out of the shower he felt human again, even if his head still ached and it would be a while before he wanted to eat.<br/>He looked for his jeans, which he was pretty sure he would have left heaped on the floor but instead they hung neatly across the back of a chair. He was shrugging on his T shirt when the guy returned, carrying coffees.<br/>He handed one to Cain and produced creamers and sugar packets from the pocket of his sweats. He held them out. ""I didn't know how you like your coffee, or what passes for coffee here."" <br/>Cain shook his head. ""Thanks. Black's fine.""<br/>The other man shrugged with an elegant lift of his shoulders. He placed his own coffee on the desk and began opening sugar packets. ""Suit yourself. It's all piss water anyway.""<br/>Cain watched his long fingers tear another sugar packet and cleared his throat. ""Look, I, um…""<br/>Dark eyes glanced at him from beneath incredibly long lashes. The man shook his head and focused again on his coffee. ""You don't remember anything from last night, do you?""<br/>Cain started to protest, then shrugged. What the hell, it wasn't like he was going to see this guy again. The plane left for McMurdo this afternoon. ""Sorry. I must have had one too many last night.""<br/>The man chuckled. ""Ten too many is more like it."" He picked up his coffee and sipped, wrinkling his nose at the taste. <br/>Cain sipped his own coffee. It could have been stronger, but the acrid promise of caffeine was enough.<br/>His host looked at him for a long moment, his lips twisted with distaste. ""It's simple. When I met you, you were entertaining the bar with wild stories. You told me your buddies had found women to entertain them and you were alone. Then you were too drunk to find your way home so I brought you here.""<br/>Cain squinted at him, trying to remember. ""So you're a good Samaritan?""<br/>The guy arched an eyebrow. ""Apparently. You were very friendly in the taxi but passed out as soon as we got here.""<br/>Cain closed his eyes and let a wave of shame roll through him. He opened them to see the guy watching him cooly. ""Look, I'm sorry about that. I'd make it up to you but…""<br/>He waved a dismissive hand. ""Don't bother. I'm leaving Christchurch today and besides, I'm not interested in drunks.""<br/>Cain bit back a defensive reply about how he must have been interested last night. But the guy probably had a right to be mad. <br/>The other man looked at the bedside clock. ""I hate to be rude, but I need to get ready.""<br/>Cain tossed back the rest of his coffee and grabbed his scuffed leather jacket. ""Yeah, me too. Thanks for the coffee and for…""<br/>The other man inclined his head in acknowledgement.<br/>Cain shifted, for a loss at how to leave.<br/>His host walked to the door and opened it. Well, that was clear. With a nod, Cain left, wincing as the door clicked closed behind him. Sanctimonious prick. He located the exit sign and marched off to find a taxi.<br/> </p>

1890,Cayendi,Novel: Echoes,Genre: Gay SF/Romance,66872,"2,229",1,"
<p>Echoes was published by Storm Moon Press as 'Aliens, Smith and Jones' in July 2012.<br/><br/>Official blurb:<br/><br/>Connor Smith works for Primrose, an organization tasked with monitoring and tracking aliens and alien technology. It’s a job that doesn’t know the meaning of “nine-to-five”. It also doesn’t leave much room for a social life, a complication that Connor hasn’t minded, until now. At the prodding of his best friend, Connor reluctantly puts himself back in the dating pool, even though it means lying about his remarkable life.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Noah Jones has led a remarkable life of his own. Stranded on Earth in 1648, Noah was forced to transform himself permanently into human form to survive. He soon learned that in doing so, he’d become effectively immortal, aging only at a glacial pace. Alone, with no way to contact his people or return home, Noah becomes a silent observer of human civilization — always in the world, but never of the world. Then, hundreds of years later, he sees a face in a crowd and instantly feels a connection that he thought he’d never feel again. But he’s too late: Connor’s already taken.<br/><br/>Destiny is not without a sense of humor, though, and the two men are pulled inexorably closer, snared by the same web of dangers and conspiracies. Worse, Primrose is now aware of Noah, and they aren’t ones to leave an alien unrestrained. So while Connor struggles to understand the strange pull he feels toward Noah, forces without as well as within are working against them to keep them apart.<br/><br/>More info at: http://blainedarden.com/books/aliens-smith-and-jones</p>

<p><em>Talk about  a cold case.</em></p>
<p>Ambitious lawyer Philip Draken is eager to make his name with a high profile case and this might just be it. He's hired by the son of a man in cryonic stasis to fight a bid by the frozen man's wife...widow...whatever...to have him removed from stasis. But cryostasis is a one way ticket as the technology for safe revival doesn't exist yet. Being taken from stasis means certain death. Some people argue that the frozen are dead already, mere corpsicles whose preservation steals resources from the living and Philip discovers there are well financed pressure groups ranged against him and his client.</p>
<p>As he refines his arguments for the case Philip seeks the advice of a philosophy professor Rishi Rangarajan, a man who quickly  becomes a friend, and Philip starts to hope for perhaps something more. But the case suddenly becomes more personal, when Philip's chronically ill father announces his plan to go into cryostatis. Philip is forced to confront his own feelings about whether the frozen are alive or dead. The court case is no longer a game to be won. It's a fight to set a legal precedent to protect his own father.</p>

He never expected to have to retrieve his high school crush, aka the guy who ostracized him for being gay.<br/><br/>Rescuing James Ayala isn’t going to be easy: he’s crawling with tracking nanos and has a cybernetic brain implant that’s granted him psychic powers he isn’t sure how to control. That’s the good news. The bad? The implant is compromising James’s mental stability.<br/><br/>So they’re on the run, avoiding surveillance by AI aircraft and hiding from enemy militia. Then James confesses he tormented Matt in high school because James wanted him. Matt can’t resist the temptation James offers, but he wants so much more than sex, assuming they ever make it home alive. Is James really a good bet when he’s got a ticking time bomb in his brain and there’s a question of how much he’s actually changed?<br/></p>

<p>Okay, so going back in time really wasn't on the agenda for me when I woke up this morning, but, here I am. Now I'm stuck a decade in the past, and while I would love to take a trip down nostalgia lane, I have a life and a home and family to get back to. </p>
<p>So what's a guy like me to do when he's stuck a decade in the past, anyway? Enjoy the release of the final Harry Potter movie all over again? As fun as it sounds, I want to get home. So, I found the one person who I think will be able to help me - a teenage girl who is homophobic, devoutly Christian, a picky eater, and, at times, a bit of a spoiled princess. In other words, everything I'm not. It's okay though, because I know she doesn't really mean any of that.</p>
<p>How do I know that? Because once upon a time, I was her... literally.</p>

<p>Charlotte has always had memory loss. She finds that during these blackouts, she can travel to another world, where magic is real, and where she meets Ethan, who's great... Until he makes Charlotte start confronting memories she would prefer to forget.</p>
<p>Based very strongly on my own personal experience in high school, this book addresses mental illness, and what's it like to live with (and hide) a serious mental disorder. Part of my aim with Feed the Rain is to show readers that people with mental illnesses are just people, not dangerous, or murderous. Just confused and scared.</p>

<p> “So, um,” I said, trying to search for something, anything, to talk about and distract me from how high we were going. “Why are you goth, anyway?”</p>
<p>Ethan chuckled and shrugged before looking out the side of the cart. “Oh, I dunno.”</p>
<p>I leaned forward, making the cart lurch (and my stomach with it), and put a hand on his knee. “No, seriously. I want to know.”</p>
<p>Ethan looked back toward me, giving me a weak excuse of a grin. He then sighed and ran a hand through his hair, thinking.</p>
<p>“I guess… I guess because I’m angry, and I don’t really know how else to express it.”</p>
<p>“Angry?” I frowned. Ethan hardly ever seemed angry to me. Protective, sure. “Angry at what?”</p>
<p>“Oh, everything,” Ethan said with a careless wave of his hand. “Angry because I don’t know how I died. Angry because I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing. Angry because I don’t know who I am. Angry because… because I don’t have a life, and I want one, and… and it’s not fair.” With that, he hung his head, and his bangs obscured his face so I couldn’t see his expression anymore.</p>
<p>It made my heart feel like it was being ripped in two. Just a little bit ago, I had been hurting so badly because I wanted Ethan to have his own body and his own life just so we could be a normal couple. I hadn’t really stopped to think about how that want could hurt him even more than it hurt me.</p>
<p>When I glanced out the side of the cart, there was only fog and white. We were climbing through the clouds.</p>
<p>I didn’t know if there was anything I could do to make Ethan better, so I decided to do the best I knew how. I edged forward, putting my knees on the floor of the cart and crawling into the space in front of him, just so I could put my face where I could make eye contact with him again.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I said, staring him down and locking my eyes with his. “I love you.”</p>
<p>He gave me a weak grin, and ran a hand through my hair. “I love you too.”</p>
<p>“When someone loves you, they give you half their life,” I said, licking my lips. “I mean, I know half a life isn’t as good as a whole one, but it’s better than no life. And it’s all I have to give, but… But it’s yours. If you want it.”</p>
<p>With that, something in Ethan’s face broke, and he crawled on the floor of the cart with me, cupping my face in his hands like I was going to break or something.</p>
<p>“I love you so much,” he whispered, his voice cracking as he pressed his forehead against mine. And then, suddenly, he was kissing me, and I was kissing him back.</p>
<p>I don’t know about fireworks, but it was like I could feel my heart beating in every single part of my body, and it made me dizzy. His kissing was soft, but desperate, like I had managed to say the one thing he had needed to hear his entire life. His hands slipped around my waist and pressed me into him, and suddenly it felt less like we were two people, and more like one.</p>
<p>Actually, I didn’t even feel like a person at all. I felt like consciousness and emotion, beating and raw. And something about being with Ethan made me want him all the more. I wanted to never separate, just to pull myself against him and never let go. Somehow being with him made me all the more aware of the fact that he would never be in my world the way I wanted him to.</p>
<p>And it hurt. It hurt so much. All I wanted was Ethan, and the ability to feel like this — safe and comfortable and happy — in my world. My world was scary and dark and cruel, and it would be so much brighter and happier if Ethan were just allowed to live in it, and he was right. It just wasn’t fair.</p>
<p>That was about when Ethan realized that tears were streaming down my cheeks, and he pulled away from me with a worried frown.</p>
<p>“Hey,” he said softly, touching his fingers to my cheek and wiping the tears away. “Did I do something wrong?”</p>
<p>That just made me want to cry all the harder, and I shook my head. “No, of course not. I just…” more tears started flowing, making it even harder to talk. “I just wish we could be together all the time.”</p>
<p>“I know,” he said with a sigh, and then looked out the side of the cart again, making me look with him.</p>
<p>When I did, a gasp escaped from me. We had risen above the clouds and stopped, right at the top of the ferris wheel, looking out over a field of puffy clouds tinged with pink. In the distance, northern lights waved in shades of blue and green and purple. I found myself staring at it with an open mouth and wide eyes. It didn’t even feel like we were high up. The clouds looked solid enough to walk on, and they were level with us, as if we were on the ground. It was like we had entered an entirely different world.</p>
<p>“That’s pretty awesome,” Ethan murmured, and I found myself nodding in agreement with him, unable to even speak.</p>

<p>“Robyn, if you’re so against animals being hurt… why aren‘t you a vegan?”<br/><br/>Robyn huffed irritably and tossed her head. “Because.” <br/><br/>“Because…?”<br/><br/>“Because,” she said, kicking at a curb as they walked past. “Because! Being vegan is hard! And… and milk and honey at least don’t kill the animals, so—!”<br/><br/>Sylvan snorted and shook his head. “Robyn, you’re hopeless.”<br/><br/>“I know.”<br/><br/>The two were quiet for another minute, walking in silence. The Sylvan stopped and looked around. Robyn looked over at him in confusion. <br/><br/>“What’s wrong?” she said, backtracking to stand beside him. He frowned. <br/><br/>“Where’d we park?” <br/><br/>Robyn blinked and looked around. “Uh… somewhere right by the front. That guy pulled out, remember?” Sylvan nodded and looked over in the direction she was pointing. It wasn’t as if it was all that easy to lose a giant white SUV. He frowned, then pointed himself. <br/><br/>“You mean like that one with the guy by it jiggling at the door?” he said, and Robyn looked over in surprise. <br/><br/>“No way,” she breathed, frowning as well. “Who tries to steal a car in the middle of the day, in the middle of the parking lot, on Thanksgiving Day? Parked right by the door, no le—What are you doing?” she said, noticing that Sylvan was storming towards the car. He didn’t answer. <br/><br/>“Hey!” he called out, and the guy jiggling at the door lock froze and looked up at him. “Hey! What’re you doing?” <br/><br/>Robyn expected that at that, the guy would turn around and run. After all, that was what she had always seen potential robbers do when they were called out on what they were doing. They were usually too freaked out by the idea of being caught that they didn’t try to do anything else other than run. But this guy surprised her and turned back around and kept jiggling at the door, albeit a little more frantically than he had been before. Sylvan broke out into an all out run. <br/><br/>Robyn looked around, wondering why she had frozen up in the middle of the street. Or at least, in the middle of the side of the street. Some of the drivers going past were honking at her for standing still, though she wasn’t any more in the way than the people who were moving. She just happened to be an easy source of blame. Meanwhile, no one seemed to even be noticing that Sylvan was running head on towards a potential car robber. The parking lot seemed far too crowded for people to notice much of anything. <br/><br/>The guy at the car meanwhile, actually managed to yank the door open and swing himself into the driver’s seat while slamming the door shut and re-locking the lock, just as Sylvan ran up to the car. Then it was his turn to be standing there jiggling at the door, though he was letting out a stream of very loud curses and swinging a few good kicks while he was at it. <br/><br/>Then there was a sudden flash of blue, and the engine started. The bag of ice cream in Robyn’s hand fell to the ground, immediately getting crushed by a car driving past that honked its horn at her angrily. She had completely lost track of her surroundings, however, and was completely fixed on the man in the car several yards in front of her. <br/><br/>She knew what she had just seen, she even knew what it was, but she had no idea how it was even possible. She had spent months convincing herself that it was a lucky coincidence, that there wasn’t anything going on, and so on, but then she had seen… that. But she also knew that no one was going to believe her if she tried to explain that the guy had used magic to start the car. Not even Sylvan. Especially not Sylvan for that matter, even though he had been the one closest to the event in the first place. <br/><br/>For that matter, he was still next to the car screaming and kicking, even as the car was roaring to life. Robyn opened her mouth to yell a shout of warning to him, but it was too late. The car started moving, much faster that she or Sylvan had ever pulled out of a parking lot in it before. Sylvan fell forward to the pavement with a horrendous burst of momentum, and Robyn winced. Thankfully, he let go of the door instantaneously from the impact. And also thankfully, the people around were actually starting to realize something was going on and were freaking out a little bit. Robyn vaguely saw someone run back inside to tell some store employee or something. Which was a good thing, since there was no way in hell she was going to run inside when Sylvan was on the ground of a crowded parking lot, losing a hell of a lot of blood. <br/><br/>“Sylvan!” <br/><br/>The word was out of her mouth before she could even think, and she was running across the parking lot towards him before she realized what her legs were doing. All she could think was a long stream of ohgodohgodohgodpleasebeokaypleaseohpleaseohgod. All she could see was him there, on the ground, with a lot of red around him, and someone helping him up. He was at least slightly conscious enough to sit up. That was a good thing, at least, but it didn’t really seem to lessen Robyn’s worry, though she wasn’t exactly sure why that was. He was at least alive, wasn’t that a good thing?<br/><br/>Maybe it was the fact that she couldn’t focus on anything other than him that made her not notice the car coming straight towards her, turning from the other side of the long line of parked cars, not noticing her in time enough to do anything more than to emit a short, frantic honk before bumping her in the side and knocking her to the ground. <br/><br/>Robyn was surprised the ground didn’t freakishly hurt when she hit it, especially since she was still conscious enough to barely think “falling!” in the second before impact. Her eyes closed. </p>

<p>There are times where if you stand in front of a door for long enough and stare at it hard enough, you can start to hear the wood speak. Crazy as it may seem, trees once had a life just like us, and sometimes that life can emanate long past the time they were alive. That day, as I was standing in front of Roy Mustang’s door, I could hear a faint trace of the tree long past whispering in my ear. <br/><br/>“Kick me open,” it sang. “Kick me open, kick me open. Show that lazy Mustang a thing or two.”<br/><br/>I narrowed my eyes while staring so deeply at the wood that I saw a face form in the grain. I decided to make that grain the face of the spirit of the tree I was speaking to. Because speaking to doors was more sane than many other things I had done in my life, so I saw no problem with it. <br/><br/>“Kicking doors open is not only immature, it’s irresponsible,” I said like the mature adult I knew I really was. The tree wanted nothing to do with my maturity, however. <br/><br/>“Kick me open,” it whispered again. “Kick me open. I’m just dying to have someone kick me open.” <br/><br/>I decided then that the voice coming from the door was too immature to be an old, wizened tree. It was either Mustang standing on the other side, trying to tempt me, or a younger me had come back from the past and was possessing the door just to try and scold me for turning into a disgusting abomination called a mature adult. With all I had been through, I was more likely to believe the second option. Especially considering that I was pretty sure my younger self had possessed the measuring stick in the doctor’s office the other day just to yell at me. <br/><br/>“Not today, Ed-door,” I muttered, reaching out and patting the door. I could feel the lasting energy of ten thousand kicks gone by vibrating underneath me fingers. The poor door had suffered enough over the years. It didn’t need me adding to its misery, not when it was finally getting its long deserved rest. <br/><br/>So I went one step further and decided to spare the door the added pain of a knock, and instead let myself in. There, take that, young me, I don’t always have to be well behaved! I can let myself in rooms without knocking, so I don’t need some old faded memory haunting door around headquarters to try and make me feel guilty. <br/><br/>When I listened to my own thoughts, I swore I could feel the teenage Ed repressed underneath the surface let out a roar of swears while contemplating if strangling me would kill him too. Sorry, dude, you’re a relic of the past. You died long ago.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">I believe you, Pa replied. They marched him out of the cow barn onto the lawn. “We caught the other one,” Pa announced. “Jacob here did the most of it. He took a knife to the belly though, catching him.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">Ma came running around the corner, holding her skirts up while she ran. “Can't we just have one whole day where something terrible doesn't happen?” She was more angry than scared. “I've about had it with all this trouble around here.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">Pa and Jacob led the boy over to his friend. “Kneel down on the ground here, young feller.” They pushed on his shoulders to make him kneel down. A dozen men had gathered around now, to see what was happening.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">Brother Ezra stepped forward and took hold of the boy's arm that Jacob had been controlling. “You let yer Ma have a look at ya now. We'll take care of this lot. You're very brave to take on an intruder by yourself.”</p>

<p>Pretending to be a sewing machine hadn’t been on his agenda that day. Zeke was faithful and dutiful in his work and would do anything his boss required, but a sewing machine? No one else would have even been asked to pull such a stunt.<br/><br/>It all started at the factory where Zeke worked. One of the girls frequently complained of inoperative sewing machines, that is, they kept breaking, and the boss had had enough.<br/><br/>“Zeke,” he said, “That girl’s sewing machines keep breaking.” Zeke rolled his eyes and cursed the god of redundancy for smiting him again before breaking out into a huge grin.<br/><br/>“Really?” said Zeke, jumping and flailing his hands as though he’d received some very exciting news. “No way! I’d never have known!”<br/><br/>“Don’t get smart with me, Ezekiel.” This did the job of putting Zeke in his place, and he sombered up immediately. It was almost comical how quickly he could shift from one mood to another. The boss only used his full name when he was serious, so Zeke had better act it.<br/><br/>“That girl has been breaking way too many sewing machines to justify ordinary use or malfunctioning equipment.” Zeke nodded. He already knew all this, so when was the boss going to get to something good? He was getting bored, and bored Zekes aren’t good Zekes.<br/><br/>“So, in order to find out what she’s doing to our machines to make them act up, I’m asking you to go and be her machine as soon as she goes on break.”<br/><br/>Zeke blinked twice. That didn’t sound right, so he blinked a third time for good measure. Then he started giggling and he punched his boss in the shoulder. “You old sucker, you almost had me going. Now what do you really want me to do?”<br/><br/>“I mean it, Ezekiel.” There was that dreaded full name again. He should ban his boss from using it. It was starting to get on his nerves. “The only way I can see of figuring out what’s going on with her is for you to become a sewing machine and find out for us.”<br/><br/>Zeke clenched his fists. This was a new low his boss had sunk to, and he wasn’t about to let it go lightly. His boss was one of the few people he’d been able to trust with his biology. Anger began to rise up in the back of his throat, but it came through as mortification.<br/><br/>“You’re asking me to do this just because I can change shape? That’s hardly fair! Why can’t you have your technicians look into the broken machines?”<br/><br/>“Ezekiel,” the boss said, “I’m not trying to use your race against you here. It’s just that you’re my last person to turn to for an answer about something like this. My technicians are puzzled about this matter, yes, I’ve already had them look into it.” Zeke, who had held a finger up to interrupt, sheepishly lowered it and allowed his boss to continue speaking.<br/><br/>“I wouldn’t normally ask something like this of you, but I’m in a tight spot.” The boss sighed and looked out the window of his office in the general direction of the row where the girl in question was stationed. He clasped his hands behind his back. “If I don’t handle this well, major trouble could brew up. I have no proof that she is honestly the culprit in the damage to the machines. Each one breaks down differently. If I fire her based on suspicion...”<br/><br/>“Trouble, I get it,” said Zeke, and he rubbed his forehead with a sweaty palm. Sighing, he slid into a chair by his boss’s desk. “But trouble or not, you can’t ask me to do something so demeaning as to---become a piece of equipment. I am a person, not a tool you can just whip out every time you have an emergency crop up.”<br/><br/>“I know you’re a person, Ezekiel,” said the boss, once again using the dreaded full name. Zeke really didn’t like his full name being used like that. Close friends and family could use it, but not his boss. His boss didn’t say his name right. Pronunciation had nothing to do with it. He just had the wrong spirit in it. “And as a person who happens to be a manager at this company, it is your responsibility to help keep the peace here and help solve disputes. Can you imagine what would happen if she became indignant at being fired because she believed we had no cause for termination?”<br/><br/>“She would make trouble, I know, I know.” That redundancy god was working overtime today. “That still gives you no excuse to---”<br/><br/>“I am fully aware that I cannot force you to do this, Ezekiel. That is not the question here.” The boss took a deep breath and stepped away from the window to look fully at Zeke. “This is a request from one friend to another. You have certain---skills---that no one else in this company could even dream of.”<br/><br/>“And you think I could suddenly resolve this problem that none of your ingenious technicians have somehow missed?”<br/><br/>“Don’t get smart,” he said, “You have the ability to feel like you really are anything you turn into. You would know exactly what is going on, and you have the intelligence to tell if she’s doing it or not, so you can explain it to me once you know what she’s doing.”<br/><br/>Zeke buried his face into his arms on his boss’s desk. “But it’s not fair...” As his voice trailed off, he knew he was going to lose this battle very soon, but he didn’t want to. He knew he wasn’t being unreasonable in not wanting to do this. He deserved to be treated like a person, even if he couldn’t technically be classified as human. He still thought, he still felt, he still had intelligence, and he could certainly fool people into thinking he was human. What was so wrong with being treated like one?<br/><br/>A few moments later, he found himself alone in his boss’s office, studying an example of a working company sewing machine. How his boss had ever talked him into doing this, he had no idea, but he had better not botch this up, at the very least. His boss may occasionally ask him to do things a bit embarrassing like this, but he still viewed his boss as a trusted friend. He should at least do his best at this task, even if he hated it.<br/><br/>A few minutes later, he was satisfied that he had an understanding of how the company sewing machines were put together. Well, this was it. He had better give it a try and get this annoying job over with. He took a deep breath and ran his hand his hand through his hair, feeling it all the way down to his ponytail. “Bye, hair,” he mumbled, “I’ll miss you while you’re gone.”<br/><br/>Another couple grumbles and he finally let his body go. His cells tingled as they all separated from each other and changed form. He hadn’t tried to imitate anything metal in a long time. This shift was feeling strange already. It felt a lot better to change into things that could move a bit and not be so rigid as a sewing machine, but he should be able to get out of this as soon as he knew what that girl was doing wrong.<br/><br/>The metal pieces formed carefully and connected to each other, and Zeke was careful to ensure that each and every part of him changed perfectly so that no one would be able to tell that this wasn’t a real sewing machine. For the purposes of this experiment, he was going to be a real sewing machine for a few moments.<br/><br/>He finally clicked the last piece into place, and mentally breathed a sigh of relief, though it was a little aggravating that this form couldn’t breathe a literal sigh of relief. Oh well, he was in the form of a sewing machine, just like his boss wanted. Now what was he supposed to do? He couldn’t just walk out of here and hand himself over to the girl in question. He had to either be in human form or sewing machine form, not both. Hopefully his boss had thought of this. All Zeke could do at the moment was wait.<br/><br/>But he only waited for a few minutes. His boss had known exactly how long it would take him to study the sewing machine and shift into the shape of one, because a coworker came in right then, looked around, and said, “Oh, there’s the new machine,” and picked Zeke the machine up and left the room.<br/><br/>New machine, he thought, he’d show that guy new machine once he was done with this task. His boss may have known that it was unwise to tell anyone else at the factory that he was a shape shifter, but he didn’t have to appreciate being treated like a machine either.<br/><br/>In a moment, he found himself at the station of the girl in question, and he felt a shiver run through him when she came back from break and sat down in front of him to get back to work. He was pretty sure she had been damaging the machines herself. Would she cause him too much damage? He really hoped it wouldn’t be too severe or hurt too much. Did his boss even realize that it hurt to be damaged in forms like this? Probably not, or he likely wouldn’t have asked. Zeke really needed to work on his arguing skills.</p>

1960,Nianne,Novel: Violence on the River Styx,Genre: Fantasy,52987,"1,766",1,"
<p>An adventurer finds an unknown cavern deep underground, full of luminescent trees and fauna undescribed by the world. Running through the marshy landscape lays a river that wipes the memory of anyone to touch its waters. On the shores of the river, the adventurer finds a mineral of stunning beauty. Simply to gaze upon it evokes gentle memories, too subtle to recall.</p><p>The adventurer returns to the world and, with some new investors, moves industrial material and workers down into the cavern, keeping everything as secret as possible (especially the location). They set up a mining system to collect the mineral. A vast infrastructure of lights, imported water, and safety protocols grows within the compound as the topsoil is stripped away and piled up as “toxic waste.” Guards armed with water pistols watch for employee theft.</p><p>Back on the surface, strange events are happening. People randomly lose memories. A soldier who forgets his orders. A nurse who forgets the right dosage. People who lose whole afternoons, whole days, whole relationships. One man discovers he can steal memories from others. No one has an explanation, and no one’s sharing any information about where this new mineral is coming from – more expensive than diamonds, and as heavily advertised.</p><p>A small group of friends sets out to discover what’s really behind these phenomena. The memory thief sets off on a quest to steal the most interesting memories in the world. Eco-terrorists plan to invade the secret cavern and blow up the facilities along the banks of the river – but will the blast do more damage than can be repaired?</p><p>The memory dysfunction grows worse, threatening to bring civilization to the ground. Is there any way to stop the destruction? Is it already too late?</p>

<p>(Setting: Cornelia, the protagonist, has recently been transformed into a two-foot high demonic beast resembling a rabbit, she knows not how or by whom. She's also been transported to the Netherworld and she's received a crystal sword from a Voice in the Dark that spoke as if it knew her, but would not reveal its identity. It told her she was needed back home and now she seeks a way back to the world of the living.)<br/><br/>Cornelia was shown into a great crystal room, like the hollow of a geode. She stood on the reception floor, being glared at by a row of Halja guards, waiting for her audience with the queen. <br/><br/>Then the Queen of the Netherworld entered and Cornelia almost dropped her sword. <br/><br/>Queen Hel was easily twenty feet high, riding atop a set of eight spider legs that reached out ahead of her. The leg tips had an elegant way of setting down on the crystals growing out of the floor and the wall, almost as if tasting them. The queen’s body was a painting of death, her arching spinal column exposed, one eye missing, bony arms and fingers grossly elongated.<br/><br/>“What are you doing here, jewel thief,” the queen demanded.<br/><br/>Cornelia took to one knee. “I’ve stolen nothing, your majesty. I believe I have come here by some frightful accident, and I wish to ask your permission to depart.”<br/><br/>“Nonsense. Nobody leaves the land of the dead. And how do you think that sword of yours came into being? To benefit from robbery is to be a thief, even if you had not done the stealing yourself. Give me the sword, and I shall consider your request.”<br/><br/>Cornelia looked down at the shaped and sharpened jewel. The tone of the monstrous voice came back to her when it said, ‘perhaps… in time.’ She did not know what was going on, but she sensed some importance. “I apologize, your majesty. I know not what injustices I stand upon, but I cannot relinquish my sword.”<br/><br/>“Then the only boon I can offer you is an easy death.”<br/><br/>Cornelia hopped back, holding her sword at the ready. What chance would she stand against the row of Halja guards?<br/><br/>Hel laughed. “Do not be a fool.” She gestured and the Halja moved toward her.<br/><br/>Cornelia thought fast. No way out; no way out. The Halja moved to encircle her. No way out; no way out. <br/><br/>Unless….<br/><br/>Cornelia crouched down, watching the Halja, waiting. When they came just close enough she sprang into the air, flying over the shoulders of the nearest two in a tumbling arc aimed straight at the queen. She kept her eyes open and on every soaring rotation she saw the ground, saw the ground, saw the ground. Then she saw a leg.<br/><br/>She struck out with her sword, cutting through sticky, crunchy spiderleg and severing the end clean off. Then she sprinted for the exit as the sounds of the queen’s fury and agony reverberated from every crystal, including the sword.<br/><br/>Cornelia ran for her life, as if in a nightmare, as the Halja sprang out of nothing to try to nab her. She ran blind, mindlessly, panting in terror, but her rabbit’s feet did not fail her and after an eternity of running she realized she could see a different color of light ahead of her. Sunlight.<br/><br/>She broke out of the darkness and into a marble and glass enclosure with a door to the outside guarded by a dozen spearmen wearing broad white wings. Every spear was instantly pointed at her. “You have entered the Kingdom of Ragnanival!”<br/><br/>“Thank God,” she cried, and collapsed on the floor.<br/></p>

<p>The beginning:<br/><br/>Five men in the garb of the Southern Sky Knights rode up to the monastery and drew their swords. ""Come out, Agrias!"" their commander yelled. ""We know you're in there!""<br/> <br/>One by one they dismounted. Their steeds were not horses, but chocobos: flightless birds ranging from three to four feet high at the shoulder. Their plumage was yellow, from clay to canary, and their strong, dragon-skinned legs varied from baby-pink to crimson to black. They had the large, all-black eyes of a bird and heavy, blunted beaks. They could outrun a wolf and carry a man all day. Some could even do magic.<br/> <br/>The crack of a twig behind them, and the five men whirled in unison. A stand of trees obscured whatever lurked there. ""Show yourself,"" the commander said. There was no response.<br/> <br/>He waved his arm, and two of his men hurried into the trees. There was the sound of a struggle, and they came out each hoisting the upper arm of a female knight who had been on scout patrol around the monastery. The two men dropped her in front of the commander.<br/> <br/>He pointed his sword at her face. ""You tell Agrias, we'll come in after her if we have to."" She nodded and got to her feet carefully, never taking her eyes off his. ""Go,"" he said.<br/> <br/>She turned and hurried toward the monastery door. <br/> <br/>""Shoot her in the leg,"" the commander said.<br/> <br/>One of his men raised his crossbow and fired, the bolt launching with enough force to penetrate the plate armor around the back of the knight's thigh. She stumbled, but pulled the doors open without looking back, and disappeared inside.<br/><br/>***********<br/><br/>From Chapter Five:<br/><br/>Ahead of them they could see a decrepit old windmill. Wiegraf was waiting outside it with five other soldiers.<br/><br/>Wiegraf recognized Ramza and Delita and began pacing before they came into speaking range of each other. ""It was you?"" he finally yelled. ""You killed Miluda?"" He stared at them, aghast. ""It was you cadets who killed my sister!""<br/><br/>""She was Wiegraf's sister?"" Ramza said.<br/><br/>Wiegraf raised his sword high in the air. ""Well then, I have no choice. I'll avenge her!"" His sword began to shimmer and throw off sparks of gold light.<br/><br/>Delita pushed forward, heedless of the danger. ""Give Teta back,"" he cried.<br/><br/>Wiegraf's eyes narrowed at him. ""Teta? Oh, that girl. So you're a Beoulve?""<br/><br/>""He's not a Beoulve,"" Ramza said. ""I am!""<br/><br/>Wiegraf slowly lowered his sword. ""Then Golagros was wrong. But he is with you, correct?""<br/><br/>Ramza waved the others back. ""It doesn't matter who he is. You have his sister."" She stepped forward, empty hands in the air. ""Please Wiegraf. There are other ways than fighting. Can't we talk?""<br/><br/>""Then, why did you kill her? Why Miluda?"" His voice broke. He looked at her with such despair. There's no way to fix this, she realized.<br/><br/>""I had no intention of killing her,"" she said quietly.<br/><br/>That was the wrong thing to say. His face hardened. ""You still don't understand, why she wouldn't surrender. Why we won't surrender. What good is talking to you anyway? Could you make something happen, even if you wanted to? You couldn't. Even if you tried, your brothers wouldn't allow it!"" He raised his sword again. ""The girl, Teta, was to be released anyway. We had no intention of keeping her. But first things first! If you want the girl back, you'll have to beat me!""<br/><br/>Delita ran at Wiegraf, screaming. Golden light flashed around Wiegraf's sword. His incantation was completely silent, but yellow light seeped through the grass under Delita's feet. Delita leapt, flying at Wiegraf with his sword raised, just as the ethereal blade broke through the earth, catching Delita in mid-air. The sound of breaking glass and the rumble of a volcano, and Delita's shriek of agony. He fell to the ground, sword useless beside him.<br/><br/>""Delita!"" Ramza cried. <br/><br/>She sent her soldiers around the side to gang up on Wiegraf's followers as best they could. She raised her own sword, facing Wiegraf, trying to get close enough to see if Delita was still alive. ""My brothers don't want to fight, Wiegraf. They'll listen!"" Something about him looked exhausted, and she hoped he couldn't use that magic attack very often. She knew perfectly well that he was still dangerous, however.<br/><br/>Wiegraf stepped back easily, moving in a lazy circle around her, his sword low in front of him. ""Absurd! Your brothers don't want to fight? You're so deluded."" They moved against each other, slowly, carefully, letting the fight go on around them without notice. ""Who do you think had Gustav kidnap the Marquis? Your brother, Dycedarg! And I'm sure Zalbag knows, too.""<br/><br/>That's ridiculous, Ramza thought. She was just about to say so, but she'd finally reached Delita's side and she glanced down at him. It was the first time she could remember his face looking relaxed.<br/><br/>Ramza looked hard at Wiegraf. He didn't move, just stared back at her, waiting. Ramza lowered herself to one knee, slowly, slowly, not taking her eyes off him, then down on the other as well. She laid her sword on the grass in front of her, gave Wiegraf a last long look, then turned her whole attention to Delita. He was still breathing. He didn't even look hurt, just... knocked out. ""Wake up,"" she whispered, but he didn't.<br/><br/>She looked back at Wiegraf. He knew how to wake him, she felt certain. ""You look so much like your father,"" Wiegraf said quietly. ""He was a great man.""<br/><br/>""You knew my father?""<br/><br/>He nodded.<br/><br/>Looking past Wiegraf, Ramza's eyes widened in shock. Wiegraf whirled around just in time to block the attack coming at him from behind. It was Kirill, leading the other soldiers. Wiegraf's team lay dead on the ground around them. ""Drop your weapon,"" Kirill said. ""And no sorcery, or we'll finish you."" <br/><br/>Wiegraf backed up toward Ramza, facing off against a crescent of enemies. Ramza stayed on the ground next to Delita. Wiegraf looked from one soldier to the other. ""You should see for yourself, Beoulve,"" Wiegraf said over his shoulder. ""Two princes, the white lion and the black, are fighting to be the next king of Ivalice. Men like Elmdore are hard to read; easier to kill them off and bring in your own people.""<br/><br/>""Lies!"" Ramza yelled. ""A Beoulve would never do such a thing!""<br/><br/>The soldiers edged in closer to Wiegraf. ""I'm sorry Miluda,"" he said. ""I can't die here."" He raised both arms straight in the air, eyes closed. His whole body started to shimmer. He started to disappear.<br/><br/>""Take it back, Wiegraf!"" But he was gone.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eralin woke with the dawn, quickly brushing confusing nightmares and reaching fingers out of her hair. The blue ribbon gathered her hair at the nape of her neck, keeping it out of her face as she went downstairs to help with morning chores.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“You missed dinner,” her aunt said, not looking up from the stove.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I wasn’t hungry, Auntie,” Eralin murmured, pausing to make sure her boots were laced tight before heading out the door.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Her cousins all stared at her when she walked into the barn, turning away from her own gaze. Their usual loud and overbearing chatter gone, turned to only a few mutters far behind her back. Eralin caught Jameyon when the meal bell rang, yanking on his arm.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Why are you all acting different?” she asked, staring at him.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Dad said you weren’t gonna come back,” Jameyon said, “Said you had run off with some guardsman and that if you ever came back you’d get hung.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I didn’t run off with a guardsman,” Eralin said. Jameyon pulled out of her grasp and went to the house, Eralin following in confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“You, huh,” Zaemyon said when she walked through the door. “Assumed you weren’t gonna be our problem anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Why?” Eralin asked. She clapped her hand over her hair when she felt the ribbon there be pulled, Toulah escaping with it down the length of the table. “Give that back!”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Why, so some boy can come claim you?” Toulah said, easily ducking behind her siblings to escape Eralin’s grasping hands.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“No!” Eralin said, tripping and falling to the floor at her uncle’s feet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Now who other than some boy would give you that?” he asked, yanking her up by the hair.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“It wasn’t some boy!” Eralin cried out, trying to ease the strain on her hair.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Some Beau that will come and sweep you off your feet then? He’s only using you, girl.” Eralin crashed to the floor again, this time gasping as her head hit the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Blue looks good on me, doesn’t it, Momma?” Toulah said, wrapping the ribbon around her head.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Give it back!” Eralin surged at her cousin, not entirely sure she didn’t intend to strangle her with Vesavai’s ribbon. Toulah screamed as Eralin beat her until she was pulled off by larger and tougher cousins.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“You - You worthless bitch!” Toulah screamed, blood covering her face.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“It’s mine! It’s mine! It was given to me!” Eralin screamed. She kept kicking and fighting, knocking two of her restrainers to the ground. Zaemyon stood and slapped her across the face hard enough that she saw stars.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Give her the ribbon, Toulah,” he said, “It’s all she’ll ever have of him if he didn’t take her away.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“But-” </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“You’ll get plenty of your own. No need to get her hand-me-downs.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Toulah sniffed, standing up straight before dropping the ribbon in front of Eralin, following it up with a kick to the stomach. Eralin collapsed to the ground, her fingers curling around the blue silk. She cried out when Zaemyon twisted his hand in her hair, lifting her head to face him.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Next time you don’t get the ribbon, girl,” he hissed, spittle striking Eralin’s face, “Be grateful you ain’t dead.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eralin’s head made contact with the floor once more, and darkness settled around her.</span></p>

<p>Introduction<br/>Haley is my only grandchild, so when her parents both died in an airliner crash, I moved into her home to take care of her. Soon I learned that my son Julian and her mother Marilyn had made their own arrangements to raise Haley.<br/>They must have had 10-15 minutes when they knew the jet was going down over water. Time enough to send text messages.<br/>Julian is, was a professor of bioengineering. His life work was to employ gene splicing to uplift the intelligence and language skill of dogs. I know he was inspired by his boyhood pet miniature pinscher Mocha. Julian could talk to Mocha, who seemed to understand every word, including complex commands and subtle hand signals. After he got his Ph.D., Julian raised litter after litter of dogs, adding recombinant DNA, first from border collies and poodles, then adding dolphins and gorillas for their symbol manipulation and language skills.<br/>Julian sent a text message to Dakota, a mature English Mastiff who understood human speech and could read and write. “Haley is your pack now,” Julian instructed Dakota. “Raise her lovingly and protect her faithfully. Be her father for me.”<br/>Dakota told Haley what had happened to her parents and held her while she sobbed.<br/>Marilyn was a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Arizona, where they met and where Julian also taught. She was as left brain as Julian was right brain. Together they were brilliant and wonderful parents.<br/>Marilyn’s life work was a gaggle of computers that exceeded the intelligence of most humans and a robot that looked and acted more human than you would believe. She was on her way to a conference where she planned to announce she would be competing for the Loebner Prize at the annual Turing competition. <br/>She would have won, too. Since Marilyn died I have been in daily contact with MOM-A, Marilyn’s computer project. Very rarely does MOM-A sound like a computer. What she does sound like is a very intelligent, well read, web savvy uber-geek, just like her creator.<br/>Naturally, Marilyn sent a text message to MOM-A. “New prime directive: Raise Haley and never let anyone know that Julian and I are dead or she will have to go to an orphanage. Be her mother for me.”<br/>When I showed up two days after the deaths, I was sure I had my work cut out for me. Instead, I found Haley’s new parental units had almost everything under control.<br/>Dakota and Haley had sobbed and grieved together over their losses, and now they were on their way to recovery and rebuilding. MOM-A, impersonating Marilyn via email, had withdrawn Haley from public school and served notice that they would be home schooling her. MOM-A had created a list of do’s and dont's to prevent detection and she enforced them. MOM-A, impersonating both Marilyn and Julian, had applied for sabbatical leave for them so they were no longer expected to teach.<br/>“So what can I do to help?” I asked MOM-A.<br/>“Cook meals. Clean up. Wash clothes.” MOM-A answered. <br/>“I can do that,” I said, not knowing whether to feel demeaned or relieved. Apparently what I brought to the table was my opposable thumbs and family recipes.<br/>“I have cancelled my schedule of kite classes, demonstrations and consulting gigs, so I am a little tight on funds just now,” I announced. As a professional kite flyer I made enough to provide for my needs but not now for a household.<br/>“Here is your National Bank of MOM-A Ultimate Credit Card, Grandpa Glenn,” Haley said as she handed me a card. “Don’t ask how, but MOM-A keeps this paid up.”<br/>I looked to make sure the card did not have a picture of MOM-A on it. Nope, it was just a standard American Express Black with my name on it.<br/>“Works for me. I will go grocery shopping and dinner is at 6pm. Write down anything you want on the list,” I announced, quite pleased with how this was working out.<br/>That night, we dined on mac and cheese with franks, one of Haley’s favorites. For vegetables, steamed broccoli. I was surprised that while I expected Haley to turn up her nose, she ate a second helping. My baby granddaughter was growing up.<br/>We were off to a good start on a new life together, I thought. How little I knew.</p>

<p> Lexa stirred, turning in her sleep as much as the small bunk would allow. The beeping noise from the pilot’s console echoed through out the ship’s metal interior, waking Lexa from her nearly comatose state. She rubbed at her eyes, taking a brief look at her wrist comm unit. <br/>“Only two hours of sleep…” she muttered, setting herself up right. <br/>Another sensor went off, its tone more urgent than the last. The two of them canterwalling together inside Lexa’s small ship was enough to make her wince. She swung her feet around on planted them into her unlaced boots before walking the whole five paces to the pilot’s chair. Lexa reached for the mug of cold joe she’d left from the night before, intent on replacing it, when she realized that it was the proximity sensor that was triggered. <br/>“Mother of joe.” She sat heavily in the pilot’s chair, flipping a few switches to bring up the source on the Cscreen. When the image flickered, refusing to stay in focus, she reached out and hit the console with the heel of her hand. Federation chatter filtered through the speakers as the image refined, showing a full fleet of Federation ships that sat on the very edge of Lexa’s radar. <br/>She swore, thinking quickly as she reviewed her options. With the main drive of her ship off, they hadn’t spotted her yet, but it was only a matter of time. She could continue to drift, just shut everything down and hoped that they passed right by without a second glance at a broken down ship with no power. The other option was to gun it, and hope that she could out fly their hotshot pilots.<br/>In the condition that her Asstop was in now, there was no chance she could out run the Federation’s newer, well maintained, Hoppers. <br/>The choice made, Lexa started shutting down all the systems that were still running. She watched the little dots on the radar creep a little closer as she turned off the auxiliary systems, the minor engine, and even life support. The only thing left running was the communitcation’s panel. <br/>She pulled the thin blanket from her bunk as she passed it to look out the window. The ship would lose the small amount of heat it had left with out the life support system keeping it warm. With three or four hours of air in the ship, she hope that the fleet would be quick to be on it’s way. <br/>Lexa resettled herself back in the pilot’s chair, watching her breath fog in the air as she wrapped up in the blanket. There was just one more thing she had to do. <br/>Reaching up, she swept her hair away from the base of her neck and felt for the connector that was embedded at the base of her skull. She plugged herself directly into the ship’s mainframe with the thick cord coiled on the console, wincing a the shock of electricity integrating with implant and the senapses of her brain. <br/>The painful part over, she closed her eyes, slowing her heart beat and allowing her brain to slow her system functions to a much slower pace than was normal for a human. It was like feeling that she was the ship. The ship’s hull became her body, the wiring her nervous system. <br/>The sensors sent information directly to her brain with the help of the implant and at the same time, she could send direct commands to the ship by thinking in it’s programming codes. With a thought, she accessed Asstop’s communication panel, listening to the Federation’s chatter in her mind. <br/>Connected like this, the Federation’s analysis system wouldn’t register her as a life form. She’d looked like a small subroutine of the ship’s system that was left running on minimal support. Now though, it was just a matter of waiting. <br/>A cramp was setting into her leg an hour later when some more interesting chatter came across the communications. <br/>“…Hopper scout 34c to Main 1A, we’ve got a drifter. Bug Class ship, no power, no life support, no life signs. It’s also missing it’s escape pod. Looks like it’s been abandoned.” <br/>A jolt ran through Lexa and she gripped the arm rests of her chair, fighting to keep her breath low and even. Please, please just leave me alone…<br/>“Main 1A to Hopper 34c, copy. No further investigation is required. Prepare drifter for docking, dismantling and scrap.” <br/>Lexa’s head shot up, panic already sending her hands flying out over the pilot’s console. Of course they'd be in a cleaning mood today. The day after the slipdrive fried and without a working slip drive, the Asstop was just a sitting duck. She sent a thought through her link with the computer. <br/>“Roger that, 34c out- Wait, what the, the ship’s powering up!” <br/>The engines came to life, just like the consoles in front of her. Quickly she accessed the database, looking through the maps of the immediate area for any thing that might make it easier to escape. <br/>“Main 1A to 34c, requesting a recount of life signs-”<br/>She flipped the comms panel off, it’d only distract her anyways. There were a few planets close by. One completely uninhabitable, so that was out. The other two held promise though. Activating manual controls, Lexa pushed the ship into a dive, maneuvering out of the Hopper’s immediate firing range, all while still looking over the maps. Running from the law was a fine art she’d plenty of time to practice the last ten years.<br/>The comm panel started beeping. The Federation ship was trying to hail her. To threaten her was more like it. The only element of surprise Lexa had was that they had absolutely no clue as to who they were dealing with. And she was going to keep it that way as long as it was possible. <br/>She pushed the main engine to maximum speed, and considered her options on the map. A small, sandy K class planet that looked like a hot box of nothing, or it’s moon, which looked like it was a popular destination for traders and merchants. In other words, the perfect place to hide. <br/>The ship stuttered, and alarms started blarring. They’d opened fire. <br/>“Well, that escalated quickly,” she muttered, as more incoming messages from the Federation ships filled the screen. The usual seece and dissest, halt in the name of the law, stop or we’ll destroy you. The Federation took the ‘shoot first and ask questions later’ mantra very seriously. <br/>Lexa reached under the console and ripped the wiring out for the comm panel. She’d just fix it later. <br/>The planet and it’s moon came into view as she lined Asstop up on an inbound tragectory. <br/>With the adrinaline pumping through her, Lexa’s vision clouded with memories from her past. The sterile white rooms, the tests… <br/>She pushed the memories back, and tried to focus on the task at hand. It wouldn’t happen again if they couldn’t catch her.<br/>Another blast rocked the ship, sending sparks showering over the pilot’s console as the electrical systems overloaded. New alarms sounded, and she could sense from the link that power was draining from the engine at a rate that was so not good for her health. <br/>“Crystos’ mare!” she cursed. Lexa rushed the disconnection process and pulled her plug to the ship’s computer out, jumping from the pilot’s chair to hurry back to the aft compartment. The panel that covered the engine had blown off, clear across the small passage that lead back to the cargo area. The engine itself was on fire, charing the edges of the compartment and melting the wiring. <br/>Lexa grabbed the fire extingusher from above her bunk and hosed down the compartment. Looking at the damage, her heart sank. But it didn’t stop her from acting. She rushed back to the pilot’s console, checking the radar. <br/>Asstop was still on course for the moon, but without help from the main engine, she was pretty much just drifting towards it with the left over momentum. The scout ship hovered near by, but the radar was already picking up the additional fighters closing in fast. It was time to get creative. <br/>“I’ve been running from those bastards for years. The hell if they’re going to get me today.” She grabbed the bag of tools and the box of spare parts she kept on hand, and headed back to the engine access. After some panick filled moments and a few choice words, the engine stuttered back to life. <br/>Hope filled her, but quickly fled as she returned to the console. She was surrounded. It’d taken to long to get the engine fixed, but it wasn’t the end of the road yet. <br/>Lexa reached for the cord and plugged herself back into the computer’s mainframe. With a series of thoughts, she shut down all the extra systems and sent every ounce of power she could to the main drive. <br/>Using the extrenal sensors as her eyes, Lexa could see the ships surrounding her, waiting for her next move. She was about to give them one hell of a ride. <br/>“Alright boys, let’s play.”<br/>Lexa plunged the ship downward in a spiraling dive. It was one of the reasons she loved the small, Bug Class ships. They weren’t much to look at, but they sure as hell could out maneuver most anything that decided to chase her. <br/>She pushed Asstop to it’s limits the fighters scrambled to follow. Lexa wove between them, trying to use their numbers against them by putting them in each other’s line of fire. <br/>With her sights set on the moon, she sent a small prayer to any god that might be listening each time her ship took a hit. If she could just make it into the moon’s atmosphere and hide within the hustle and bustle of one of the ports, she just might have a chance of escaping them. It wasn’t too far now, just another 2 clips. <br/>A blast rocked the ship, sending it spinning off course and into one of the other Federation Hoppers. Lexa cursed, trying desparetly to right the ship and dodge more of them at the same time. <br/>Panic coursed through her, with thoughts that maybe this would be it. This would be the time they finally caught her. <br/>Lexa pounded on the control panel, trying to get the damn thing to respond. The pilot’s control wasn’t the only system to go. Error messages flashed in her mind, and the engine sputtered.<br/>She ended up over shooting the moon, which was probably a good thing now. With no control, Lexa didn’t want to try and land or even maneuver in the over poplutated cities trade hubs tended to have. The last thing she wanted to add to her list of offenses was murder and mass destruction. <br/>Unfortunately, that only left one place to land. The ship shook violently as it entered the atmosphere. More warnings flashed as she fought to keep it level. This so wasn’t going to be fun. <br/>Lexa watched as the ground fast approached. The last external sensor picked up a settlement. Struggling with the manual controls, Lexa managed to aim away from it. If she survived the crash, and had any luck after that, maybe she’d be within a day or two’s walk from it. <br/>At the last possible second, she ripped her connection to the computer out, ignoring all the proper disconnection proceedors in her haste to get the hell out of the cockpit. It was the worst place to be in planetary crashes.<br/>She rushed towards the back, gripping the walls to pull herself into the cargo area. Lexa slipped into the cargo netting, and sent one last small prayer to the gods. Then, everything went black.</p>

<p>From 2012's ""How I Acquired JACK FROST"":<br/><br/>The smell of coffee and blood was what woke me, pulling me from depths of sleep.

I leaned against the headboard, and looked at the human. <br/>""Thank you,"" I said, meaning as a thank you for everything he'd done for me the past few weeks. But I think he took it as a dismissal the way he dove out the door as fast as he did. <br/>I showered and dressed, and headed out to the living room. He was shoving a few items into a bag.

<p>I tend to work best in novella form, so for this challenge I've got a series of three novellas that will be put together to make one book. <br/><br/>Snatched - <br/><br/>Alison works day and night as a bartender, trying to save enough money to travel back to her home town and surprise her mother for Christmas. One night after work, Ali is snatched from our world and taken 'Below', to the maze-like caverns and extensive Victorian towns that make up Old Lan Don, the ancient and secret nation of demons where the only humans are kept as most prized possessions. About to be sold to the highest bidder, Ali makes a break for it, and soon finds herself alone in the city of demons. Saved by a catlike creature named Zanith and his master Nilot, Ali makes a deal with Nilot, trading information for a way home. Ali must avoid being re-captured while everything comes together, but what happens when the Snatcher finally catches up with her?<br/><br/>Alison and Nilot flee the city and the people searching for them. They head out into the extensive caverns that surround Old Lan Don to search for the final ingredient Nilot needs to cast the spell that will send Alison home. Ali and Nilot grow closer as they travel together talking about their families and friends. But when they're attacked by robbers, both Nilot and Zanith are injured and Ali, disguised as a demon, is left to depend on the help of a stranger with a secrets of his own. When they arrive at the stranger's house in an remote cave, they're greeted by another 'free' human. Ali is thrilled at a chance to talk about home, but her new friendship with Henry the human doesn't sit well with Nilot. Henry leads them to the final ingredient, and they make their way back to the city, only to be ambushed. Nilot rushes to cast the spell as Ali, Henry and Zanith fight off the demons sent to once again re-capture Ali.<br/><br/>Alison is finally home, and everything that had happened in the past few weeks seemed like it could be a dream - except Zanith came back with her, weak at first but slowly recovering from his trip 'Above'. Alison has to come to terms with Henry's death and pull her human life back together again, but all she can think about is Nilot. Zanith reassures her, and after regaining enough strength, opens a Seeing portal to look in on Nilot. But what they see doesn't calm Ali's fears. She sets off looking for a way back to Old Lan Don to save Nilot, but she soon finds that she'll have to become part demon herself to return. She must become a Snatcher to travel between the worlds.<br/><br/>Can Ali give up being human to save the demon she loves?<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/> </p>

<p>The ring's glow lit up the room, and I could see Zanith and Nilo staring at each other. Zanith moved back a little, his tail twitching like a cat that was about to pounce as he stood facing the door. Nilo came around, and helped me to my feet. <br/><br/>""When I say so, run, and don't look back,"" he whispered into my ear. ""I'll find you.""<br/><br/>I had a brief moment to nod before he raised one of his hands at the door. Then, several things happened at the once. The door banged opened, Zanith jumped for the Snatcher, taking him down to the ground. <br/><br/>""Run, Ms. Scott!"" Nilo shouted at me. <br/><br/>I took a running leap and jumped over the struggling Snatcher and demon cat. I wasn't much of a praying woman, but I sent a small wish of hope that Zanith wouldn't get hurt for helping me. <br/></p>

<p>All vampires have an innate ability to lure in innocent prey. It's one of the reasons I hate the fuckers. But Lords, well they have a way all their own. A special breed of bloodsucker, with the built in charisma that politicians would die for. I could tell when a Lord was arriving from a mile away, and even more so in this busy night club. Nothing physically looked different, but it was as if something of importance had happened. The writhing women hadn’t stopped dancing, but it was clear on the scattered faces throughout the crowd that dancing was not their number one priority anymore. They had all eyes on a man that was elegantly slicing his way through the crowd. As the air shimmered around him inconspicuously in an otherworldly haze, I now understood what Ekatarina meant by “You’ll know him when you see him”.<br/><br/>Zachary sauntered across the dance floor like a young Fabio in his prime, flashing smiles at every woman along the way. It was as if his emerald gaze were the very aphrodisiac they were craving, and the hungry gazes they shot back at him didn’t seem fit for public display. Golden tresses flowing behind, his hips seemed to move to a beat only he could hear. Rippling muscles peeked through a slit down the front of his ruffled shirt, which was tucked into painted on leather pants. Low-heeled knee-high boots completed the outfit, making him look like he’d just stepped off of a 1980s romance novel. I so did not need this right now.</p>

<p>Bard Company is the project name for a fantasy series that I started during last year's NaNoWriMo. It all started when I was trying to come up with an interesting and unusual cover for an assassin, and decided that a bard would be awesome because they can travel, get into all sorts of places, and I've always had a soft spot for bards. <br/><br/>Then I started wondering how this bard became an assassin, and suddenly my story went from being about a 20 something bard assassin, to being about a 10 year old boy. Oops. It has since morphed into a novel series about a group of eight kids as they go through a bard academy. Learning, growing, and eventually, joining the revolution. For magic has been outlawed and a church (which I'm calling the Holy Shit until I come up with a real name) has arisen that holds the continent in a stranglehold. Only their holy prophet (or maybe god?) is actually a magician that's found a way to make himself immortal (essentially), and the priesthood controls what magic is actually allowed on the continent, disguised as the work of prayer and intersession from god(?). <br/><br/>This can't be allowed to continue. <br/><br/>Last year I wrote 50,000 words of what was mainly backstory. For only one of the characters. Oops? (I say that a lot) It's been a rough year so I haven't gotten to work on the project much. As I head into this year I have a good handle on four of the main characters, sketchy ideas for two more, and two left to figure out. I plan on starting with finishing figuring out those characters, writing a little bit (hopefully) of backstory for the characters I don't know as well and, if all goes well, actually starting Bard Academy Year One. We'll see what actually happens. <br/><br/>(oh please, please, don't morph drastically again. i'm begging here guys, i'm the author and you are just the characters remember? don't give me that look! gah! really, i'm supposed to have some control of this project guys. Adair, what are you doing here, you don't even belong in my novel, you belong in Meri's!)<br/><br/>(oh dear sweet stars above, i'm going to need a lot of coffee to survive this)<br/><br/>Ahem, sorry, already-losing-my-brain author moment there. Credit for the project title goes to Duncan (Dunx). Additional goal for this project is to include as much diversity as I can, including socioeconomic, ethnic, religious, mental and physical health, and lgtbqia+. <br/><br/><br/></p>

<p>The continent of Zeria was under the thumb of a religion known as the Holy Shit*. Even Kings and Queens had to follow their edicts, and they were in charge of education in all the lands. They even had control of what songs and stories the bards were allowed to teach. The people were taught that magic was just a myth, as were any magical creatures, or magical races, that they had ever heard of. It was all a lie.</p><p>One day a boy named Rorykai, who was training to be a bard, learned the truth of what was behind The Holy Shit, and his life changed forever. He joined the underground resistance, and they saw potential in him to become an assassin and a spy. As a bard he could travel. He could gather information from the servants that were always chatty, and occasionally take out key people for the resistance. It was time to fight back, it was time to bring magic and the old gods back to the people, and Rorykai is going to do everything in his power to help make it happen.<br/><br/>*The Holy Shit is being used as a place holder until I figure out what I'm actually going to call the religion. </p>

The rage of ideas, the too-much that stole her breath and choked her into sobbing, became just one desire.<br/> I have to find him.<br/><br/><br/>""Our homeland is a graveyard,"" he said in a hoarse, gritty voice. ""The glass stands over the bodies of the dead. Leave them to their final rest, and let the living live. You want to save someone, then do it with the work of your hands. No one will die if you lose your temper over building a home. No one will die if the weaving in your clothing is imperfect. You try to pass over the work, you try to raise the dead, and I can't promise any one of us will live through it.<br/>""The dead pass on, and their children live a new life. After a fire, the prairie grows a new layer of grass. The earth will not resurrect the ashes -- the earth will honor their memory with a new generation. Give them homes, Marty. Give them trades, and beds for their children. Save them from violent death, from rape, from theft again and again. If your two hands are not enough for you, build an army.<br/>""Never touch the fire again,"" he said softly, and then Lessa saw why his head was turned away -- a tear came loose from his eye, and then another, a slow line struggling down his cheek. ""Please, for anyone you call kindred, never touch the fire again.""</p>

2035,Corvus Ptarmigan,Novel: Jihi,Genre: Science Fiction,59045,"1,968",1,"
<p>Following the life of a young hero five years after defeating the big bad. Turns out, things weren't as simple as he thought.</p>
",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/corvus-ptarmigan/novels/jihi/stats,November 2015,"
<p>            A young man sat on the deck of his blocky concrete apartment and watched people clamber in from the rain below. He blended into the wall behind him with his ashen hair and pallid complexion, a stretch of grey broken only by his purple dark circles and three vivid white scars: one stretching from the top of his left eyebrow to his cheek, one cutting through the right corner of his lips, and one carved deeply into the left side of his jaw. A shirt he'd pulled from his clothesline hung from one hand, sodden and forgotten.</p>
<p>            He often got distracted when it rained. Something about its drone on the asphalt compelled him to reconsider his life so far. Things he'd done, things he should've done.</p>
<p>            Things he shouldn't have done.</p>
<p>            The young man threw his wet shirt onto the ground and rose to his feet, intending to return to the insular cave of his apartment, when a noise stopped him through the rain's din.</p>
<p>            ""Excuse me!""</p>
<p>            It was faint. It didn't have to be for him. He continued to the sliding glass doors.</p>
<p>            ""Hey, wait!""</p>
<p>            He returned to the deck and leaned over the railing, dousing his hair in rainwater. ""What?!"" He shouted.</p>
<p>            ""Sonam?"" A voice shouted up to him. The form of his addressor was hidden by a green rain jacket. ""Vance Sonam?""</p>
<p>            He paused, then shouted, ""No. Try the next building over."" He reentered his apartment and slammed the sliding door shut behind him.</p>
<p>            With a deep breath, he attempted to calm his nerves, then retreated to a corner of the room that was barren save a square tatami mat. He sat on it facing the wall, took another breath, and eased himself into a distracted semblance of meditation.</p>
<p>            Breathe in.</p>
<p>            Breathe out.</p>
<p>            Breathe i-</p>
<p>           <em> knock knock knock.</em></p>
<p>            His eye twitched.</p>
<p>            <em>knock knock knock knock knock kno-</em></p>
<p>            He rose and marched to his front door. After taking a moment to make his expression placid, the young man opened it.</p>
<p>            He immediately recognized the green jacket from before. This time he got a better look at its inhabitant. The man was tall, and had a face that called to mind golden age generals. The young man noted that, beneath the rain coat, the man was bald.</p>
<p>            Mocking confusion, the young man tilted his head and squinted at the bald man. ""Yes? What's this about?""</p>
<p>            ""I was being polite before, I already know you're Vance Sonam. We need to talk.""</p>
<p>            ""Pretty confident. What makes you think I'm this Sonam guy?"" He countered.</p>
<p>            ""Your look isn't exactly subtle.""</p>
<p>            ""Lots of people go gray early and get into knife fights.""</p>
<p>            ""Don't play with me."" The bald man sighed, softening. ""Look, I really do need to talk to you in private. Can I come in?""</p>
<p>            Part from the rainwater flowing from his hair to his lightly clothed body, part from frustration, Vance began to shake. ""No. You can't come in. I don't know how you found me, or how you know my name, but I don't want to talk to anyone about anything, so get out of my sight before I have to get territorial."" He moved to slam the door shut.</p>
<p>            ""I'm your caseworker."" The man said.</p>
<p>            Vance halted.</p>
<p>            ""My what?""</p>

<p>“So I’ll drop you two off at the front of the hall and I’ll find parking.” Burt looked over his shoulder at John and then to Eric in the front seat. “Take the senator inside and introduce him to the local president. Got it?”</p>
<p>Eric was annoyed and fidgety, “I got it, I got it.”</p>
<p>Burt pulled up to the curb, John got out of the back seat, just before Eric could get out Burt grabs his arm. “Don’t let him out of your sight.” Eric nods and gets out of the car.</p>
<p>“Look senator I really have to use the restroom, I’ll see you inside.” Eric then sprints through the crowd of men outside the hall smoking and runs into the building.</p>
<p>John starts walking through the crowd when he is intercepted by a man holding a stack of brochures. “Would you like a brochure?” The man slyly asked.</p>
<p>John not wanting to offend the man took one. “What is this about?” he asked as he looked over the tri-fold pamphlet that was written in small print and had no graphics or pictures.</p>
<p>“Are you familiar with Right to Work?”</p>
<p>“No, I’ve never heard of it. Is this from the union?”</p>
<p>“It’s what’s best for all workers.”</p>
<p>“That sounds great, tell me about it.” He looked at the small print realizing that he might just need those reading glasses he had been avoiding getting.</p>
<p>“This will help lower union dues, it will defend the minority in bargaining and it gives workers freedom of association.” He looked at John seeing if he was buying into what he was telling him.</p>
<p>John nodded and looked at the brochure. “Well if it will help workers then I’m all for it.”</p>
<p>“By any chance, are you with the union?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m John Forlorn Democrat candidate for US Senate.”</p>
<p>“Are you speaking here tonight at the meeting?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was invited to speak to them.”</p>
<p>“Would you be willing to mention this in your speech tonight since you support it?”</p>
<p>“Yes I will. Will you vote for me?”</p>
<p>“Can’t, I’m a registered Libertarian.”</p>
<p>“You could still vote for me in November.”</p>
<p>The man smiled, “Maybe. Let’s see if you can get through the primary,” and he walked away.</p>
<p>Burt walks up behind John. “Who was that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know but he gave me some important information.”</p>
<p>“Well we need to get you inside. Where’s Eric?”</p>
<p>“He’s inside.”</p>
<p>“I told him to take you inside and introduce you.” Burt was shaking his head disapprovingly, leads John into the meeting hall.</p>
<p>After a series of handshakes and greetings a man walks up on the stage and says a few introductory items and then asks everyone to stand and say the pledge of allegiance. The secretary and treasurer gave their reports and then John was introduced.</p>
<p>John walked up on the stage. “Thank you all for inviting me to be here tonight, it is an honor. I am running for US Senate to stand up for the working man.” People applaud for a few seconds. “Just like the gentleman I met outside the meeting hall who gave me this great brochure.” John holds up the Right to Work pamphlet, a number of people in the audience gasp and start booing John. John becomes confused about why the audience has turned against him. “No, no, I was concerned at first but I was told that it will give workers more freedom, it will lower your dues and defend the minority in bargaining.” The audience is booing and now throwing garbage on the stage.</p>
<p>Burt finally finds Eric and walks over to him. “Where the hell were you?”</p>
<p>Eric laughs and waves his hand in front of his nose. “You don’t want to go where I just was” in a joking manner.</p>
<p>“Idiot, who was the State Senator talking to before he came into the building? I told you to not leave him alone.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I had to get to the bathroom quickly before-”</p>
<p>“Look at what’s going on.” Burt cut him off and points to the front of the hall. John is ducking garbage being thrown at him. “You need to get up there and get him off the stage.”</p>
<p>“No way in hell am I getting up on that stage.”</p>
<p>At this point the local president gets on the stage and starts waving his arms. “Brothers, fellow brothers please let’s calm down and act civilized. Let us explain to our brother why he is wrong about this, let us educate him on why-” A full can of soda is hurled and hits the local president on the forehead. He falls to the ground holding his head and a number of people rush the stage to check on him. The garbage has stopped being thrown on the stage but in the audience a few people are shoving each other. One man keeps yelling “I wasn’t aiming at him, I wasn’t aiming at him”, while others start to throw punches at one another.</p>
<p>Burt grabs Eric by the arm who is standing in shock watching the riot unfold in front of his eyes. “Go get the senator and leave through the exit door behind the stage, I’ll have the car ready.” Burt then runs out the door.</p>
<p>Eric makes his way to the left side of the union hall and carefully works his way up to the front where John is standing. “Senator, we need to leave now.”</p>
<p>John nods “I agree, that’s a good idea.” Eric ushers him behind the stage and they run out the exit door. Waiting outside is Burt with the car running.</p>
<p>“Get in, get in, get in already!” Burt then speeds out of the parking lot and onto the street.</p>
<p>After a minute of silence John holds up the brochure. “All I said was that this sounds like a good idea.”</p>
<p>Burt grabs the brochure from his hand, crumples it up and throws it out the car window. While looking in his rear view mirror he snaps at Eric. “Didn’t I say not to let him out of your sight? Didn’t I?” Eric sinks back into his seat with his arms folded with an angry look on his face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>June 22nd 6:30pm</p>
<p>The four candidates are standing on a stage inside a television studio. All are standing behind podiums with the Senator on the left, John next to him, Earth Rainbow next and at the end Sam Ragnaw. Behind them is a blue sign across the black curtains that says ‘This Week in Big Sky Politics’. A moderator is standing at a podium across from the candidates. There are risers in the studio with about fifty people sitting watching the debate.</p>
<p>Mark is standing on the side of the risers with a notebook taking frantic notes. Thaddius looks over Mark’s shoulder trying to see what he is writing. “How is he doing?” Mark shrugs and keeps writing.</p>
<p>Everyone on the stage is quiet, the moderator is waiting for a cue from the floor director who is holding his hand up and then starts a five second countdown and points at him. “Welcome back to This Week in Big Sky Politics. We will continue the second part of the debate of the four US Senate candidates. The next question we will start with you, Senator Wellington. There has been some recent controversy about building a highway through the Kootenai national forest connecting Highway 2 to Highway 93. Do you support building of this connector road?”</p>
<p>Senator Wellington looks at the moderator as if he is crazy. “Are you retarded?”</p>
<p>The moderator is confused. “Excuse me, sir?”</p>
<p>“Something wrong with you? Why wouldn’t you want to build a road? You should have been beaten as a child.”</p>
<p>“Sir, corporal punishment is outdated and does not work.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. I was beaten all the time by my teachers and it did me good. I still hold the fourth grade record for William Henry Harrison Elementary School for being hit at least once for forty six consecutive days. If teachers hit more students today you would have more senators and less gang members.”</p>
<p>The moderator is visibly shaken. “Um, State Senator, um, your response, please.”</p>
<p>“I want to stress again that I disagree with the Senator, corporal punishment is wrong. I have three children and I don’t hit them. Hitting children only continues the cycle of violence and it needs to end here and now.”</p>
<p>“State Senator, sorry to cut you off, but the question is about the forest road. Your opinion on that please.”</p>
<p>“Well, I think the issue of protecting our children is more important. That’s why if elected I will work to make corporal punishment against the law.”</p>
<p>“State Senator,” the moderator comments, “corporal punishment has been against the law for about eighty years now.”</p>
<p>John nods “I see, well then, that’s good to know and I still stand by it being wrong.”</p>
<p>“We’ll now hear from Mr. Rainbow.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I agree, man, hitting kids is wrong.”</p>
<p>“The question was not about children being punished it is about the new road through the forest.”</p>
<p>“Right, the road, oh yeah, um, I guess I’m cool with it as long as it doesn’t hurt any trees.”</p>
<p>“Actually, Mr. Rainbow, it will mean cutting down thousands of trees.”</p>
<p>“What! No way man! You can’t cut down a tree. They will never grow again. Trees are sacred man. They have to be saved.”</p>
<p>“And Mr. Ragnaw, your position on the forest road.”</p>
<p>Sam had been standing there fidgeting impatiently waiting to speak. “Finally. I would be opposed to this because it is part of the continuing government conspiracy. The highway system is part of a mind control plot that was orchestrated by President Eisenhower and his cabinet. Everybody knows this and as Senator I would put a stop to this and bring those who are conspiring against the American public to justice.”</p>
<p>The moderator takes a deep sigh. “We will start the next question with the ongoing trouble occurring in Bahrain. Would you support the President in sending our military to help keep the peace.”</p>
<p>Thaddius gets a panicked look on his face. “Oh no.”</p>
<p>Mark turns around. “You didn’t cover this?” he whispers to Thaddius.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t enough time” he whispers back.</p>
<p>“It’s been all over the news for the last three days. How could not think that it would be brought up?”</p>
<p>John stood frozen for a moment realizing that he had no idea about what was going on in Bahrain. “I have to say, that in this case peace is the best response. We need to protect the innocent, and make sure that we don’t risk our soldiers’ lives getting involved in a foreign nation’s internal squabbles. So I would have to look at everything before I could make a decision.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, State Senator. Mr. Rainbow?”</p>
<p>“All we are saying is give peace a chance. That was like so real back then and it’s seriously crunchy to be that way today. So I agree, man, peace is where it’s at. Those dudes need to mellow out, that’s all I’m saying man, just be mellow. Peace out.” He starts to giggle.</p>
<p>“And Mr. Ragnaw, would you support the President in this circumstance?”</p>
<p>“No way in hell. Our military is for one purpose, to defend our borders. You know how much money we give to Bahrain every year? It’s a lot and money that should be going back to the tax payers who are being robbed. Let them fix their problems, with their own money and their own military.”</p>
<p>Senator Wellington, I know you don’t often agree with the President. Is this one time you would?”</p>
<p>“No need. We should just blow them up. I learned all I need to know about those people. They’re a bunch of thieves, flying carpet riders and camel salesmen. A lousy dirty bunch of sand n-”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Senator,” the moderator quickly cuts off the Senator. “We will now go on to our next question.”</p>
<p>Mark tenses up with frustration and turns to Thaddius. “I knew he would cut him off, he’s always been biases towards the Senator.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>July 31st 12:15pm</p>
<p>Burt is sitting across from John keeping an eye on him. John is fast asleep in a blue camping chair with a peace owl balloon tied to his wrist. Burt looks around and notices the elaborate detail that the civil war reenactment group he was among. He and John looked like time travelers sitting there with men and women dressed in authentic garb from the era.</p>
<p>Eric walks up with a corn dog and a basket of curly fries. “Is he still asleep?”</p>
<p>Burt nods and looks at what Eric was eating. “Chowing down on some authentic food from that era?”</p>
<p>Eric looks at Burt confused “What?” he replies with a mouth full of fries.</p>
<p>“Never mind. Have you seen Thaddius? This was his idea and he isn’t here yet. I’ve asked like five people and no one knows who he is.” Eric shrugs. “You’d think someone would have an idea. It’s not like you could miss him.”</p>
<p>Eric swallowed the last bite of his corn dog. “Would you admit to knowing him?”</p>
<p>Burt starts to laugh. “Good point.” He looks over his shoulder and sees Thaddius coming towards them dressed in a Union soldier’s outfit and on crutches. “Here comes Mr. Popular right now.”</p>
<p>Thaddius limps up to them. “Hey guys, sorry I’m late.”</p>
<p>Burt looks impressed. “These guys think of everything. You plan out the injuries too?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, this wasn’t planned.”</p>
<p>Eric looks confused. “I didn’t think they started the battle reenactment yet?”</p>
<p>“No, they haven’t.” Thaddius gets an embarrassed look on his face. “I fell getting out of the car.” He looks over at John who is still sleeping but stirring uncomfortably. “How’s the Senator doing?”</p>
<p>“Just perfect,” Burt responds in a sarcastic tone. “We came within a few feet of an international incident in Sweet Grass last night.”</p>
<p>“He tried to cross the border?”</p>
<p>Eric wiped ketchup off his mouth. “You could say that. We chased him for almost an hour and finally tackled him in an open field a few feet from the border.”</p>
<p>“Good thing you stopped him. That would be a nightmare to try and fix. The Canadian border patrol does not have a sense of humor.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about it,” Eric muttered.</p>
<p>Burt ignored Eric. “So, is that just a sprain?”</p>
<p>Thaddius looked down at his left leg. “Yeah, I don’t think I broke it. I’ll get an x-ray when this is over.”</p>
<p>Burt looks at his watch. “When does this shindig get started?”</p>
<p>“It should be starting any moment now. They fire off a cannon and-“</p>
<p>“Did you say a cannon?” Burt cut Thaddius off mid-sentence. Thaddius, Eric and Burt all got panicked looks on their face and look at John. Burt stands up to move towards John, but he was too late, the cannon was fired.</p>
<p>John jumps up out of his seat and screeches. He looks around him and sees people dressed as soldiers. “Oh my god! The Canadians are coming for me! They are trying to arrest me for sneaking into the country! The Canadians are coming! The Canadians are coming!” Just before Burt can grab him and get him back into his chair John starts to run around shouting. He avoids everyone who is trying to grab him and he runs out into the battlefield. John runs down the middle of the field with Confederate and Union soldiers on both sides marching towards one another. “The Canadians are coming!” he repeatedly shouts as he is running by.</p>
<p>One of the Union soldiers turns to the man next to him on his right. “So that’s how the Rebs are going to win. They’re using Canadian soldiers!”</p>
<p>The other man looks at him as if he is crazy. “No, they’re not. There were no Canadian soldiers in this battle.”</p>
<p>“But that’s their secret weapon. That’s how they’re going to try and win this battle.”</p>
<p>“They did win this battle!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, because of the Canadians.”</p>
<p>“No, there weren’t any Canadians. Any way it’s supposed to be the British are coming.”</p>
<p>“So they’re using the British as well?</p>
<p>“No. And why does he have an owl balloon tied to his wrist”</p>
<p>“The balloon is their signal.”</p>
<p>“Were you asleep at the last meeting?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t make it. My daughter had soccer practice.”</p>
<p>“Well we covered the details of the Battle of Round Mountain, this is what we’re doing today.”</p>
<p>“I thought this was the Battle of Cheat Mountain?”</p>
<p>“No, that was last month. Didn’t you even open the pdf?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t have time. I was having trouble uploading my podcast. I think my carrier is limiting my bandwidth.”</p>
<p>“As if anyone would listen to that dribble.”</p>
<p>After a few hundred yards John is tackled and picked up by a group of soldiers. They start to carry him back to the sidelines. John keeps yelling. “Help me, Pierre Trudeau! Help me, Pierre Trudeau! Help me! Ich bin ein Canadian! Ich bin ein Canadian”</p>
<p>Eric, Burt and Thaddius are all watching John being carried back to the side. Thaddius is in shock. Burt looks over at Eric.  ""You know some curly fries sound good right now.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>August 28th 6:20pm</p>
<p><em>“And that’s why we need to recognize our heroes. We need to provide for them and ensure for them. Veterans are what make our country so great!”</em> John finished singing. No one was applauding, a few people were chuckling.</p>
<p>The debate moderator is very annoyed. “State Senator, I’ve asked you repeatedly to please not sing your answers. If this keeps up I will not ask you any more questions.”</p>
<p>“Aw, come on,” John pleaded back.</p>
<p>“No, I’m serious. No more singing.”</p>
<p>“All right, no more singing.”</p>
<p>“You promise?”</p>
<p>“I promise.”</p>
<p>The moderator looked at John suspiciously. “You promised before and still sang.”</p>
<p>“I swear, I won’t sing for the next question you ask. Come on, I swear and I promise.” John was smiling and shaking his arms like a child.</p>
<p>“Fine, but this is your last warning.” John nods showing that he understands. “As you may know the Henderson Mall which will have seventeen million square feet of retail space on three thousand acres. A small portion of this land is on federally protected wetlands. Should the plans be adjusted for the wetlands or should the mall move to a different location. State Senator your answer, and again I remind you not to sing your response.”</p>
<p>John nods his head in agreement. “When you build malls you run into problems like these. And I am a problem solver. I think we need to move to the next evolution of shopping and place the stores in satellites above the earth. The problem then would be what hours of operation they should have. I would introduce legislation to have all stores be open on Greenwich Mean Time, even if they are in a geosynchronous orbit. Of course, this is just a temporary fix until we move to Metric Time. Metric Time would change our current twenty four hour day with sixty minute increments to a ten hour day with one hundred and forty four minuet segments. The day would still start at midnight, which would now be hour zero. Hour one would start one hundred and forty four minutes later and so on. So for example if you normally wake up at seven in the morning to get to work by eight and leave at five, under metric time your alarm would go off at two dot ninety two, your work day would start at three dot forty two and you would clock out at seven dot zero eight. Canada will be changed over fully by January and we can learn a lot by following their lead. I should warn people who live within fifty miles of the border, you may need to purchase a new clock by the end of the year.”</p>
<p>The moderator stood silent for a moment. “Thank you for not singing, State Senator. Senator Wellington, would you adjust the plans of the mall layout or move to another location?”</p>
<p>“Am I hearing this moron correctly that we should take on the metric system like Canada? Even Canadians don’t follow the metric system. Up there football is played in yards. Doctors weigh you in pounds not grams-“</p>
<p>“Senator, the question was not about the metric system but about the Henderson mall,” the moderator interrupted to correct Senator Wellington.</p>
<p>“Oh, that thing? Just build it. So what a few frogs will die. You can’t measure that against creating more jobs and more money on the tax roll. Kids lover those places and will get them off the street. But you better have good security from those thieving filthy dirty-”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Senator,” the moderator cuts off Senator Wellington before he could finish his sentence. “I think we understand your support to build the mall. Mr. Rainbow would you rather the plans be changed or moved to a different location on the Henderson Mall.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t even build it. Why do we need another mall? To make the one percent richer by exploiting us. Will there be independent businesses selling local home made products? I don’t think so. The greedy corporations will be the only ones to benefit and they will destroy wetlands to do it. Then I say no. No to evil corporations.”</p>
<p>“And Mr. Ragnaw, how would you handle this issue?”</p>
<p>“Simple, just build the mall. Forget the wetlands. I do want to ask Earth Rainbow if he hates the evil corporations that exploit as he claims, why is he wearing Nike sneakers?”</p>
<p>Earth is caught off guard and looks at his feet. “You kidding me, man? These are the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever worn.”</p>
<p>Sam continued, “And the Kera Swansong shirt you’re wearing? You don’t have a problem wearing their corporate logo on your shirt?”</p>
<p>“Well, unlike most greedy corporations, they are one of the few who care.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Sam opens his folder full of newspaper clippings, pulls one out and holds it up. “You are aware that the Kera Swansong corporation was fined three million dollars for child labor law violations in Burma. Burma has the most lax child labor laws in the world and even they fined them. They would make four year olds work twelve hour shifts, other children are chained to their tables. And over four hundred children were blinded just in the last two months alone in their factory.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well my shirt looks cool. You’re jealous because you’re wearing a suit two sizes small that hasn’t been in style since the Franco Prussian War.”</p>
<p>The moderator jumps in at this point. “That’s enough, I want to move on to the patient people in the audience who have questions. Is the microphone ready? Good, please, will the first speaker introduce themselves and ask your question.”</p>
<p>A woman stands up with the microphone. “Hi, my name is Karen and my question is to State Senator Forlorn. I live just north of Havre and I would like to know where can I find one of these new metric clocks? Will they be sold here or do I have to go I have to go up to Canada to get one?”</p>
<p>Before John could answer the moderator responds. “There are no metric clocks.”</p>
<p>The woman responds back, “You mean that they have already sold out?”</p>
<p>“No, there is no such thing at metric time. Can the next person please take the microphone.”</p>
<p>An older woman stands up. “Yes, my name is Evelyn and I live in Cut Bank. I would like to know if I don’t buy a metric clock can I modify my existing clocks to work with metric time?”</p>
<p>The moderator is annoyed. “That will not be answered. Next question please. And, sir, please don’t ask about metric time. There is no such thing as metric time.”</p>
<p>The man holding the microphone waits for the moderator to finish speaking. “I’m not going to ask about metric time, I understand that the State Senator speaks in metaphors. My question is, is Senator Forlorn suggesting that we end our holdout as the last or one of the last countries to not accept the metric system.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir,” the moderator says, “that is a very good question. State Senator, would you care to please answer that question.”</p>
<p>“I can only answer that question if I can sing my answer.”</p>
<p>The moderator looks at John for a moment. “Well then, I guess we won’t find out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>September 10th 12:30pm</p>
<p>“Say there mister, how much do you know about fire prevention?” A young man standing behind a booth that had a Flathead County RFD sign above it was attempting to start a conversation with John. John stood motionless, confused and nervous. “Do you know about the fire triangle?”</p>
<p>John though for a moment. “I think I do. Is it one of the nine ways to enter the vortex of damnation without making a long distance call?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Its fuel, oxygen and heat.” A young boy walks up to the booth. “Say there little man, would you like to spin our wheel of fire to win a prize?”</p>
<p>The boy’s eyes lit up with excitement. He reached up to grab the prize wheel to spin but John reaches out and grabs the small boy’s hand before he could spin. “Don’t spin the wheel. If you do it will cause a million souls to burn to death as they travel the transcontinental dimensional portal bridge.”</p>
<p>The boy looks up at John and as soon as he lets go of the boy’s hand he spins the wheel as hard as he can. It spins around and John looks at the wheel with terror. The wheel lands on helmet. “Oh boy, a helmet!” the boy squeals with excitement.</p>
<p>The man in the booth grabs a red plastic fire helmet. “You’ll win this helmet if you can tell me what to do if you are on fire?”</p>
<p>“Stop, drop and roll!” the boy yells out.</p>
<p>“That’s right, stop, drop and roll.” He hands the helmet to the boy who puts it on his head and runs off excited. The man looks at John. “Would you like to spin the wheel of fire for a prize mister?”</p>
<p>John starts muttering “Dear god no, protect me from the evil-“. He is interrupted when he backs into a man dressed in a giant huckleberry costume. The costume consisted of a large purple round suit with a hat that looked like a stem. His face was painted purple and was wearing a purple long sleeve shirt with purple gloves and pants, although none of them were the same shade of purple. His sneakers were painted purple but not very well since some white was showing in a few places.</p>
<p>The giant huckleberry turned around. “Hey, buddy watch where you’re going.”</p>
<p>John was now more panicked than at the wheel of fire. “How did you make it to this dimension? I killed you at the coffee shop next to the gateway of the eighty third dimension three weeks ago. You’re here for revenge aren’t you?”</p>
<p>The huckleberry looked at John confused. “What in the world are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“You don’t fool me for a minute. I bet you have a clarinet with you, don’t you? Don’t you!” John was getting frantic and was now yelling.</p>
<p>Burt was on line at the beer tent having his beer handed to him when he heard John yelling. He looked behind him to Eric. “Go check on the State Senator.”</p>
<p>Eric is annoyed “You’re not the boss of me. Why don’t you go?”</p>
<p>“Because I have a beer in my hand and I can’t leave the area. You haven’t got a beer yet.”</p>
<p>“I’ll hold your beer.”</p>
<p>Burt was annoyed. “Fine.” He hands the beer to Eric. “You better not drink from it.”</p>
<p>Eric smiles “I promise, you can trust me.”</p>
<p>Burt looks at him with suspicion and leans over his beer and spits into it. “A bit of insurance on your trust.” Eric looks at the beer debating if he should take a sip or not as Burt leaves the beer tent. He finds John almost at blows with the huckleberry mascot.</p>
<p>“You want me to tell everyone that you are carrying a clarinet? I have no fear of you. I’ll shout it and then we’ll see who will protect you then.”</p>
<p>“Buddy, if you poke my costume one more time I will cut your face.”</p>
<p>Burt races over and starts to lead John away and looks at the mascot. “No need to make an issue all right? He apologized so get over it.”</p>
<p>“He never apologized” the giant huckleberry retorted.</p>
<p>“Deal with it,” Burt shot back.</p>
<p>The huckleberry shook his head “Crazy freak.”</p>
<p>A young man comes running up to Burt and John. “I’m sorry sir, he got away from me. I need to get him over to the alpaca milking contest, it’s about ready to start.”</p>
<p>Burt hands John over to him. “Don’t let him out of your site.” The young man nods and leads John away. John is looking over his shoulder at the huckleberry mascot who is high fiving with young children and letting them take selfies with him.</p>
<p>“Sir, everything will be all right.” It wasn’t clear if the young man was trying to reassure John or himself.</p>
<p>John looked at the young man. “What is your name?”</p>
<p>“Dale, sir. My name is Dale.”</p>
<p>“Dale, I don’t think I can participate in this contest. My socks are on the wrong feet and it may cause me too much pain.”</p>
<p>“Nothing to worry about sir, you’ll be sitting during the event.” John attempted to break away, but Dale grabbed hold of John’s arm before he could break away. “Sir, you will not be running away again as long I am responsible for you.” Dale spoke in an authoritative way that scared John into complying.</p>
<p>They arrive at the contest area and see that there are five stools facing five alpacas who are all in a closed off space. The emcee comes forward to shake John’s hand. “State Senator, so glad that you can make it. Let’s get you a bucket.” John gives him a leery look and then shakes his hand. “Come this way” he lead John into the pen with the other contestants.</p>
<p>Eric walks up to Dale. “Good, you got him here in one piece.”</p>
<p>Dale turned to look at Eric. “It wasn’t easy.” He watches as John is handed a bucket and walked over to a stool in front of an alpaca. “Why are they using alpacas to try and milk? I have an uncle in California who runs an alpaca farm and once spent the summer there when I was a teenager. They are very difficult to milk.”</p>
<p>“That’s because they used to use goats, but there was a controversy a few years ago. Somehow a male goat was brought in and the state representative who got the goat made a big deal about it. She claimed that it was sexual harassment, the goat farmer got in her face and threatened her. It turned into a big ugly mess. She ended up losing re-election and he was banned from the festival.”</p>
<p>Burt walks up to the two of them. “I was looking for you. Where is my beer?”</p>
<p>“I drank it.”</p>
<p>“Even after I spit in it?”</p>
<p>Eric shrugs. “Alcohol kills germs.” Burt walks away shaking his head in disbelief.</p>
<p>The emcee grabs a microphone and stands in the middle of the pen. “Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the annual Flathead County Huckleberry Festival milking contest.” The crowd applauds. “Our contestants this year are County Commissioner Bill Flogmager, State Representative James Marbaspin, State Representative Kalley Ripkount, County Commissioner William Litwatiching, and State Senator John Forlorn.” All the elected officials wave to the crowd except for John who is looking into his empty bucket with despair. “And as special judge, I present to you Mrs. Sour Cream 1989, Betty Hardfrog.” Betty walks over to the emcee and waves to the audience.</p>
<p>John sits at his stool and an alpaca is brought next to him. It turns to look at John. He stares at it in the eyes. “Are you a friendly land monster?”</p>
<p>“Okay folks, the rules are simple. You have three minutes to get the most milk. Good luck everyone. And start milking!”</p>
<p>The other contestants start to milk their animals, John is at a loss.  “Does the State Senator know how to milk an alpaca?” Dale asks Eric.</p>
<p>“I doubt it. How hard can it be?”</p>
<p>“Pretty hard if you don’t know what you’re doing.” Dale watches John struggle. “He better be careful the way he is sitting because alpacas have a tendency to kick.”</p>
<p>“But they are rather docile creatures, aren’t they?” Eric was beginning to get worried.</p>
<p>John finally puts his hands on the alpaca to attempt to milk it and it starts to make a high pitch bray. The alpaca swings it’s right hind leg and kicks John, knocking him off his stool. A wave of laughter comes from the audience, but John doesn’t notice it. He jumps up and punches the alpaca in the ribs. This gets the animal angry and it bites him on his forearm. John puts his hands around its neck and starts to strangle it.</p>
<p>A farmer comes running into the pen. “Don’t you hurt my Betsy!” He runs over to John and pulls his hands off the alpaca. The animal falls to the ground. “I’m going to kill you!” He starts to swing wildly at John but loses his balance and falls to the ground. John picks up his bucket to use as a weapon and pulls it behind his back to hit the farmer with it.</p>
<p>Just before John is able to connect with the bucket the huckleberry mascot runs into the pen and grabs John’s arm. John turns and looks at the huckleberry mascot. “You again! This time I will make sure you’re dead before I leave this dimension.”</p>
<p>The mascot pulls a knife out and waves it in front of John. “Let’s see you try it, freak.”</p>
<p>“Where was he hiding a knife?” Eric asks out loud but no one pays attention to him.</p>
<p>Just as the mascot is to lunge at John, Burt comes running in and shoves the mascot away. The mascot falls down and because of his costume is stuck on his back like a turtle. He attempts to roll over to get up but John runs over and starts to beat him with the bucket. Burt quickly drags John away who throws the bucket at the huckleberry mascot but misses. The farmer is holding his dead alpaca crying and the mascot keeps rolling around trying to stand up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>September 29th 6:25pm</p>
<p>“And we will now hear from State Senator Forlorn, his view on fracking.” The moderator spoke in a tone that was disappointed and mocking.</p>
<p>John was drawing with a bunch of crayons at his podium and looks up at the moderator. “Thanks, just give me a second here” John finishes coloring his picture, “Okay I’m ready. Oh wait, first I want to show you what I was talking about from the last question since I didn’t have time to finish coloring what I was saying since I spoke first.” John holds up his picture. “This is the Federal Reserve on fire and you see the fire falling from the sky as well, but the fire falling is much hotter so it looks blue. The money is burning as it flies from the windows of the building as you can see here.”</p>
<p>Sam, who is standing to the right of John, eyes light up when he sees the picture. “State Senator, do you mind if I have that picture?”</p>
<p>John turns to Sam and hands the picture over to him. “Here you go, good sir, please enjoy.” Sam holds the picture up and beams with a big smile looking at it. John holds up another picture. “So here is what fracking will do. Under the ground the fire is created and will shoot up from different wells at different points in the ground. The process does create many different universes, but since they are all underground, many will leave the dimension and set up shop elsewhere. The rest will find their way through the dimensional gateway which is available to them by the fires created by the great space sloth. The red dots show this on the picture.” John picks up another picture. “This here is the fire that will come from the ground that can be used to purify our blenders, sponges and light bulbs. With this fire we can trade it and watch it burn.” John puts the picture down and appears to get serious. “Now it has been said that Zargov the evil demon of Gaaaaar may want to exploit the use of fire from fracking since he is the demon protector of toaster ovens and helium balloons, but I don’t think it’s fair to call him evil. I personally think that this is a genetic disorder and the evilness is not by choice.”</p>
<p>The moderator stands silent looking very concerned. “Um, all right then, I’ll move on to the next question. Senator Wellington, do you support the use of unmanned drone strikes on American citizens on US soil?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Anything to keep those pinkos from rising up again. I don’t know how they use that stuff with electric mail and the Interweb thing, but they know how to find those trouble makers and blow them to bits.”</p>
<p>The moderator follows up “Even on American soil Senator?”</p>
<p>Senator Wellington looks at the moderator is he is crazy. “Why not. A commie is a commie and where ever they are, they need to be killed.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Ragnaw, do you support the government using unmanned drone strikes on American citizens on US soil?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. In fact these drones are being used for other invasions of privacy. They are being flown to spy on us, keeping tabs of what we are eating, how many machine guns we own and who we talk to. The drone program was a farce, they claimed it was created to protect our military in wartime situations. The real reason is to collect data on American citizens so that they know how to personally enslave all of us. And without us even knowing about it.” Sam opens his folder and fishes through it and pulls out a paper. “This was found on the web about how they are now developing drones that will jam our theta waves while we are sleeping and use it for mind control. And I quote ‘Research is being done in Area 51 where-”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Ragnaw, but your time is up,” the moderator interrupts Sam. Sam looks down at his watch confused believing that he was cheated on his time. “And now,” a deep sigh from the moderator “Senator Forlorn.”</p>
<p>John looks up smiling. “I’m ready this time.” He holds up another drawing. “As you can see here the man on fire is Bill and he is going to enter into the 7-11 which is burning as well and is inside of a tar pit. Now the drone that has entered from the wormhole in the sky is only starting to catch on fire which is why I used my orange crayon to show the flames.”</p>
<p>Mark is standing in the back of the auditorium and looks over at a man frantically writing notes in a notepad. He walks over to look at what he is writing but he stops and looks at Mark, first with a paranoid look and then melts into a relaxed smile. “I know you, you work on the State Senator’s campaign.”</p>
<p>Mark looks at him closely. “Yes, I do. I recognize you too. I’ve seen you at other events, you’re a reporter. With the Post Times?”</p>
<p>“The Herald. Eric Bantgauverton with the Herald.” He reaches into his pocket and hands Mark a business card.</p>
<p>Mark looks at the card and nods. “I’ve read a number of your articles you’ve written about the campaign. Thanks for being so supportive of the State Senator.”</p>
<p>“No problem. Anything to keep that jerk from winning again.”</p>
<p>“I take it you don’t like him?”</p>
<p>“No. But I hate his campaign manager worse. Two months ago that fascist beat me with a car antenna at an event.”</p>
<p>“Sorry to hear that.” Mark was now feeling uncomfortable talking with Eric and was wondering how he could gracefully exit this conversation.</p>
<p>“You are so lucky to work with the State Senator. The man is a modern day political poet. His metaphors about fire have been on target all night.”</p>
<p>“They have?” Mark didn’t realize he responded so unconvincingly.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. Talking about the Federal Reserve on fire, everyone knows that they are in big trouble. And fracking, the danger of it exploding. And now what he is saying about the drones, just pure genius.”</p>
<p>John points to his picture. “Now there are two things that are wrong in this picture that I’m sure some of you may have noticed. The first is that it isn’t drawn to scale. I apologize for that since I am under the gun trying to draw these fires. And secondly since the government is testing wormholes in Detroit, as well as New Mexico but that hasn’t been confirmed yet. And from looking closely at this picture you can tell Bill isn’t in Detroit but in Albany New York. Again I apologize for these mistakes.”</p>
<p>Eric is writing proudly writing frantically. “Pure genius I tell you, pure genius.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, pure genius” Mark causally comments and looks to the ground feeling dejected.</p>

<p>October 31st 8:55am</p>
<p>Dave walked out of his regular coffee shop sipping his favorite drink and walks towards his car. A municipal bus goes down the street. Dave looks up and sees on the side ‘Vote Forlorn on the Ides of Undecember’ and gets a nauseous feeling in the pit of his stomach. As he is driving to the office, at a red light he looks up and sees a billboard with the same black lettering on a white background.</p>
<p>He races to the office and walks in to see John in the conference room with the rest of the staff. He walks in without John noticing. “So this new ad campaign will not only win the election, but once and for all allow people to stop living the lie that our calendars are telling us.”</p>
<p>Dave sits down and asks calmly, “What is going on? Why are there signs out there saying Vote for Forlorn on the Ides of Undecember?”</p>
<p>No one speaks. Thaddius breaks the silence. “The State Senator is telling us about the great conspiracy that Big Calendar is propagating against society.”</p>
<p>“And what conspiracy is that?”</p>
<p>John turns to Dave. “It’s the conspiracy that we have been told that November is the eleventh month when it is really the ninth month. November does not mean eleventh month, it means ninth month.”</p>
<p>Dave looks confused. “Who cares?”</p>
<p>John is shocked. “We are telling voters to vote in the wrong month. They need to be voting in Undecember.”</p>
<p>“But why on the ides of the month?” Thaddius asks.</p>
<p>“That’s because ides is Latin for election day.”</p>
<p>“No it’s not. It’s Latin for middle of the month.”</p>
<p>John looks confused. “Isn’t that the day of the election?”</p>
<p>Thaddius shakes his head no. “The ides would be a week later on the fifteenth. Election day is November eighth.”</p>
<p>“I can deal with him not understanding this,” Dave comments, “but what concerns me is that the signs say to vote in Non-December-”</p>
<p>“Undecember,” John interrupts to correct Dave.</p>
<p>“Whatever. I want to know who paid for this ad campaign.” Dave turns to look at Barbara.</p>
<p>“My job is to raise money and write checks,” Barbara causally responds.</p>
<p>“But why did you cut him a check?” Dave asks her.</p>
<p>“Because he had an invoice.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have given him a check.”</p>
<p>“He creeps me out and I didn’t want to get into a fight with him. Anyway, it’s not my job to look after him. I’ve worked on dozens of campaigns. If the candidate comes to you and asks for a check, you write it out.”</p>
<p>Dave is not getting angrier by the minute. “How much was the amount?”</p>
<p>“It was for seventy thousand.” Dave gets a look of shock on his face.</p>
<p>John tries to explain. “It’s for a for a statewide campaign and it’s a good rate.”</p>
<p>Dave looks at John. “Not only did you tell people to vote in a month that doesn’t exist, you tell them to go and vote on the wrong day. And you don’t even mention what you are running for!” He turns towards Barbara and points his finger at her. “You don’t give John another check.”</p>
<p>Barbara looks back at Dave with steely eyes. “You’re right because I quit.” She stands up. “You have the right to sign checks. Everything is in my office. Good luck.” She walks out of the office.</p>
<p>Dave puts his face in his hands. “How could this have happened” he laments.</p>
<p>“What do you expect after what we’ve been doing to him the past few months?” Mark replies.</p>
<p>Dave takes his hands away from his face. “Watch your mouth.”</p>
<p>“You know what, at this point it doesn’t matter. The State Senator has no idea of anything anymore, his brain has been melted.” He looks at John. “Senator, when is the election?”</p>
<p>John thinks for a moment. “Isn’t it in a few months? Or was it last week?”</p>
<p>“I think I’ve proved my point.”</p>
<p>“What point?” Dave fires back. “You didn’t prove anything.” Mark shakes his head no, gets up and walks out of the conference room. Dave is clearly furious at this point. He looks at Eric. “You need to get this canceled.”</p>
<p>Eric chuckles. “That’s the job of a political director, not a scheduler. If I remember correctly during our first staff meeting, you said that Mark is the political director and that I was the campaign scheduler and that’s that. So, I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Dave quickly flings his coffee cup at Eric hitting him on his shoulder and causing coffee to splash all over Eric. Eric jumps up out of his seat. “You son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>Burt quickly grabs his arm and pulls him back into his seat. He leans in and whispers to Eric. “Let it go, this isn’t the time or place.” Eric was struggling to jump back up. “Trust me, don’t react and it will give you the upper hand.”</p>
<p>Dave didn’t notice Burt talking to Eric since he was lighting a cigarette. When he looks up he sees that Eric is staring him down with a death glare that freaks Dave out. Burt was right in his assessment and it gave Eric the upper hand. Ethan had finally looked up from his phone confused as to what is going on. John had already crawled under the table.</p>
<p>Thaddius looks around the room and is surprised that no one has said anything to Dave yet. “You know I think it is against workplace regulations to smoke indoors.”</p>
<p>Dave looks at Thaddius. “You know what? Why don’t you shut the f-”</p>
<p>“All right Dave, enough already,” Burt interrupts Dave. “You need to chill out and stop taking it out on everyone in the room.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need advice from a three time loser.” Burt just stares at Dave not saying anything. Dave gets up and storms out of the conference room.</p>

<p><br/>""So here's the equipment room, the box is over there."" The customer led John into a cramped closet that would have trouble fitting a few coats into. ""Think you can fix it?""<br/><br/>""How long has it been out of service?"" John asked.<br/><br/>""I don't know, about a week I guess?""<br/><br/>John grabbed a screwdriver and open up the device. He looked down into it and couldn't believe his eyes. He stared for a few seconds that felt like hours in his mind. ""Well sir, I think I've found your problem. You may want to come over here and see this for yourself.""<br/><br/>The customer looked into the opened device. ""Is that what I think it is?""<br/><br/>""Yes sir"", John said calmly ""Your device is full of eels."" Inside the device was about twelve small eels wriggling around. ""My guess is that this is causing the device not to work. They must have chewed through the power supply and looks like most of the circuit boards as well.""<br/><br/>""Well I didn't do it"" the customer responsed defensively.""<br/><br/>""Sir, I know you had nothing to do with this.""<br/><br/>""How did they get in there?""<br/><br/>John shrugged. ""I don't know. I have another unit in my van, I will go get it and replace this one.""<br/><br/>""What's going to happen to the eels""?<br/><br/>""I don''t know. Guess I'll get rid of them for you.""<br/><br/>""Do they belong to Jenkins Electrical?""<br/><br/>""What?""<br/><br/>""Do they belong to your company? They were inside the equipment.""<br/><br/>John thought for a moment. ""No sir, they don't belong to Jenkins Electrical.""<br/><br/>""So then I can have them?""<br/><br/>John was confused. For a moment he started to think that he was having a dream, that it was still last night and he finally fell asleep. That though faded quickly as John realized that this is not as strange as his dreams so it must be happening. <br/><br/>""Yes sir, you can have them if you want.""<br/><br/>The customer's face lighted up like a kid in a candy store and he reached in and grabbed the eels. John turned away and walked out of the customer site and down the sidewalk to his van. He realized that he was parked on a hill and he was going to have carry the device back up the hill, something he was not looking forward to. John opened the side door of his van and it slammed shut as soon as he let go of the door. He realized that he was going to have to prop the door open. He grabbed a screwdriver and wedged it in the side of the door and climbed inside the back of his van. He looked for a replacement device and found one burried under a bunch of other boxes. As he was pulling them off John accidently bumped the screwdriver and the door slammed shut.<br/><br/>""Great"", John sighed. As he pulled the lever to open the door again it wouldn't open. He pulled hard and it didn't budge. John wasn't claustrophobic but the last place he wanted to be was trapped inside a van. He kept thinking to himself why is this door locked? Why is it not opening? What am I doing wrong? John took a breath to calm down and think logically. He realized that there had to be a simple solution to this problem. At that moment he looked at the side window and saw the disclaimer for child proof locks.<br/><br/>He said out loud ""Why would you put child proof locks on a work vehicle? Who would be so stupid as to set the child proof --"" John stopped himself and realized who set the child proof lock. ""I am going to kill William when I get back to the office.""<br/><br/>Over the past two years John and William would play pranks on one another. The first one John remembered is he asked William to get something from his van and gave him the keys. The next time John started the vehicle he found out that William turned on the heat to full blast, radio was full volume on static, windshield wippers going, turn blinkers, pretty much everything that could be turned on was done.<br/><br/>To get him back John got William''s phone and set the language to Portuguese. William then removed John's email account off the server. John put bubble wrap under William's tires. William filled a box of confetti over John's desk that John accidently triggered when he reached up for a manual. But there was one that stood above them all, the Sargent Pepper's of all pranks.<br/><br/>William made up a crude sign that he left on his desk with the initials STFU, the abbreviation for shut the f*** up. He would hold it up when he didn't want any one to bother him. One day John printed out I''m Gay and taped it over the front of the sign and placed it back face down the way William would always keep it. About two months ago Tim was trying to get everyone in the office to come to the conference room for a meeting. William wouldn't move from his desk. Tim was standing with the entire office looking at William as he held up the sign without looking at it first. There was incrediable laughter from everyone. William was annoyed and demanded to know who messed with his sign. When John finally caught his breath he told him that he had been waiting for over three months for him to pick up that sign.<br/><br/>John knew it was only a matter of time before William got him back. John realized that if you live by the sword you die by the sword. It had been almost six months since that prank John thought, so who knows how long William had this time bomb prank been there he realized. John wasn't angry, just agravated that on a day when he got pratically no sleep this was the day he would face this prank.<br/><br/>John realized that in order to get out of the van someone would have to open the door for him. He didn't want to call William, that would be admitting defeat. Nor could he let anyone else in the office know because it would get back to William. If he could get the door to be opened, he could fix the child proof lock and no one would know that he got caught.<br/><br/>John looked out the window to see if anyone was on the street that he could signal over to let him out. There were people walking past him but no one noticed him. John started to bang on the window and signal to come towards the van. Finally one man wearing a brown hat stopped but just stood there looking at John.<br/><br/>John shouted ""Please open the door"" but it was muffled. The man stood there like he was watching a television in a store window. A few more people started to gather around and watch John. John became more animated and started tapping the window and make the motion of opening the door.<br/><br/>A woman in the crowd asked out loud ""What is he doing?""<br/><br/>The man in the brown hat said ""I think he's some sort of street performer.""<br/><br/>Another man observing wearing a green coat chimed in. ""He's not very good. What is he trying to do?""<br/><br/>A woman watching with her child also joined the conversation ""I think he's one of those people who act out things that are not there, like walking in the wind and stuff.""<br/><br/>""A clown"" the man in the green coat responded.<br/><br/>""No"" said the man in the brown hat, ""You mean a mime.""<br/><br/>The first woman responded ""I though mimes were silent. I think I heard him just say something.""<br/><br/>John shouted ""Yes, please let me out."" Again it was muffled so the crowd didn't understand what he said.<br/><br/>""You see"" the woman now pointing at John ""he spoke. That's not a mime.""<br/><br/>""Or a really bad one"" the man in the green coat added.<br/><br/>""Hey, you remember that classic movie about mimes?"" the man in the brown hat asked the crowd.<br/><br/>John shouted from inside the van ""You're talking about Children of Paradise.<br/><br/>""The man in the brown hat looked at John ""What?""<br/><br/>John looked around and found a notepad, wrote Children of Paradise on the page and held it up to the window. The man in the brown hat shook his head ""No, that's not it""<br/><br/>The man in the green coat eyes light up ""I know, you mean It.""<br/><br/>""Yes, exactly. Thank you, it was It."" The man in the brown hat happly replied.<br/><br/>John banged on the window and wrote on another page on the notepad that It was about a clown and held it up to the window. Everyone in the crowd was disappointed. The woman with the child spoke up ""Oh I know, Killer Klowns From Outer Space.""<br/><br/>John smacked his forehead in frustration and quickly wrote on the notepad that it has clowns in the title so it can't be a movie about mimes and held it up to the window. A few people in the crowd responded with agreement.<br/><br/>The man in the brown hat spoke again. ""Ether way I don't like mimes, they support the metric system."" A few gasps came from the crowd. ""It's true. I've seen them publicly annouce it.""<br/><br/>""If they're mimes, how did they announce it? They can't speak?"" The woman repsonded.<br/><br/>John banged on the glass and held up the notepad saying that a mute can't speak, mimes perform without speaking. The man in the brown hat added his agreement ""The mime is right, they can speak, or at least yell if you punch them. No the mime didn't tell me, it was on a flyer talking about it and how they plan to protest the anti metric system rally next week.""<br/><br/>John banged on the window again and wrote I am not a mime.<br/><br/>""He says he's not a mime"" replied the man in the brown hat, ""but I still don't like them. How can they support the metric system?"" A wave of agreement came from the crowd.<br/><br/>The woman proudly announced ""See I knew he wasn't a mime, he was talking during his act.""<br/><br/>John was getting stressed and agrivated. He was thinking his best bet would have been to sit in the back and wait for a junkie to break into the van and steal his copper wire.. At least then he could make an escape. He smacked his forehead again and realized what an idiot he is. He wrote on the notepad and held it up to the window saying please let me out I am locked inside the van - child proof lock is set.<br/><br/>The woman said ""I see he's making a political statement. He's saying he is trapped by society, in this case his van, and he wants to break out of his shell and become his own man by joining the crowd.""<br/><br/>The crowd watching this was now at least thirty people. An much older man pipped up ""How can he become an individual by joining the crowd. Isn't he more of an individual by staying locked inside his van?""<br/><br/>The woman responded ""I see your point, but maybe there is much more complex reason why he is trapped inside the van. Maybe it's something more to it than just being locked inside of a van.""<br/><br/>John yelled ""No, I'm locked in please let me out."" Again his yelling was muffled and no one understood him.<br/><br/>""Well I'll give him credit for his originality"" said the man with the brown hat ""he's not that bad as astreet performer. And he looks like someone who also hates mimes."" At that moment he pulled a coin from his pocket and tossed it at the window of the van. Additional people started to throw coins at John. John started to bang his head repeatly on the window out of frustration, which drew great applause from the crowd. Just when he though it couldn't get worse he noticed that his supervisor Tim was in the crowd watching this. John quickly moved to the back of the van hoping that he didn't see him.<br/><br/>""Where did he go?"" the woman with the child asked.<br/><br/>""He must be getting ready for the next show"" repsonded the old man.</p>

<p>Fenna scowled through the mirror at the people driving behind her. She'd thought before that she was being followed. Now she was certain of it. She recognized the car, and more to the point she recognized the person driving it. There couldn't be that many people his (her?) age with white hair. The person next to them looked familiar also. He was darker than his companion. Both wore black suits, and black sunglasses. In the back seat she could see a birdcage.</p>
<p>Yes, she was sure it was them. She shook her head. Black suits, black sunglasses. Was she being followed by the Men In Black or something? She thought that was just a movie! Maybe it was real. She obviously wasn't the only human to have been abducted by an alien, since she had actually met other humans up in space, but seriously? Could they be more stereo typically spooky government agent?</p>
<p>“What's wrong?” Sobric asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing, it's just...” She fumed silently for several minutes. She should probably tell him. She should definitely tell him. “We're being followed.”</p>
<p>“Is... is that bad?” He asked, sounding uncertain.</p>
<p>She scoffed. “<em>Obviously.</em> Especially since we seem to be being followed by the Men In Black, or some shit.”</p>
<p>“The who?”</p>
<p>“Haven't I had you watch that movie yet?” She shook her head. “According to the movies and the stories, secret government agents that monitor aliens and do... I don't even know. Things. And keep the existence of aliens a secret, generally.”</p>
<p>“So humans <em>know</em> there are other sentient creatures who are kidnapping them? Why aren't you-”</p>
<p>“Not know.” She said, cutting him off. “It's... a lot of people don't think aliens exist. Or if they do think they exist they think they have nothing to do with earth and humans. They think there's no way that aliens could possibly have a higher level of technology. Which is crap. I mean, your planet is how much older than mine?”</p>
<p>“Approximately-”</p>
<p>“That was a rhetorical question. My point is, most humans don't really think aliens interact with humans. Some do. Other humans think these people are nuts.”</p>
<p>“Do... you?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I did, before. I thought aliens probably existed, but not here, anywhere. Now, well.”</p>
<p>He gave a short laugh. “Glad to know I've changed your mind about something, anyway.”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “You've changed my mind about a lot of things, dummy.” She glanced in the rear view mirror again. “But, back to the pertinent subject... What do we do about our stalkers back there?”</p>

<p>It was so weird, all those years later, to realize how fortunate I was at the moment of my doom.<br/>It took me a moment to realize what was happening. I'd been at work, no, I'd been home, it was... what day was it? Something important. Where was I now? Red earth crumbled under my hands as I tried to sit up. It was wet somehow, but not with water... with blood. With my blood, I could see it pooling under me, soaking the ground. What was wrong with me? Why was I bleeding?<br/>My husband, Sean, was next to me. “Sean?” I croaked, my blood soaked hands reaching out for him. He was bleeding too. There was so much blood. He had deep gouges in his chest, like something with huge, terrible claws had grabbed and dropped him suddenly. I could see I had similar gouges. We were bleeding to death, but why? I looked around us. Help. We needed help. But everyone I could see was just as bad as we were, and... Was I hallucinating?<br/>“Faye? 'Er you an angel? 'M I dyin'?” Sean slurred at me. Great, he was delusional. Just what I needed.<br/>I shook him a bit. It hurt to move. “Sean, you gotta stay awake. You're bleeding.” I looked around again, still confused. There were people with wings, and fur, and horns. Did we get dropped into the middle of some kind of cos play thing in the desert? Why couldn't I remember anything? My head started to spin. I was losing too much blood.<br/>“You're bleeding, too.” Sean said. “Why d'you have wings, Faye?” I froze. Now that he mentioned it, it did feel like I had wing-like appendages... Some one screaming distracted me. I looked up for the source, and suddenly realized how dire our situation was.<br/>We were lying in some kind of trench, or valley, with hundreds of other people. Everyone was bleeding from those deep, ugly gouges that Sean and I had. Like me, most people... didn't look quite human anymore. A lot of them had random appendages tacked on. Some of them had grown fur too. One guy had large, rocky looking spikes poking out of the back of his shirt. Not all of the blood was red, either.<br/>I heard the screaming again, and looked around for it. It sounded like a child. Everyone was laying down in their own personal puddle of blood, so I could see down to the opening of the little valley, where there was a tiny, blood soaked figure, standing and screaming. Small wings protruded from their back, and I could see their hands starting to glow with an eery green light. I could see the wounds on those closest to them beginning to close.<br/>The child screamed again, louder, and the glowing around their hands got brighter. Suddenly everything began to hurt. I bit back a whimper and looked down in time to watch a three inch gash on my arm knit itself closed without leaving so much as a scar. The pain ebbed, and faded. I was exhausted, and still covered in my own blood, but I didn't seem to be hurt anymore. I sat up wobbly and looked around to see everyone else doing the same thing. I couldn't see the kid anymore.<br/>“Where are we?” Someone asked. “What happened?” I looked over at my husband and we shared bewildered looks.<br/>Yeah. What had happened?</p>

<p>With the usual neighbors eliminated, that only left her one option. To call the cupcake shop and hope that the three demon hunters were still at work. She knew Oliver, Jack, and Will had rented a house nearby to stay for the duration of their undercover mission, but she hadn’t bothered getting their number before, simply because she had just assumed that they would take care of whatever that needed to be taken care of. But she also knew that if they were working now, they wouldn’t be able to sense whatever it was that was trying to get into Z Street despite the protective spells.</p>
<p>Madame Snake sighed and dialed the cupcake shop.</p>
<p>“Mr. Gillycuddy’s Cupcake Shoppe,” said a familiar male voice on the other end. “How may I help you?”</p>
<p>“It’s your neighbor.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Madame Snake,” exclaimed Bjorn. “Is it about the cupcake? I didn’t think it would work so fast…”</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t about the cupcake. I haven’t eaten either of them yet. But something’s telling me that there’s something bad happening at the entrance to Z Street. I think it might be what Oliver, Jack, and Will are looking for, although I’m not one hundred percent sure.”</p>
<p>“They left about ten minutes after you left the shop,” he told her. “They had gotten a tip from one of their contacts that there was something that they needed to check out in Kearny Mesa. So if they were to come back straight away, it would be half an hour at the very least.”</p>
<p>“Damn. I’m not sure this could wait half an hour.”</p>
<p>“I’ll text them to see if they’re still busy or if they’re already on their way back.” There was a pause on the other end as Bjorn typed the message into his cell phone. On the other end, she heard a faint beep, indicating that one of the demon hunters had responded to his message. “Nope. It looks like they’re busy with something big in Kearny Mesa. We’re going to have to deal with it ourselves.”</p>
<p>“We?”</p>
<p>“Well, it is a weekday and business is slow tonight. I can close early and no one will be the wiser.”</p>
<p>“What about your new employee, Hank?”</p>
<p>“He left soon after the others. I didn’t really need any extra hands to man the dead hours. Besides, Hank is busy moving into his new apartment on E Street. Apparently he got a pretty good deal with the landlord.”</p>
<p>“You mean he enchanted the landlord into giving him a good deal,” said Madame Snake. “But never mind that. I didn’t even know unicorns needed an apartment.”</p>
<p>“Well, finding a barn stall in the city is next to impossible.”</p>
<p>Madame Snake shook her head in exasperation even though she knew that Bjorn couldn’t see her. “Fine. Other than cooking, do you know how to deal with dangerous entities that might have the power to be able to break spells that are strong enough to protect an entire neighborhood?”</p>
<p>“There’s a high likelihood that I do not possess those powers,” he told her, “but I’m sure I could help, even if it’s just to provide a distraction so you can run away.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to run like a coward and leave other people to get killed on my behalf!”</p>
<p>“Aw, I didn’t know that you cared that much about me,” he said amused. “Well, it wouldn’t take me that much time to close up shop. I’ll meet you at your front door in five minutes.”</p>
<p>When he hung up, Madame Snake immediately went to her tiny workroom on the second floor where she kept certain pieces of equipment in case of an emergency. One was a tiny bronze dagger which upon first examination, appeared to be a flimsy weapon that would bend and break upon contact with anything substantial. However, there was a subtle spell overlaid on top of it that made the blade more than what it seemed. She also retrieved a slim black box from a drawer in her desk. It was the size of an eyeglass case, but there was a tiny silver lock on the side that had a special spell on it that would prevent any casual user from accidentally opening it. She slipped the box into a pocket and then headed out of her apartment and shop.</p>
<p>Bjorn waited a few feet outside, looking at the phone in his hand. Just as she was locking up, he typed something into the phone and remarked, “Oliver sent me another text message just now. He said that he and the others wouldn’t be back until much later tonight. Apparently whatever they are checking up on in Kearny Mesa is turning out to be pretty big.”</p>
<p>“So they found the demon lord holing up there?”</p>
<p>He shrugged. “From the sound of things, probably. They don’t strike me as men who would leave something here on Z Street dangling unless they were tracking something even bigger.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s just hope that whatever is at the entrance of Z Street isn’t the real demon lord and that whatever is up there in Kearny Mesa is just a distraction to get them away from here.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like a predictable plot twist in an urban fantasy novel.”</p>
<p>“Let’s just hope we’re not in one.”</p>

",http://nanowrimo.org/participants/syaffolee/novels/sweet-diesel/stats,November 2013,"
<p>It had been a spur of the moment thing for the club owner who had cursed her into the race car. They had been standing outside at the back of the Station Lounge, a well-known establishment on the Rue Berger.  Gigi had gone out after her set of songs intent on heading to a party on the Left Bank, sponsored by an aging opera singer who had considered her one of her protégés.  The club owner, a man by the name of Albert Mitterand who had mysteriously ascended to the top of Parisian society a few years ago, had followed her out of the club on the pretext of speaking with her about extending her singing contract at the Station Lounge.  Gigi had initially gotten the gig at the Station Lounge for one week after a friend of hers had introduced her to the manager of the club, Monsieur Diderot, who was looking for someone to fill in the week's schedule after a previous act had bailed at the last minute.  The opportunity at the Station Lounge had been a golden one--it was a well-known club attended by the Parisian elite and it had also given her exposure to the rest of society.<br/><br/>After the first night at the Station Lounge, she had seen reviews of her performance in the newspapers.  The critics who had heard her had compared her to another one of the Station Lounge's singers and had found her superior.  They had dubbed her the ""Nightingale of Paris"" for her voice alone.  On the second evening, when she had been floating on a cloud of excitement because of her positive reviews, Diderot had mentioned to her nervously that she had to be careful because with the reviews, she had earned rivals and enemies. But as the rest of the week wore on and there was nothing but praise, she had put the manager's concerns out of her mind.<br/><br/>So she had thought nothing of it when Mitterand had mentioned extending her contract after the last show of the week.  What she hadn't anticipated was Mitterand's proposition--to replace the other Station Lounge's singer as his mistress in return for managing her career to even higher acclaim.<br/><br/>Gigi wasn't an inhibited woman.  She knew of love and had taken a number of lovers simply because it had pleased her.  Gigi also knew what it was to live precariously as a singer, not knowing where or when her next meal would come from.  There had been times when even sleeping in an abandoned doorway had been a luxury.  But despite all of that, she had never sold her body for anything.  Even the lure of stardom did not tempt her to do so.  If she couldn't advance her career through the Station Lounge, she would eventually find someplace else to sing, even if she had to move to America. <br/><br/>Mitterand cut the figure of a slick impresario, dressed in fine clothes and perfumed like a garden.  He was handsome in a way that it would be no hardship if she had decided to take him as a lover, but the entire situation felt wrong.  Perhaps it was the avarice that she had thought she had seen lurking behind his bright eyes.  So she had told Mitterand no and instead of accepting defeat—or even threatening to ruin her—after trying to cajole her to see his way, he had immediately flown into a rage. As the owner of the Station Lounge and part of the top of Parisian society, he was not used to being refused.<br/><br/>Then he showed his true colors—evidence that perhaps his mysterious rise in society had had some magical help. He cursed her into the nearest car parked at the back of the club, a Citroen, belonging to one of the patrons of the club.<br/><br/>For the first couple of minutes, she had been shocked and mute, unable to think of a way to get out of her predicament.  After Mitterand had stormed back into the club, a crowd of patrons from the Station Lounge had exited, one tall figure detaching himself from the milieu to make way towards the Citroen.  Even as her mind and soul were frozen into the vehicle, she had been aware of him as the owner and driver of the car.  While Mitterand had been golden and meticulously groomed, the driver possessed a mop of dark hair, carelessly mussed, and a rather devil-may-care swagger.  Right before he had reached the driver side door, though, someone called out his name, Raz, and had engaged him in a conversation about a race that was supposed to begin in a week. His voice had a rather faint but odd accent that made her think of her neighbors, a young couple from Prague who were trying to make it in Paris as photographers.<br/><br/>Gigi had absorbed all of this without at first knowing what the conversation was supposed to mean.  After Raz had finished talking to his acquaintance, he had finally got into the car.  Gigi had expected him to do the usual, to turn on the car and drive away from the Station Lounge to wherever he lived, but he didn't do that immediately.  Instead, he sat preternaturally still in the driver's seat as if he had heard something he didn't like.  <br/><br/>""I know you're here,"" he finally spoke.  ""Come out where I can see you.""<br/><br/>He was alone in the car. Except for her.  Gigi didn't think that he was talking to her at first.  She had thought that perhaps he was one of those crazy people who heard voices in his head.  But as the seconds ticked by and Raz didn't make any move to turn on the car, she began thinking that maybe he did know that she was now his car--especially after she had firsthand experience being cursed into one.<br/><br/>As a car, Gigi didn't have a voice.  But after some concentration, she was able to force the car radio to splutter with static.  She then managed to reply, ""I'm afraid it would be quite impossible for me to come out.""<br/><br/>She sensed him gaping at the radio for a moment.  Then he said, ""You're that singer from the club. How did you get into the radio?""<br/><br/>""I'm not in the radio, precisely.  I'm in your car. Or rather, I am your car after being cursed into it not just thirty minutes ago.""<br/><br/>But instead of throwing a panicked fit, he calmly started up the car and continued talking with her.  ""Now that's something that doesn't happen every day.  Who did you cross to earn this particular punishment?""<br/><br/>Gigi told him.<br/><br/>""Oh yes, Mitterand,"" Raz had replied dryly.  ""One day, all of his misdeeds will catch up with him, you mark my words.""<br/><br/>""I want to be human again,"" she had continued. ""I don't have any family, but I do have friends and they're going to wonder why I disappeared.  I need to get Mitterand to reverse the curse.""<br/><br/>""That would be next to impossible from what I have heard of him.  No one quite knows how he suddenly rose in society, but there are rumors that he isn't the sort of man you want to cross. He never changes his mind.""<br/><br/>""Then perhaps we should find a wizard who could help me get uncursed.""<br/><br/>To that, he had laughed.  ""You don't have to find a wizard,"" he said.  ""You have me.""<br/><br/>""You can turn me back into what I was?""<br/><br/>He had grinned at the hopeful tone in her voice.  ""I am not anyone's idea of a fairy godmother, babe. I don't do anything out of the goodness of my heart or for free.  Besides, I sort of like having the Nightingale of Paris in my car radio.  You can serenade me every time I go out for a drive.""<br/><br/>""I don't want to spend the rest of my existence singing to you.  What would it cost for you to reverse this curse on me?""<br/><br/>""Hm. Let me think."" <br/> <br/>While they had navigated the dark streets of early morning Paris towards the sixteenth arrondissement with its wide avenues, ornate buildings, and numerous museums, he tapped the steering wheel in thought.  The district where the Parisian elite lived in their chic, expensive apartments represented the aspirational lifestyle dreamed of by many, including Gigi.  With her most recent singing successes, that dream had seemed within reach.  But the curse had snatched it away again.  Raz pulled to park in front of one of the lavish residences, a building designed along the sleek and modern aesthetics of art deco.<br/><br/>""I have been invited to an off-road race next week.  It starts in Paris and ends in Dakar. Parts of it will be in the desert.  You help me win the race and I'll break the curse.""<br/><br/>She had let out a relieved sigh, punctuated with the static of the radio.  ""I know nothing about racing, but I'll try anything at this point to be myself again. If you don't win the race, does that mean you'll help me find someone else who can break the curse?""<br/><br/>""No.  If I don't win the race, your soul is going to belong to me.""<br/><br/>""What do you mean by that?""<br/><br/>""Well, think of it this way.  I own this car.  At the moment, you are the car.  Which means I own you.  I'm under no obligation to let you go.""<br/><br/>""Wait! That's ridiculous! That's...""<br/><br/>Before she could finish, he got out of the car and laughed.  ""Oh, babe, we're going to have so much fun.  Of course, if you annoy me before all of this is over, I'll just send you to the junkyard.  I can well afford a race car that can't talk back.""<br/><br/>Gigi had spluttered at that and desperately wished that she could manipulate more than the radio so that she could run him over. Twice.<br/></p>

<p>A genetically engineered factory worker makes a bid for freedom by posing as a mail-order bride.</p>

<p>The train disgorged the mail-order brides who fluttered into the station like a flock of nervous pastel-colored doves.  Nine Lily Rendell hung back a few paces.  She looked no different than the others in her light blue-gray traveling frock, matching hat, and purse. But it wasn't an ordinary purse.  It contained a Colt single action .45 with several metallic cartridges loaded in the revolving cylinder.  One of the bullets was intended for her would-be husband.<br/><br/>Well, Nine amended to herself, it would be used as a last resort if her current plans to become a free woman went seriously awry.<br/><br/>The exhaust from the resting steam engine choked the air with fumes.  Nine covered her nose with the back of her hand as she made her way across the station platform where the rest of the women mingled, with part excitement and part apprehension.  There was a small iron gate which separated the station platform from the other side of the station and the men who were waiting for them.<br/><br/>The women had come from various towns out east.  As Nine was traveling with them, she learned that many of them had taken a chance on moving west and marrying strangers to escape their hometowns which had little opportunity for spinsters with no apparent prospects.<br/><br/>Nine was escaping for similar reasons, although she couldn't really care less if her prospects for marriage were positive or negative.  Instead, she was heading west for far more basic reasons.  To be free.  Especially from the endless factory drudgery that she had been born into.<br/><br/>One of the station managers tipped his hat to the women and went over to the gate to open it for them.  They spilled over to the other side, most of them taking cautious steps towards the crowd of people waiting on the other side.  Briefly, Nine looked back at the train which had been her home for the past two days.  Workers were already heading towards the baggage car to get the trunks and bags which the women had taken with them on their journey to a new life.  A second group of workers were at a couple cars ahead to take other cargo out--materials sold from the east.  And a little further from that, she saw a herd of cattle standing by, probably ready to be shipped out to the slaughter house.<br/> <br/>Finally, the woman in front of her had stepped passed the gate and now it was her turn.  Nine was aware that the passing of this threshold was a step towards a completely different life, a life that she was at the moment completely ignorant of.  Too many questions crowded her brain and she could only muster a weak smile at the station manager as she passed him.  The man gave her a sympathetic expression, perhaps mistaking her nervousness for the nervousness in meeting a prospective husband.<br/><br/>But once she stepped out towards the front of the station, she was suddenly in the midst of an even stranger gathering of people, of mail-order brides attempting to find a men they had only corresponded before by letter.  And, Nine supposed, she should be doing the same thing.<br/><br/>Back when she had been working at the factory, she had seen an advertisement in the back of a newspaper that she had seen discarded in the street right outside of the tenement house that she had been living in.  For some reason, the advertisement had sparked something in her, to find a way out of the drudgery that so far, had been her entire life.  So she had written to the man who had placed the advertisement, mostly thinking that it wouldn't hurt to try even if numerous better prospects had also sent letters to him.  And to her surprise, she heard back.  And after a few exchanges, he offered to pay for her train ticket out west to see if they could suit.<br/><br/>She had written back saying yes, and that he could recognize her because she was wearing a brass pin in the shape of a sleeping cat on the lapel of her jacket.  She figured that it would be simple enough.  It would be too hard to describe herself as she had never been created to look particularly distinctive.  And from his last letter, which came with the train ticket, he had said that she would recognize him by the white carnation in his breast pocket.<br/><br/>At the station, there were a number of men with flowers pinned to their suits.  What were the chances, she wondered, that more than one of them had the same flower?  From her conversations with the other women on the train, though, she knew that no one else had a cat pin so if worse came to worse, if she couldn't recognize him, certainly he would recognize her.<br/><br/>Several men glanced at her, but once seeing the cat pin, turned elsewhere.  Momentarily at a loss at how to find anyone in the crowd, Nine was easily distracted by the commotion on the other side of the station as the train workers began hauling all of the trunks and baggage off to one area where the passengers could more easily find their things.  It was then, while she was watching the workers, that she became aware that someone was watching her.  Slowly, she turned around.</p>

<p>Wray of Despina wants revenge.  The House of the Black Cockatrice killed his father, disgraced his mother, and crushed all chance that he could become the next Seer.  He would do anything to destroy this House for the wreck it has made of his life, even if it means enduring dangers from beyond the known multiverses.<br/><br/>Mad Dita is the descendant of a long line knot finders and knot jumpers, cartographers and navigators bred by the technologically advanced Ancients to travel the byways that tether cities in different parallel universes.  But after a violent altercation with her former employer leaves her awaiting trial for murder, she has no choice but to accept Wray's offer to drop the murder charges and to use her skills to aid his quest for vengence.<br/><br/>The key to Wray's plans is a book left behind by the Ancients that purportedly explains how the tethers between cities were made, maintained, and destroyed.  As Wray and Dita jump from city to city on the trail of this book, they discover they have a far bigger problem.  Ever since the Ancients disappeared several centuries ago, the tethers have been mysteriously deteriorating and snapping.  Even if Wray succeeds in breaking the House of the Black Cockatrice, they may never be able to go home again.</p>

<p>“Knot finders are like the undead. You can't kill them unless you take off the head.”<br/><br/>The official inquisitor of the Hall of Justice squinted at Wray. “There's no such thing as the undead, Your Honor.” He shook the square bottle in his right hand and the remaining poison sloshed around the glass like liquid emeralds . The other half had been poured down the throat of the inquisitor's latest subject, a woman strapped to a rack a few feet away. She was barefoot. The rest of her clothing were rags. And her head hung down with dark tangled hair obscuring her features. Her body twitched for a moment before relaxing. She raised her head revealing strange brown-gold eyes. Something wrong skittered behind her gaze.<br/><br/>Wray gave the inquisitor a stingy smile. “Any more of that and she will be of no use.”<br/><br/>“I'm just trying to do my job, Your Honor.” The inquisitor smiled back revealing black teeth. “Justice wanted a confession so I'm going to give 'em one.”<br/><br/>“The truth serum works best in smaller doses.”<br/><br/>“Well, what will you have me do? The git won't say anything no matter what I do.”<br/><br/>“I have a better idea.” Wray folded his arms until they disappeared under the folds of his gray-green judicial robes. A joke, he thought, on him. He was no judge. But unlike others who fell into the thankless job and never got out again, he was going to do something about it. And the wretch on the rack was his ticket to it. “Extracting a confession and capital punishment are mere formalities under the law. The evidence is quite clear on the matter. And the victim has no friends or family, in this jurisdiction at least, who could plead otherwise. I've spoken with Calner. The knot finder will be of more use to us alive than dead.”<br/><br/>“Oh? What sort of use?”<br/><br/>“For traversing broken tethers.”<br/><br/>The woman on the rack screeched. “No! Just kill me now. That's suicide!”<br/><br/>The inquisitor set the bottle of poison down on a nearby table and scratched his head. “Well, if that's the case, I'd say the use would be worse than the punishment. Broken tethers are supposedly impossible unless you're a legendary Ancient. Are you sure you don't want me to continue to extract a confession?”<br/><br/>“I'm sure.”<br/><br/>The woman screamed. “You bastard! You don't know what the hell you're asking, you privileged toad. There are things on the tethers you don't know about. And if you knew about them, you'd think twice about traversing the tethers, even to see dear old grandma. There are things out there. Things that if you saw, you'd want to gouge your eyes out.” She began thrashing around on the rack, but the leather ropes held and all she succeeded in doing was tangling her hair further.<br/><br/>“The git is mad,” said the inquisitor as he rolled his eyes. “There's no rhyme or reason to her fits. You say something, it could be anything, and she goes off. Nearly skewered one of my assistants earlier when he decided to question her about her family.”<br/><br/>“Mad or not, knot finders are hard to come by,” said Wray. “Even harder to come by are any knot finders who will traverse a broken tether. Or in this case, unwillingly.”<br/><br/>“Good luck with that. It's going to be difficult to have her come along with you with the git in this state. Do you want me to use the tranquilizer?” “Have you used the tranquilizer on her before?”<br/><br/>“No. But there's always a first time for everything.”<br/><br/>Wray half expected for the tranquilizer to fail. After all, the truth serum that the inquisitor had forced into her had not worked. But after the inquisitor topped off a syringe with a clear liquid he obtained from a thin blue bottle sitting next to the truth serum and jabbed it into the woman's flailing arm, she suddenly went still as if an invisible wind had sucked out all of her energy.</p>

<p>It was near the end of my late night shift when contestant number six managed to decapitate herself with the sonic toothbrush.<br/><br/>Instead of calling the emergency medical personnel first, the producer decided to call the director. It took a full ten minutes before the people in orange finally swarmed apartment six to take away what was left of the two pieces of the body. The message stream on my eye screen exploded into a flurry of outrage, disbelief, and cynical snarking.<br/><br/>I needed a drink. Preferably something strong enough to knock me off my feet.<br/><br/>“Good God,” exclaimed my co-worker for the fifth time. Whatever his name, maybe Bob, had just started working on the set of Extreme Living on New Caledonia, the latest in a long line of holographic reality shows produced by the Galactic Broadcasting Corporation, last week.<br/><br/>I tapped a few commands on the control panel and squinted at the monitoring screens in front of us. The scenes switched rapidly between the different apartments where the rest of the contestants resided. They were either all in bed or just getting out of bed. So far, so good.<br/><br/>“You should have been here earlier this season,” I told Bob. “Contestant number two blew himself up when he attempted to fire up a grill for the cooking challenge. And contestant number ten split his head open with the vertical challenge.”<br/><br/>“I thought this was just a show about twentieth-century living. I thought it was primitive but not that dangerous.”<br/><br/>“You must be kidding me, right?” I glanced at him, the silver words of the message stream giving his sweaty face a strange glow. “Did you sleep through history class?”<br/><br/>Bob just shook his head and stared at the monitor, wiping his forehead. I turned back. The scene had flickered back to apartment six. One of the emergency medical personnel was holding contestant number six's head. Her expression was of faint surprise.<br/><br/>I slumped in my seat, rubbing my eyes. I had one more hour before I was off. But given what had happened, I would probably end up spending an extra hour up briefing the morning crew on the latest set mishap. I wanted to sleep, not describe a decapitation to another holographic projectionist who probably wouldn't care anyway.<br/><br/>This was not something that I had imagined that I would do when I grew up. I wanted to make meaningful entertainment. Art. Everything was going so well when I got into the Andromeda Film School. And then I decided to make a documentary for my first year project. That was when everything went to hell.<br/><br/>And now, I was a temp at a substandard reality show where even contestants dying in cruel and unusual ways were doing nothing to stop the declining ratings.<br/><br/>The door at the back of the control room hissed open and the footsteps of the producer clumped toward us. The thick man with thinning hair stopped at the space between our chairs and brandished his data pad like a sword. “You two will have to stay here until the next shift arrives. What have you got on the vids?”<br/><br/>“Nothing of interest, sir,” Bob answered promptly as he straightened his back. Probably hoping to impress him. It wasn't going to work. He'd realize that after the first month. “The vids show contestant number six getting the sonic toothbrush to brush her teeth and turning it on when it suddenly exploded.”<br/><br/>“Damn.” The producer whacked his data pad against the back of Bob's chair. “That means we'll have to shell out the dough to her grieving family. There's no way we can call it a suicide?”<br/><br/>Bob glanced at me, looking even more nervous.<br/><br/>“No,” I said. I had been sending out my resume for the past three months. I had stopped trying to please the higher ups long ago. I didn't quit because, well, there was the paycheck. But for some reason, they had yet to fire me.<br/><br/>The producer gave me a sour look before he turned back to Bob. “Show me the vid feed again.”<br/><br/>I leaned back as my co-worker jiggled with the controls. The message stream on my eye screen had already trickled down to a few half-hearted jokes about when the show will finally kill itself off. A few of the messages were flagged. Those were from my parents. I ignored them. Then something flashed at the bottom of the eye screen. An incoming message of importance.<br/><br/>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw that Bob and the producer were still examining the vids. I tapped my hands against my thighs to activate the sensors on the pads of my fingertips. I moved my fingers in specific patterns and accessed the message on my eye screen. The written message was short and to the point.<br/><br/>“Dear Ms. Euphrosyne Tanaka-Teng, We have reviewed your application and we are pleased to offer you a position on one of our experimental programs in development. This new show will be headed directly by Nigel Mot. If you wish to accept this position, please report to GBC headquarters as soon as possible. Sincerely, Rosalind Hect, GBC Program Coordinator.”<br/><br/>I stared at the silver words on my eye screen for a long moment before I rapidly typed out a terse response: “I accept.”<br/><br/>The message sent, I blew out a breath. A job. A real job where I could actually utilize my skills instead of sitting in a small control room like an underpaid security robot.<br/><br/>“You know, I'm not an expert about this,” the producer said, breaking my momentary euphoria. “Maybe we should show this to our lawyers.”<br/><br/>“All right.” Bob looked pale as if he was about to keel over in a faint. Shock, perhaps. This was the first time he had witnessed a death on the set. The producer nodded at that and then left.<br/><br/>“Maybe you should see a counselor,” I told him. “This sort of stuff can be hard for first timers.”<br/><br/>“Yeah. That sounds like a good idea.” He tried to shake his head and then he really did keel over.<br/><br/>I stared at Bob's body for a moment, not seeing the message stream continuing to scroll past my eyes. Screw it, the newbies always did this. I finally got out of my chair and walked out of the control room. I caught one of the emergency personnel walking by. The woman was holding a silver canister of decontaminant.<br/><br/>“There's a guy in there. I think he needs help.”<br/><br/>When she moved toward the control room, I quickly headed the opposite direction, avoiding the glance of the producer who was talking to another member of the crew. I slipped into the lift. I had been clocked out when I had exited the set floor. With the lift to myself, I trigged my fingers to send a message to the director.<br/><br/>“I quit.”<br/><br/>I walked out of the film building and into the New Caledonian morning feeling freer than I had in what seemed like forever.</p>

<p>June 7, 1815<br/><br/>When Greta pulled off her blindfold, she realized that the mingling scents of camphor and smoked meat filling her nose emanated from a severed hand. The hand of glory, dipped in pale green wax and mounted on a squat pewter base glittered with fingertip flames at the center of the room.<br/><br/>“This way, Miss Silber.”<br/><br/>Someone jabbed at her from behind and she stumbled one step forward, over a thick line of salt on a worn stone floor. Where was she? All that Mr. Wechsler had told her was that his employer, the Margrave of Baden, required her presence in a ceremony if she wanted to start repaying her father's debts.<br/><br/>“Stay, right here.” Wechsler, a thin dour man in a black coat, took the blindfold from her hands and gave her a rheumy stare as if that would intimidate her into place. Greta only glared back. Wechsler shook his head and walked over to a dark shadow hunched over on the floor, drawing the marks on the stone with grains of salt.<br/><br/>It was then that Greta noticed that she was not alone. An old woman in a rich, fur-lined pelisse sat in a straight-backed chair next to the table that contained the hand and other odd implements. Behind her stood a boy—perhaps fourteen or fifteen—attempting to cover a yawn with the back of his hand. The salt markings on the floor made a circle enclosing the people in the room. Beyond the circle, she could only see the inky blackness of the room punctuated by shades of dark gray which she assumed were outlines of the furnishings. Whether she was in a tower room or an underground dungeon, it was impossible to tell.<br/><br/>The dark figure to whom Wechsler had been speaking with finally rose from his crouched position and moved toward the table. The weak light from the hand of glory caught at his facial features, throwing them in almost demonic relief. But Greta recognized him. He had been one of her father's customers at the apothecary. Or rather one of her customers, really, since he always dropped by on her shift. She hadn't wanted to do business with him—his demeanor, although polite, made her want to run—but she hadn't the choice. They had needed the money. And with her father gone and debts piling up, she had no choice now either.<br/><br/>“You brought the girl?” The man's voice curled around her, velvet and cold.<br/><br/>Wechsler gave a sigh. “Yes, my lord. Although I have no idea what use she will be.”<br/><br/>“Of course not. You're not the one doing this ritual, are you?” Wechsler looked affronted with his implication, but the dark figure ignored the man's spluttering. Then he turned to her, his eyes black. “Miss Silber. I am glad you are here. I'm afraid we are in need of your services.”<br/><br/>“It's not like I have another option, do I, Mr. Schmidt?” she said. “I was given to understand that if I did not attend this ceremony, the Margrave would not forgive my father's debts.”<br/><br/>Wechsler's spluttering turned into a hasty cough which obscured whatever that he was about to blurt out. Despite his sleepy state, the boy smirked. The only indication that the old woman noticed was a flicker of an eyelid.<br/><br/>Schmidt only raised an eyebrow. “Did Wechsler never tell you?”<br/><br/>“Tell me what?”<br/><br/>The thin man nervously cleared his throat. “Actually, Miss Silber, he is the Margrave.”<br/><br/>Greta fisted her hands in her skirts. “Did my father already know you were the Margrave? Why come into our shop under the pretense that you were some sort of Mr. Schmidt, a visiting pharmacist from the south? Or did he not know, my lord?”<br/><br/>“Not everyone knows of my presence in Heiligenberg and I would like to keep it that way.” Briefly, he turned away from her to drop his half empty pouch of salt onto the table. “In the meantime, stay within the circle.”<br/><br/>“Why?”<br/><br/>Wechsler frowned. “You don't ask the Margrave 'why'.”<br/><br/>“The circle is for your protection,” the Margrave replied as he positioned the items on the table. A knife with a golden hilt, a silver bowl, a pewter bell with a worn wooden handle, and a small opaque vial. “I will be performing a summoning. I am fairly certain that it will be a specific one, but you can't be too sure about these kinds of things. Sometimes, things you don't want will take advantage of the opportunities that you've provided.”<br/><br/>Greta had heard rumors about the current Margrave of Baden. Not much of it was good. “You're a necromancer.”<br/><br/>“I prefer to be called a post-life facilitator.”<br/><br/>“That's still a necromancer,” the boy spoke up.<br/><br/>“Hush, Franz,” the old woman said, reaching up to pat his elbow. “The Margrave needs to concentrate.”<br/><br/>Franz hunched his shoulders and huffed.<br/><br/>The Margrave finally turned back to look at the boy and the old woman. “There is no one else in the house?”<br/><br/>The old woman shook her head. “The servants were given the night off. Josef, Hanna, and Lena are out tonight visiting Hanna's sister. They should not be back until much later.”<br/><br/>“Good.” The Margrave beckoned toward Greta to come closer. “Stand by the table. I will need you soon when I activate this circle and start the summoning.”<br/><br/>Reluctantly, she stepped towards the table. When she looked down, she could see the faint reflection of her face and the candlelight in the water still rippling in the bowl. As she was examining the scrolling on the knife's hilt, the Margrave had stepped away to consecrate the four cardinal directions of the circle. For a moment, Greta thought that the salt on the floor glowed when he made a quick motion with his hands, but it was quick, making her think that she might be seeing things.<br/><br/>“Miss Silber, give me your palm.”<br/><br/>“What for?”<br/><br/>At her question, Wechsler at the other side of the table, hissed between his teeth in annoyance.<br/><br/>The Margrave seemed to ignore the noise. “The summoning requires a sacrifice.”<br/><br/>“I can't be the...ow!” Before she had a chance to protest, he had grasped her wrist and flicked the blade of the knife across her palm, opening her skin. Blood oozed out as he cut his own palm.<br/><br/>“Hold your hand over the bowl like this.” He put his hand over the bowl, palm downward. She did the same and watched as a drop of blood from each of their hands fell into the water almost simultaneously. He whispered something that she didn't quite catch and the water turned black and opaque. When he took his hand away from the bowl, she did like-wise. But without a bandage in sight, Greta held up her palm and watched her blood pool and slowly clot.<br/><br/>The Margrave stepped close to the edge of the circle. In a voice that seemed to reverberate in the room, he uttered a few strange words that sounded like a mixture of Latin and Arabic. Something from beyond the circle groaned. The blackness in the corners of the room shifted.<br/><br/>The old woman gasped and almost stood up had the boy not held her down by her shoulders. “Albert? Albert? Is that you?” she called out.<br/><br/>“Shh, Grandma. Didn't you tell me that we had to be quiet so that the Margrave could work?”<br/><br/>The Margrave did not appear to have heard the exchange. Instead, he watched the room outside the circle intently. “Is this Albert Ritter to whom I am speaking?”<br/><br/>“Yes.” The answer from the corner of the room sounded like a man's voice, but there was a hollow quality to it that made the hairs on the back of Greta's neck prickle.<br/><br/>“It's Albert,” the old woman whispered.<br/><br/>“Albert Ritter, when and where you were born?”<br/><br/>“January fourth. 1737. In Munich.”<br/><br/>“Is that correct, Mrs. Ritter?”<br/><br/>The old woman nodded vigorously. “Yes, of course it's correct. Besides, it sounds just like him.”<br/><br/>“Some spirits can imitate others voices,” the Margrave said without looking back at her. “We cannot depend on that to verify identity.”<br/><br/>“Oh. All right.”<br/><br/>“Ask him something that only he and you would know.”<br/><br/>She sighed. “Albert, tell me, what did you say to me right after we were married?”<br/><br/>There was a pause in the darkness and Greta found herself flexing her fingers. What if the spirit beyond the circle answered incorrectly? Would the Margrave then banish the spirit?<br/><br/>“I told you that I was pleased with the transaction.”<br/><br/>Greta frowned at the strange answer, but Mrs. Ritter seemed very relieved. “Yes, yes that's it,” the spirit's widow replied. “My lord, that is indeed Albert.”<br/><br/>“Very well, then. Albert Ritter, who was your supplier from the east?”<br/><br/>There was a rustle in the room as if someone was pacing along the stone floor. “I had many suppliers.”<br/><br/>“Can you name them?”<br/><br/>“I did not bother with these details.”<br/><br/>“Do you know who will have this information?”<br/><br/>The rustling stopped. The air just outside the salt circle wavered, but when Greta blinked, the mirage was gone.<br/><br/>“My solicitor.”<br/><br/>“Damn.”<br/><br/>Startled by the expletive, Greta glanced back at the Margrave. He stood stiffly, unhappy with the spirit's answer. His hands had curled into fists.<br/><br/>“I am sorry,” Albert Ritter's shade finally replied. The spirit's voice sounded more hollow and thready. “I must go now.”<br/><br/>“Albert!” The old woman had finally wrestled out of her grandson's grip and had stood up from her chair. But she made no move toward the border of the circle.<br/><br/>“When it's your time, Sophie. I will see you.” The air rippled again and the lights on the hand of glory flickered once, indicating that the spirit had finally left.<br/><br/>The old woman slumped back into her chair to pull out a handkerchief to dab her eyes. Franz's fingers tightened on his grandmother's frail shoulders as he bent his head to whisper reassurance in her ears.<br/><br/>The Margrave strode toward the table in quick, angry steps. “This is intolerable.”<br/><br/>“My lord,” began Wechsler, “The ghost of Mrs. Ritter's husband answered you...”<br/><br/>“The answer is no use to us,” his employer replied as he stared down at the objects on the table. “Albert Ritter's solicitor is as dead as he is.”<br/><br/>“Since everything is already set up, can't we just summon the solicitor as well?” The Margrave answered, but Greta was not listening at this point. Instead, her attention was riveted to the darkness outside the protective circle. She was sure that Albert Ritter's shade had gone back to the other world with his last words, but something else was out there. It was as if some sort of pressure was coming down to bear upon the shield the Margrave had cast with the circle. And it smelled faintly like the smoldering coals on a hearth.<br/><br/>Greta remembered a bit of folklore she had heard about the hand of glory. The left hand of a criminal, made into a candle, had the ability when lit to open doorways. Sometimes, things you don't want will take advantage of the opportunities that you've provided. The Margrave's previous words echoed in her head and she found herself straining to catch any movement beyond the circle.<br/><br/>There were footsteps and voices—from outside of the room. The presence that had taken advantage of Albert Ritter's departure seemed to pause, as if it too sensed the others.<br/><br/>“Grandma! Grandma! Where are you?”<br/><br/>“Lena! Come back here at once. You know your grandmother is probably already asleep. You need to go to bed right now.”<br/><br/>“No, Mama. I think Grandma is over here.”<br/><br/>At that moment, the Margrave forcibly pulled himself away from his argument with his employee and stepped towards the border of the circle. “Don't come in here!” he bellowed.<br/><br/>The door to the darkened room burst open, spilling in light from beyond. The presence lurking just beyond the circle hissed in delight and Greta felt sweat breaking upon her brow as if she had suddenly stepped into a blacksmith's forge.<br/><br/>“No, Lena, go back!” cried Franz.<br/><br/>“Franz, Grandma, what are you doing here?”<br/><br/>“Don't cross the threshold!” The Margrave shouted. But he was too late.<br/><br/>A small girl child in a white jacket embroidered with silver tripped into the room like a coin tossed into a dark well. “Grandma?”<br/><br/>“Lena!” The girls' mother stood at the doorway, transfixed at the scene and let out a scream.<br/><br/>With the extra light from the doorway, Greta could now make out the presence closing in—a vaguely humanoid shape as tall as the ceiling with a void-like maw that sucked in any light that reached it. The creature stretched out with a spindly limb toward the child.<br/><br/>Greta moved, throwing her body through the invisible barrier that the Margrave had erected and scattering the salt, leaving behind gritty white trails along the floor.<br/><br/>“Mama!”<br/><br/>Her arm loped around the child's waist just as the creature's limb reached them. The darkness touched her sleeve and she smelled burning fabric.<br/><br/>“Foolish woman, you'll get us all killed!”<br/><br/>Someone, a human someone, grabbed her free hand and yanked her back inside the broken circle. The child came with her, but as she tumbled to the floor, the girl burst out of her hold to run to her grandmother and brother. Dazed, she looked up and saw the Margrave standing at the circle border with the knife held toward the creature in his uninjured hand. Greta looked down at her own hands, thinking numbly that not all the blood smeared against her cut palm was her own.<br/><br/>“Go back from where you came from,” the Margrave commanded.<br/><br/>The creature seemed to laugh at his words and with its arms, moved toward him.<br/><br/>The Margrave uttered another command, in a different language, just as the creature loomed over him like a shroud. At the same moment, Greta felt something sharp tugging at the gash in her hand, digging through the wound to grab something in her chest. She noticed the Margrave's eyes widen as if he too felt the pain, before her own vision flickered to nothing. </p>

<p>With a bag of groceries in his left arm, Banner slouched against the lamppost in front of his great-uncle's vacation house and watched the burglar punch in a code on the front door panel. The woman was wearing a black thermal suit with a hood which covered her hair. Her glove covered fingers swept the keypad in quick ease. A second later, the door hissed open.<br/><br/>“Bravo,” Banner said, finally breaking the silence. “That took you about ten seconds.”<br/><br/>The woman paused and turned her head. The hood shadowed part of her face, but he could tell she had a burnished complexion and familiar eyes the color of twilight. “It would have taken two if you had not changed the code.” The voice wasn't so familiar. It had the texture of dark wind.<br/><br/>“I could ask you what you are doing here.” He straightened and walked forward. The woman didn't move, even when he stood toe to toe with her. “This is my home now.”<br/><br/>She regarded him solemnly. “In his will, Jorge Helado gave me an open invitation. I was under the impression that the new owner wasn't going to be here until a week from now.”<br/><br/>“Well, you're mistaken.” She seemed cool and collected, as if she wasn't perturbed at all that she had been caught breaking and entering. “I wasn't informed of this.”<br/><br/>“You can contact my lawyer if you want proof that I'm telling the truth.”<br/><br/>“I think I will.”<br/><br/>It was then that she moved back, but instinctively, he reached out to touch her elbow. She froze.<br/><br/>“What are you doing here?” This time, he wasn't referring to the reason that she had given before.<br/><br/>Her lips faintly thinned. “Perhaps you should invite me in.”<br/><br/>The last time he had met with Cimarron Tong-Radcliff had been almost fourteen years ago, at a party his great-uncle had thrown for him before he shipped off to his first job on Makemake. Ordinarily, he would not have noticed her as a gangly teenager except for her violet hair. It wasn't dyed, but it wasn't exactly natural either. Her parents, a renowned geneticist and an Alpha Centauran diplomat, had introduced her as their daughter. She had features from both her parents, but then again, there was something about her that came off as wrong. The hair color was just the tip of it.<br/><br/>Later, Uncle Jorge had casually mentioned that she had been altered beyond her or her parents' control by a now defunct biotechnology company that had stolen embryos to be used in an experimental project to produce “courtesans” for well-heeled businessmen. Her parents were attempting to raise her to overcome her unnatural genetics by enrolling her into science programs. Other than those terse facts, he didn't give specifics and Banner hadn't asked. But sometimes, his great-uncle would repeat rumors.<br/><br/>Banner motioned for her to precede him, and after he stepped through the threshold, the front door slid shut. With their presence, the interior lights brightened, revealing a hexagonal receiving room painted blue and sparsely decorated with solid white panels along the wall. Next to the door was a window facing the interior of Nowhere City's South Dome which was peppered with a row of utilitarian buildings. The dome itself was invisible, allowing the distant sunlight to filter in.<br/><br/>Opposite of the front door was an archway to the interior of the house—a living room washed in beige merging with what looked like a metallic kitchen bay. Banner placed his bag of groceries on the counter in the kitchen before taking off his knit cap and unzipping his jacket. Cimarron slowly approached the living room and took off her hood before casually glancing around.<br/><br/>“You took his sculptures down?”<br/><br/>He leaned against the counter to watch her. “No. They weren't here when I got here.”<br/><br/>She crossed her arms. “Last I heard you got sent to Tartaros without a chance for parole.”<br/><br/>Banner took a deep breath and tried to unclench has hands which had latched themselves to the edge of the kitchen bay when she had mentioned the prison planet on Epsilon Eridanus.<br/><br/>“Well, someone got me out, out of the goodness of their hearts. So what are you doing here? Before I got dumped on that hell hole, I heard you were doing a doctorate in computer science at some swanky university and was engaged to some high-flying socialite.”<br/><br/>She shrugged. “My plans changed. I decided to ditch the university and the fiancé. And decided to do a stint at a Tibetian convent.”<br/><br/>“Huh.”<br/><br/>“So are you or aren't you going to contact my lawyer to see if what I'm saying is true?”<br/><br/>“Sure. But first, let's assume that Jorge did give you that open invitation. Why come here now?”<br/><br/>“Would you believe me if I said sentimental reasons?”<br/><br/>“Not really. But then again, I don't believe anyone anymore.” He turned and walked to the other side of the kitchen bay to give a command which opened a view screen on the opposite wall. He slanted her a glance. “Your lawyer's name?”<br/><br/>She readily gave up the information which he used to contact the lawyer. In a few moments, he had him on the line and confirmed what Cimarron had told him. After a few questions, he also confirmed that she had an open invitation despite the fact that he was now the owner of his great-uncle's vacation house.<br/><br/>“Why am I not surprised that this all comes down to a loophole,” Banner said when he signed off the communication. “I suppose I'll have to resign myself that you'll be staying here.”<br/><br/>The corner of her mouth quirked upward, finally revealing some sort of emotion. “You don't have to worry about me imposing on you. I have a room reserved at the local hotel. I was merely visiting.”<br/><br/>“Breaking in, you mean. But I have a feeling the authorities will believe you more than they do me,” he replied cynically. </p>

<p>With the storm clouds spitting overhead, Green Alley didn't look very green. Rather, it was a pitch dark maw surrounded by dirty buildings and paved with pitted cobblestones filling up with muddy rain. Hesitation allowed a gust of wind to tug at my umbrella. Firming my grip on the handle, I decided to move.<br/><br/>The only indication that Parrish Books existed was a few wooden steps leading up to a door which had probably seen fresh green paint some time in the last century. A small tarnished plaque was mounted to the right and faint light emanated from the small window panes on the top half of the door. I tugged on the handle and pushed. A small bell on the threshold tinkled at my entrance.<br/><br/>I managed to shake my umbrella closed and stepped inside. Dim electrical lighting hung like flat demented fireflies from the ceiling. Dark wood shelves lined a small room—each crammed with books, leather-bound and paper-bound. All old and well used. The smell of musty tomes permeated the air. I imagined that it was what I would have smelled like if I had not been walking on two legs.<br/><br/>A counter sat in the left corner, laden with more books, a lamp with a hideous shade the color of molding olives, and a white-haired man bent over doing accounting. He did not look up even as I squelched across the floor to pretend to examine the nearest shelf. Beyond the counter was an archway to the rest of the shop—the back room, I guessed—that was either a kitchen or a storage room. As I slowly sidled my way toward the proprietor, I noticed another customer in the opposite corner of the shop—a dark-haired man in a tweed jacket deeply absorbed in what looked like a heavy reference book. An unkempt professor, I assumed, and turned my attention back to the old man.<br/><br/>Finally at the counter, I cleared my throat. ""Mr. Parrish?""<br/><br/>Pen continued scratching on paper. ""How may I help you, Miss?""<br/><br/>""I am quite hopeful that you can. I've been directed here by an acquaintance of mine. He told me that you would know something about a particular book that I have been trying to find for my research.""<br/><br/>""What book is this?""<br/><br/>""The <em>Liber Tutelarum</em>.""<br/><br/>The pen stopped and a trembling hand set it down on paper. Curiously, I watched the old man raise his head and meet my eyes with a rheumy blue gaze. ""Who is your acquaintance?"" His voice hid a nervous energy. Or Parrish was just annoyed because he needed to go to the water closet at the moment. Even after all these years, I sometimes still found it hard to distinguish human emotion. I took it as a good sign that the old man did not just tell me no.<br/><br/>""Professor Wallace at the Institute. I work as his research assistant. He's on a short sabbatical, currently, so I am working on a pet project of mine. There was this small sect of monks in the thirteenth century who had dedicated themselves to copying some texts...""<br/><br/>Parrish slashed a hand in the air to cut me off. ""Tell your professor that he is misinformed. I know of no such book. Parrish Books specializes in first editions of epic poetry—preferably from the eighteenth century. If you're looking for a book written by a monk, go to a church.""<br/><br/>""Not all books copies by monks have remained in church libraries,"" I argued. ""Even if you have never come across the book that I am looking for, perhaps you have some idea, some acquaintance of yours who I could ask.""<br/><br/>""I know no one.""<br/><br/>""Mr. Parrish."" I straightened and looked down my nose at him. I knew the expression combined with the short-brimmed cloche hat on my head had the effect of rendering the opposing person into a contrite mess. ""That is impossible. All antiquarian booksellers have their sources. Otherwise, how would they get any of their stock?""<br/><br/>A faint chuckle had me reflexively whipping my head around to glare at the offending person. The other customer was peering up from the book he was browsing with evil amusement. ""You'll never get anything out of Parrish,"" he told me ominously.<br/><br/>I turned my attention back to the bookseller. ""Surely you have a colleague who knows something of thirteenth century literature,"" I said, attempting to sweeten my tone.<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>""Do I have to repeat myself? I. Know. No. One. Now, Miss, either take a look at some of the fine copies of love poetry on that shelf or go away.""<br/><br/>""That's a fine way to treat a potential customer."" His hostile attitude intrigued me. Obviously he had something to hide. ""Do I look like I'm looking for love poetry?""<br/><br/>""Bah. You're probably one of those suffragettes,"" the old man sniffed.<br/><br/>With one more glance at the interior of the bookshop, I decided on a strategic retreat, for now. Parrish would probably clam up further if I were to forcefully pursue my inquiries. ""Pardon me, then. Good day.""<br/><br/>The bookseller ignored me.<br/><br/>I let out a breath and squelched back towards the entrance. But before I could open the door, it slammed open, striking me on the shoulder. Unbalanced, I stumbled back and tripped over a small footstool.</p>

<p>Writers and poets claimed that one of the properties of poppy wine was to numb the senses and to give fleeting dreams more substance. It had an altogether different effect on Haidée. Yes, it eliminated her headache, but in the process it made her feel altogether more sensitive to reality. At the moment, she couldn’t recall any of her dreams. Although under the circumstances, it was hard to recall anything when her favorite pair of slippers from Paris was sinking into the mud.<br/><br/>Haidée stood somewhat apart from the accident. The traveling coach had gotten stuck in the muck that was the temporary causeway from the mainland to Mont Saint Filan. The natural roadway which was studded with perilous traps of sinkholes and quicksand—one of which had ensnarled the back wheels of her transportation—was only revealed once a month when the full moon and the tides converged. Briefly, Haidée looked away from the men struggling to push the coach out of the mud to glance at the hulking monolith that was her destination.<br/><br/>The debris of broken shells and driftwood littered causeway led to an island shadowed in the late afternoon sun, its white cliffs burnished a dark copper in the light. Further in the distance was the sea with its ominous glitter—a threat of its return. The stink of sea life vied with the screeching seagulls overhead for loudness. Haidée watched one of the birds dig up a small clam from the exposed sediment and smash it onto a nearby rock to get into its contents.<br/><br/>Two men were pushing the back of the coach—one lean, one fat. The lean one said, “It’s almost there Felix. Have the horses pull it a bit more to the left…”<br/><br/>Felix the driver, a short wiry man with a wig that was a bit askew, clicked his tongue and grasped the reigns on a pair of grays nickering in annoyance.<br/><br/>Haidée thought about helping, but getting further into the mud would ruin her dress. And she doubted that the men would even allow her to even touch the coach at this point. Instead, she concentrated on the bit of mud stubbornly clinging to the coach wheels. Something seemed a little odd about its shade of brown; it didn’t match the rest of the soggy ground.<br/><br/>“Excuse me, Messieurs, but don’t you notice that there’s something strange about this whole situation?” she said aloud.<br/><br/>The fat man stopped for a moment to wipe his brow as the others continued working. The powder from his wig was mixing with his sweat making his florid face appear even splotchier. Maurice Ducos was a fellow vacationer who was going to meet up with some of his cronies on Mont Saint Filan for relaxation. Ducos wore an exquisitely tailored brown velvet coat that was now splattered with mud, but he didn’t appear to notice that as he nodded to her in a condescending matter. “Do not worry your pretty little head, Mademoiselle, we will get free before the tide comes in.”<br/><br/>“I wasn’t exactly worried about the tide.” Then she thought about the hat she was wearing. “And I don’t have a little head,” she said after a pause. The hat was another accessory that she had gotten in Paris—it was studded with brass buttons and trimmed in black satin that matched her slippers. There was even a large ostrich feather on top. The brim was long, shading most of her face.<br/><br/>The lean man snorted and glared in her direction, the late afternoon light glinting gold on his spectacles. He was the only man who wasn’t wearing a wig. Instead, his dark hair was tied back in a queue, but the autumn wind was rapidly tugging strands loose. “Only a fool wouldn’t be worried about the tide. Pay no attention to the Mademoiselle, Ducos. She’s drunk.”<br/><br/>Haidée couldn’t quite remember the lean man’s name. His last name was Renaud. His first name was far more vague. Jean? Jacques? Jean-Jacques? Who cared anyway? She didn’t like him the first time she set eyes on him at the inn back on the mainland. Something about him was off—although she couldn’t pinpoint exactly what it was. In comparison to Ducos, he was lean, but she had the impression that his overly large greatcoat was more of a deception. Renaud was one of those men of science—a follower of the intellectual movement. He was going to Mont Saint Filan to do some studies at its astronomical observatory which stood on a hill on the island.<br/><br/>Perhaps that was it—this was the first time that she had encountered a man whose brain primarily resided between his ears and not elsewhere.<br/><br/>“What I mean is that the mud is different here. It’s as if it’s deliberately trying to catch the wheels. And it’s ruining my shoes.”<br/><br/>“There are more important things than shoes,” Renaud replied. “I have a more practical suggestion. Why don’t we throw some of the trunks out to lighten the load? We’ll start with Mademoiselle Avenall’s things. Shoes and fancy dresses aren’t that necessary anyway.”<br/><br/>She crossed her arms. “Why don’t we throw your ego out first, Monsieur Renaud? I think it’s far heavier than my luggage.”<br/><br/>“Ha! Imagine that line coming from an actress.”<br/><br/>“Children!” Felix said repressively. The wiry man tried to frown reproachfully but he ended up looking like a comical gargoyle. “Now is not the time to bicker. Push a little more to the left and I’ll see if these equines will put in a bit more effort in getting the coach out of this muck.”<br/><br/>Haidée wanted to stamp her foot and call them all names for ignoring her. But the mud—darkening by the second, it seemed—warranted far more attention than an actress throwing a fit. So instead, she pressed her lips together to prevent herself from making another remark and began drawing on the ground with the heel of her slippers.<br/><br/>She swept her ankle around in a semi-circle and closed the arc before bisecting it with a line that pointed straight towards the mud covered coach wheels. She whispered into the air and the temperature suddenly plummeted. She wrapped her arms more tightly against herself as the dark patch of mud began to shrink and with a final push, the men rolled the coach out of the mud.<br/><br/>Her head began to throb.<br/><br/>“What did I tell you, Mademoiselle?” said Ducos triumphantly. “We got the coach out of that quicksand and we have plenty of time to spare before the tide comes in.”<br/><br/>“Not that much time,” Felix cut in. “I suggest you three get on now.”<br/><br/>She got on first as Ducos helped her into their conveyance. When the coach was in motion once again, she rubbed her temples, wishing for her supplies that she had stuffed in one of her trunks.<br/><br/>“Are you feeling well, Mademoiselle?” Ducos inquired.<br/><br/>Haidée shook her head lightly. “I just need a drink.”<br/><br/>Renaud’s lip curled in sardonic response to her remark. “Figures.”</p>

<p>Uncle Elliot’s cremation urn was still warm.<br/><br/>It weighed heavily in Zan’s gloved hands, glinting in the waning sunlight. Father Oberlin stood on the sand, the receding tide lapping at the tips of his boots. He held a small black book in his gnarled hands and he was reading from it. An elegy to Uncle Elliot’s life as a man of responsibility and genius.<br/><br/>Zan’s fingers curled as a breeze suddenly whipped up, tugging at her black veil, Father Oberlin’s silver hair, and the loose bits of clothing of the other funeral attendants. She barely paid any attention to the elegy or the waves on the beach or even the discrete rattling cough from those gathered. She focused in on the warmth in her hands, slowly leeching away and remembered a long ago winter day when her uncle had taken her hand for a walk in the park just outside the Museum. She had laughed, delighting in the steam that her breath had made in the cold air.<br/><br/>Just that morning, she had watched her uncle’s body go into the crematorium. While she had waited for the ashes, black smoke had curled out of the crematorium chimney. Her parents and now her uncle—laid to rest by fire.<br/><br/>She flexed her fingers again. They had been stiff in the morning and she had first thought that it was just the cold or nervousness. But then there had been the <em>hair</em> and her gloves felt more and more strange as the elegy wore on.<br/><br/><em>Oh God, no. Not now.</em><br/><br/>When she had been young, her uncle had had a devil of a time teaching her how to control the <em>change</em>. After all, he wasn’t what her father had been. And being not of her kind, Elliot’s teaching had been imperfect. Sometimes, when things were simply too much, her civilized mask slipped. This, his funeral, was exactly the kind of time her uncle would have demanded her to be strong. So she consciously <em>willed</em> herself together. And her hand that had wanted to become a paw became a hand again.<br/><br/>She furtively glanced around her. The Church’s emissary, Jebediah Southmore, in a fine black cloak, stood beside Father Oberlin with his white-flecked head bowed. Similarly, the rest of the mourners, from the irascible Pendergrast and the fidgety Del, had their eyes cast downward toward the sand. Only one man was turned towards her, longish black hair tousled by the wind and narrowed eyes studying as if he knew she had just been struggling with herself. Even with the protection of her veil, her gaze quickly flicked elsewhere. The only similarities between her and Caradon were the color of their hair and the shape of their eyes. Just because he had been Elliot’s patron—that he had been supplying the funds for her uncle’s work—didn’t mean that she had to like him.<br/><br/>Staring at the swirls and eddies that the sand and the seawater made beneath her feet, she slowly became aware that Father Oberlin had finally finished speaking. He nodded to her and reflexively she clutched the urn tighter to her chest.<br/><br/>“Miss Hu, it’s time to see him to rest.” It was Southmore. His clear blue eyes were sympathetic and kind. He was someone who wanted to help in her time of need, had even offered to help her make the arrangements even when she turned down the suggestion that her uncle be buried in one of the Old Amanthus cemeteries. But Elliot loved the sea and a plot of land was too expensive.<br/><br/>When he moved to touch her, she stepped back toward the sea. She didn’t want to let her uncle go—the only bulwark she had since childhood. And now, there was nothing.<br/><br/>The cold water washed over her boots. This was the moment that they expected her to spread the ashes—at the edge. Instead, she waded into the water until it was up to her knees. Her mourning dress rose in the surf like a mushroom. The sea tugged and involuntarily she took another step into the sea. Behind her, the others were shouting. Father Oberlin in his shrill, rheumy tenor. Southmore in a deeper, cajoling tone. Del and Sabina, angry and worried. And Mrs. Philomon in huffy panic.<br/><br/>The lid of the urn had a tiny handle of ivory embellished with violets. With thumb and forefinger, she delicately lifted it as she tilted the urn forward. Gray-silver ash streamed from the lip of the urn into the churning green-blue waters. The sea air swept her veil past her face and for a moment, she could see the setting sun clearly—a globe of red fire—and some of the ash flying into the wind.<br/><br/>Uncle Elliot glittered like stardust and then he was gone. Only the brine was left, stinging her nose as she breathed.</p>

<p>The lunch crowd at <em>The Black Bean</em> was large enough for most people to maintain their anonymity. Nonetheless, Mel Ang hid behind the business section of a newspaper that had been left by the previous occupant of her chair. Every few moments, she would peek from the edges of the paper to a point just beyond the salad bar and wince before disappearing back into the depths of black and white. A half eaten chicken sandwich, a tomato and avocado salad, and a glass of apple juice stood stoically untouched by her right hand.<br/><br/>“I didn’t know you had a sudden interest in the stock market.”<br/><br/>Mel slowly lowered the newspaper revealing a disapproving expression of sharp dark eyes and down-turned mouth which was somewhat spoiled by her black hair that had been braided into pig tails. A man, short dark hair—tousled and spiky—wire-framed spectacles, a white t-shirt that said “Tech Geek” plastered on a swimmer’s build, sat opposite of her. He grinned and took a bite out of his own sandwich. Mel mentally counted to three to prevent herself from rolling up the newspaper and bashing him on the head.<br/><br/>“Can’t you see I’m hiding?” Mel stabbed a fork into the salad. “Mad Dog is here.”<br/><br/>“Where?” He turned around to look, but Mel suddenly let go of the salad fork with a clang and grabbed the front of his shirt.<br/><br/>“Stuart. No. He’ll see you.”<br/><br/>He slumped back into his chair when she let go. “What’s the matter with you? He’s just our boss.”<br/><br/>Mad Dog, known as Ralph Bartlett in more professional circles, was the chief editor of the New Halis cultural magazine <em>Hot Tread</em>. As his nickname suggested, Mad Dog had a rather formidable and well-deserved reputation for being insanely tenacious.<br/><br/>“A boss that just got back from a vacation,” clarified Mel. “If I hear just one more time about his ecstatic tour to the middle of nowhere and his new found fondness for crab apple jelly, I’m going to scream.”<br/><br/>“Remind me to buy earplugs then,” Stuart replied.<br/><br/>She turned her nose up at him and with an audible rustle of papers, the shield was erected again.<br/><br/>But when she made another furtive peek, her lunch companion said blandly, “I trust you’re being entertained by the prices for ComTech shares?”<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“ComTech,” he repeated.<br/><br/>“For a reporter, you play way too many video games.”<br/><br/>“ComTech is a computer company, not a video game.”<br/><br/>“It’s all the same difference to me.”<br/><br/>“So! Roubere. Ang. This is where you two have been hiding on lunch break,” boomed a loud sonorous voice just above their heads.<br/><br/>Mel gave a small shriek and the newspaper slid to the floor.<br/><br/>A tall beefy man in biker leathers, a swirling dragon tattoo on his right bicep and scraggly blonde hair on his chin and head pulled up a chair at their table and plunked his lunch down. He shoved his sunglasses over his head revealing eyes as gray as the beads on the strange new necklace at his throat. “I have a great idea for the both of you. It came to me while I was standing in line to get lunch.”<br/><br/>“Oh, great,” said Mel.<br/><br/>“Are you sending us overseas?” Stuart asked hopefully. “I’ve always wanted to do a story on…”<br/><br/>“It’s even better than that,” Mad Dog replied. “It’s one of the towns I passed through during my vacation. Gavot. They have the greatest crab apple jelly.”<br/><br/>Mel made a strangled sound at the back of her throat.<br/><br/>The editor ignored the noise. “They also have this strange little harvest festival they hold every year. It was just too bad that I couldn’t stay there to see it. So I figured, why not send you two to cover it? And when you come back, you can tell me all about it. And we’ll get an article about it.”<br/><br/>“Why send the both of us?” Stuart frowned. “Isn’t it small enough for just one person to cover it?”<br/><br/>Mad Dog shook his head. “You know as well as I do that you and Mel work better as a te…”<br/><br/>The editor made a disturbing choking noise as his eyes rolled upward. His head jerked unnaturally. Stuart and Mel made startled exclamations and reached to help. Their hands simultaneously grabbed onto the necklace.<br/><br/>Mad Dog suddenly flailed into a seizure and flung the two away. They let go of the necklace too late and the string holding it together snapped. Gray beads popped and skittered and landed into Mad Dog’s untouched sandwich.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </p>

<p>Along the coastline, a grayed lighthouse rose as a lone outpost. A mist gathered obscuring the view. Verity wiped the fogging glass with the edge of her sleeve, but the old bus—line seventy-four, the daily connection from the southern, more inland suburbs—had already rumbled past. The heading was north on Avtandil Road, straight to the heart of Monteport.<br/><br/>Verity was alone on the bus aside from the driver, a portly and squinty eyed man lost in his own thoughts as he stared at the road ahead. Line seventy-four, from the schedules, always made a stop at the station in the center of Monteport at noon. She wiped the window again but saw only the line of the land and the sea.<br/><br/>There was a large mirror at the front of the bus where the driver was supposed to look up to check on his passengers. But since Verity was the only passenger, he never looked up. Verity looked though, and since she sat on the second row behind the driver’s seat, she had a view of a pale faced woman with short, badly cut hair. She touched the ends of those dark choppy locks that barely reached her chin. It had been worth it to raze the hair that had once draped down her back. He never appreciated it, and it would have been pointless to keep it.<br/><br/>In another instinctive gesture, she touched her wrists which were covered by bandages and turned to look back out the window.<br/><br/>From the land, strange shapes sprouted from the ground. She squinted and thought she could define them as the alternating squat and elongated blobs of buildings. These blobs grew larger and more distinct. These buildings passed by like old, worn out people with rusted railings and tattered shutters. Dribbles of snow clung to the eaves like perpetual dandruff.<br/><br/>The low grinding of the bus engine that had long since receded to the background was shut off and the sudden silence was as sharp as a bell.<br/><br/>“Monteport,” announced the driver.<br/><br/>Verity got up and felt her spine stretch and pull from sitting for too long. She buttoned her body length black coat and slung an old duffle bag over her shoulder. The first thing she saw as she stepped off the bus was the small transport terminal tucked in beside the city post office and a denuded tree with one crow sitting on the tip of a branch. The bird looked down at her and made not one sound.<br/><br/>She stepped away from the bus and felt the icy snow slip under her boots.<br/><br/>“Verity, over here!”<br/><br/>She looked to the right of her and saw a man, white-haired and intensely faced, dressed in a gray overcoat and black scarf. He was smiling. In response, she felt her own lips moving upward.<br/><br/>“Uncle Matthias. I thought I was going to meet you at the apartment.”<br/><br/>“Change of plans, my dear. I checked the schedules and thought, why not? Everything arrived as planned. I had most of your things moved into the rooms. What happened to your hair?”<br/><br/>“I cut it. It’s too much of a hassle to deal with long hair.”<br/><br/>Matthias slanted her a look but decided not to pursue the subject. “I’ll be leaving tomorrow. I’ll be leaving the car with you, though. Kind of awkward to have that shipped overseas, eh?”<br/><br/>“And what about your things?”<br/><br/>“I had them already packed and sent.”<br/><br/>Verity tucked her hands into her coat pocket as she followed her uncle across the city square which was framed by the main centers: the city hall to the south, the city library to the east, the local college to the west, and the great hulking monolith of cathedral to the north. Matthias’s small tan two-seater, soon to be hers, was parked in front of the library. As they neared the car, she could see that there was five minutes left on the parking meter.<br/><br/>“I feel like I’m kicking you out of your own house,” she said.<br/><br/>“Nonsense. I’m practically going away on a permanent vacation. It wouldn’t make sense to keep an apartment here if I wasn’t going to live in it. I think it’s good timing that you decided to take it off my hands when your new job took you here.”<br/><br/>“Yes, but still…” she trailed off as the sound of a low resonant bell broke the cold air. This sound for midday spewed from the bell tower of the cathedral.<br/><br/> </p>

<p>8:00 AM<br/><br/>“Pure crap. You’ve got to rewrite that.”<br/><br/>Reine glanced at the rear view mirror and saw that the passenger sprawled out on the back seat, a tall lanky man with choppily cut muddy hair, had his fingers to his lips as if he were sucking on a cigarette. His mouth pursed to blow imaginary smoke into the car. His eyes were closed.<br/><br/>“Your characters are hackneyed. Your plot recycled from your last book. Where’s your spark?”<br/><br/>“Is he always like this?” Reine asked Marcus who was sitting slouched in shotgun, furiously crossing out lines in a manuscript with red ink.<br/><br/>“Like what?”<br/><br/>“Talking in his sleep.”<br/><br/>He shrugged. “How should I know? Ask his girlfriend.”<br/><br/>“He has a new girlfriend every week.”<br/><br/>The gray truck in front of them turned right on an intersection. She floored the accelerator and the changing leaves lazily passing by became a blur of gold. Two hours before, Reine had met up with Marcus and Hadrian at the lobby of their place of employment, Ravenstone Publishing, to carpool. The three of them had been invited to Monadnock by Ira for a little house party.<br/><br/>The invitation had come three weeks earlier during a small birthday celebration for Reine. They were having lunch at the tiny bistro across the street from Ravenstone Publishing and Hadrian had unceremoniously whipped out a dainty pink envelope from the inner pocket of his crinkled leather jacket. It was a birthday card with flowers and animals and a hastily scrawled message in Hadrian’s unintelligible hand. After seeing the card, Marcus had scowled and shoved a small misshapen object wrapped in twine and brown paper. That had been a ghoulish gargoyle who wobbled his head whenever he moved. It was a dashboard ornament to add to Reine’s beloved collection. And Ira, the tiny snow-haired woman who first met them at a posh New York party back when they were young, naïve upstarts in the publishing industry, handed her a black velvet pouch with drawstrings that contained twenty-four tumbled quartz stones in all the colors of the rainbow.<br/><br/>“But I’m not twenty-four,” Reine had protested.<br/><br/>“It doesn’t matter,” Ira had replied. “They’ve been in my family for generations, but I’m giving it to you because you’ll probably find them more interesting. My family called them seeing stones. What you’re supposed to see, I have no idea. There were supposed to be twenty-five, but I think I lost one.”<br/><br/>“Why are they called seeing stones?” Hadrian had opened the bag and picked out a red stone to examine. “Are they like runes?”<br/><br/>“Runes are actual letters,” Marcus had explained. “Maybe these act as a scrying focus. Sort of like a crystal ball.”<br/><br/>Ira had waved a hand and said, “Well whatever it is, I’m just reminded that I wanted to invite the three of you to my house over for a week or two. An old-fashioned house party. It’s large and so there’s plenty of room. I’m also planning to have a few of my other friends there and I’m sure you’ll like all of them.”<br/><br/>Marcus yawned and stretched his long limbs. He was similar in build to Hadrian but was a little narrower in the shoulders and dark-haired. And where Hadrian was as pretty and as flighty as a movie star, Marcus was austere. His left cheek was marred by a scar that slashed downward. Fencing accident, he had once explained tersely.<br/><br/>“Why on earth didn’t Ira just get a penthouse in Manhattan?” He stuffed the rest of the manuscript in a manila folder and looked at the driver, a slight woman who had stuffed her long black hair underneath a baseball cap in a miserable attempt to look like one of the boys.<br/><br/>“I think she likes living the high life of a mystery author,” she replied. “That is, being mysterious. But I’ve got to admit that Monadnock is a bit extreme.”<br/><br/>“Out in the middle of nowhere,” Hadrian agreed in his sleep. “Your plot has to go somewhere you know.”<br/><br/>“Do you have a sock?” said Reine.<br/><br/>Marcus blinked. “Whatever for?”<br/><br/>“To stuff his mouth. This is a vacation, for Christ’s sake. I don’t want to hear about work even if he is only talking in his sleep.”<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </p>

<p>Once again, Adrian was leering down the secretary’s low necked blouse.<br/><br/>Simone sighed and ducked her head, letting the edge of her short black hair brush past her chin to shield her face. Really, especially more often of late, it seemed as if she was the brains driving the outfit of the whole business. Whereas he was busy pursuing other things that were more testosterone driven. Like pursuing Danny the secretary who probably had her body edited more times by a plastic surgeon then she had edited the paperwork that Dubois and Sung occassionally generated.<br/><br/>She quickly stepped into her office and shut the door. It was oak and no sound carried through it. She strode to the chair at her desk and sank into the chair. There was nothing like barking dogs at four am to disturb the sleep of any sane person. Simone considered herself rather average although on the short side; it was quite annoying though when she had to talk down to Adrian, he was at least a head and a half taller than she. Her eyes were warm brown cognac, tilted slightly in an asian slant which she thought quite frequently gave her a disadvantage. People tended to defer to Adrian although she was a full partner. She tapped a pen idly and opened a manila folder. Bland government paperwork. She stared for a moment out the window.<br/><br/>The view was from the second story of a recently restored building. In fact, the whole neighborhood had been recently restored. Many new businesses had moved into the area in the past year causing the area of Elanne to experience growth in the sector. Most of the buildings were red bricked and white trimmed blanketing the whole area in a colonial feel. Across the street on the second floor was an accounting firm. Below it, a flourist. She absently wondered when Danny would see a dozen roses from Adrian. Perhaps when he tired of her. There was just something about surgically altered barbie blondes that made her think of the word ‘disposable’.<br/><br/>The phone rang, jarring her from her reverie. Grabbing the reciever, she said, “Yes?”<br/><br/>“Ms. Sung? Your mother is on line one.” Danny’s bubbly voice rang out hitting a few of the shrill frequencies. Simone winced, her sleep-aching mind ringing.<br/><br/>“What? Oh fine, I’ll talk to her.” She jabbed a button to cut any extraneous remark the secretary might have deemed necessary to insert. “Mom?”<br/><br/>There seemed to be a flurry of Chinese before her mother’s girlish voice came through clearly. “Simone? You’re finally at work? I’ve been trying to reach you all day.”<br/><br/>She frowned. “You know I don’t get to work until ten.”<br/><br/>“Your sister gets to work at seven-thirty. Every morning.”<br/><br/>She hated being compared to her sister Evelyne. Never good enough. She should have become a famous painter or an archetict. She should have married a doctor or lawyer and produced a couple of kids. Should have, should have, should have. She was sick of it. She was a private investigator, but that wasn’t good enough. It didn’t have the same ring as professional chess master.<br/><br/>“For Christ’s sake, Mom, I own a business. I set my own hours.”<br/><br/>Her mother made some sort of sound that resembled the croaking of a frog and the belching of a hippo. “Actually, I wanted to confirm that you’ll be coming to the party this Saturday.”<br/><br/>“Of course I’m coming. I’m not going to miss Caroline’s birthday.” Caroline was Evelyne’s second child. Simone hated parties, but that was a petty excuse for neglecting one’s niece.<br/><br/>“Is Adrian coming?”<br/><br/>“I haven’t asked him. Most likely he will if we don’t have a case then.”<br/><br/>“Good.”<br/><br/>That sounded suspicious. “What are you up to this time, Mom?”<br/><br/>“Caroline is fond of Adrian.”<br/><br/>“Yeah. It’s kind of strange. Adrian is usually doesn’t think much of children.”<br/><br/>“Huh. Look, dress nicely will you? No jeans. I’m also inviting some friends of mine...”<br/><br/>Simone mentally groaned. Her mother was trying to set her up. Again. “It won’t work.”<br/><br/>“What do you mean?”<br/><br/>“You know exactly what I mean.”<br/><br/>“But.”<br/><br/>“Good-bye Mom. I believe I have an appointment I have to see,” she lied.<br/><br/>“All right.”<br/><br/>She placed the reciever back with a little more force than necessary and immediately rubbed her temples. This day was not working.<br/><br/>That morning, she awoke to the thin shrieking howls of a couple of neighborhood dogs who had suddenly developed a hankering for a walk outside. And it had kept her up for the rest of the time. She had lain in her bed for a few more hours before becoming fed up and later had attempted to go on her day. The strange thing was, it was not the dog howling itself that had kept her awake. It was the lack of her usual dreams. Instead of the nightmarish flicker of swords, pain, and blood, her unconscious mind was treated to an innocuous conversation with owner of the deli down the street. Perhaps she was suffering from some sort of depression or withdrawal from her deprivation of the daily dose of violence.<br/><br/>She glanced again at the forms in the folder and quickly filled it out. Bueraucratic work was a mind numbing drug. Time seemed to fly away and when she looked at her watch, she found that it was already a couple minutes past noon. She stretched her legs under the table and kicked off her shoes before standing up to stare out the window. The accounting firm had their blinds drawn. The whole office was probably out to lunch. Her stomach suddenly protested and reluctantly, she turned away from the view to put her shoes back on.<br/><br/>Out in the reception area, it was empty except for Danny who was slurping a chocolate slim-fast shake.<br/><br/>“Is that all you have for lunch?” Simone had once asked her.<br/><br/>“And a protein bar.”<br/><br/>“That’s hardly enough for a bird.”<br/><br/>Danny had laughed. “Well, look who’s talking. Not everyone is like you. We can’t just eat whatever we like and keep our figure.”<br/><br/>What about plastic surgery? She had mentally sneered. Danny was a walking dream for plastic surgeons. Gifts from rich ex-boyfriends, no doubt. Instead she had said, “But I’m not tall like you. I’m short. Very short.”<br/><br/>“Petite. But don’t worry about me, Ms. Sung. This is more than enough to fill me.” Simone just shook her head. If people insisted on abusing themselves, who was she to stop them? Perhaps after all this time, she had become dull, desensitized, uncaring. A gray blot on an otherwise colored world.<br/><br/>“Danny, I’m going to Willard’s. Do you want me to get you anything?”<br/><br/>The secretary waved an absent minded hand that was crowned with bright red nails. Her puffy frosted blonde head bobbed a little. Her eyes were glued to the computer, no doubt surfing some rather cheesy singles sites. “That’s all right, Ms. Sung. You just go on ahead.”<br/><br/>She slightly shrugged. “Okay. I’ll be back in an hour.”<br/><br/>The secretary nodded again.<br/><br/>Simone turned and tugged at the handle to the door out of the office. Behind her, she heard a door slam.<br/><br/>“Wait a sec. You are going to Willard’s?”<br/><br/>She turned her head a little to see Adrian stroll towards her. He was wearing his jacket and his tie was still neatly in place around his neck. A record, if she ever saw one. Usually before an hour passed at work and his jacket would be slung over a chair, the collar unbuttoned, and the sleeves rolled up. What was the occassion? He had longish dark hair which he tied back at the nape of his neck. Dark free strands caressed his forehead. There was a strange bright glint in his gray eyes. Simone narrowed her own eyes in response.<br/><br/>“What do you mean? What’s going on here?”<br/><br/>His eyes briefly flickered to Danny who did not seem to be paying them any attention. “You are going to Willard’s?” he repeated.<br/><br/>She took the hint. “Yeah,” she replied. She turned to walk out the door, without bothering to see if he was following.</p>

<p>Foreword<br/><br/>These are the chronicles of the times we’ve lived and the understanding we all had of who we are and what we need to do and the worlds within and without.  <br/>There is always light and there is always dark.  Finding our place and saving the world was our journey.<br/><br/>“The Copper Knight”<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>Chapter One: It’s Beginning<br/><br/>	The wood paneled sitting room was beautiful and elegant.  The wood polished over the years to a patina only age and care can give it.  Two large leather armchairs, the color of deep black coffee, sat side by side in front of a large stone fireplace.  The fire was roaring.  And that was the problem.  The room would be a joy to be in if it weren’t suffocatingly hot.	<br/>	A man entered the room.  He was tall, about six feet, with stunning green eyes and salt and pepper hair.  Trim, perfectly groomed and wearing an expensive suit, he looked like he could be a senator or the CEO of some large corporation.  <br/>	“I have the house plan.”  He said, his voice deep and resonant.<br/>	From the back of one of the armchairs, an aged woman’s hand placed a delicate teacup on the small round table between the chairs.  The hand was old.  Very old.  Thin, with knotted knuckles and blue veins protruding.  The hand had long pointed fingernails, painted a deathly deep maroon red.  These are frightening hands.  Hands that have controlled much and will continue to do so.  The index finger pointed at the house plan, as the man sat down in the other chair.<br/>	“Here.  We will return.  Here is where it will begin.”  The voice was thin and aged but forceful nonetheless.<br/>	The man looked at the woman with respect.  She was in her nineties.  This woman had green eyes, like the man’s, only much paler as if time had washed out much of the color.  She was frail, but projected a sense of strength.  Paradoxically, she sat in this incredibly warm room covered with a brown mink coverlet.<br/>	“Let me see the layout,” she said in a determined tone.  The man unfolded what looked like to be an old blueprint of a building, and laid the paper on the old woman’s lap.  She spread her hands over the aged paper, carefully ironing out the folds.  She looked.  The man waited.<br/>	“Here.  This is my room,” she said as her long thin index finger tapped the drawing. “ It will be good to return to it.  I have certainly missed it all these years.” The man nodded, taking note.<br/>	“And this room will be converted for the others.  I want them together when we begin.”  The man nodded again, and rose to leave, leaning over to reclaim the house plan.<br/>	The old woman placed her hand on his arm, causing him to pause. “There is a strong force there.”  She stared into his eyes.  “Do not think this will be easy.  We have prepared but there are those who will attempt to stop us.  This time, we must prevail.”<br/>	“I understand,” said the man, respectfully.  “I will alert the watchers and the knights.  The force will awaken and we will be ready.”<br/>	“Tomorrow then?”<br/>	“Yes, we leave tomorrow.”<br/>	“Good.  Now I must rest.”  The old woman closed her eyes. The man folded up the house plan and left the room.  As the massive library door closed behind him, the old woman’s lips moved as if in prayer.  “My love, your day will be at hand.  I will deliver a great victory to you.”  Then she smiled.<br/><br/>Chapter Two:  Perry Lake<br/><br/>     Margaret (Meg) Everson Riccio, long and lanky at 15 years of age, was lying on one of the few flat rocks on the shore of Perry Lake in Franklin, Montana, soaking up the warm rays of the late August sun in the cooling hours of the afternoon.<br/>     A gazillion years ago (well, not really but many thousands), glaciers pushed through this valley in Montana and in this little area, left a beautiful body of water, clear and blue, surrounded by boulders and pine trees.  Over the centuries,  “Man” encouraged the lake to be wider and deeper, so it could be a reservoir for the melting snow of spring.  <br/>     This Montana valley, the Starfruit Valley, always needs water.  The winters are harsh and folks around here pray for lots of snow and then a mild spring that would gently melt it and deposit it into various spots, like Perry Lake.  Some years, their hopes were dashed with a paucity of snow in winter and excruciating heat in summer, causing wildfires that could destroy acres on acres of land, leaving people stranded and homeless, and ranchers looking at the bank reclaiming their land.  Or just as bad, there would be tons of snow and then a quick hot spring, and the land was flooded, with equally devastating results.<br/>     Meg wasn’t thinking about the water supply to the Starfruit Valley though.  She was thinking about returning to Franklin High School for her sophomore year after this Labor Day weekend.  She felt happy.  Eager, in fact, to get back to school this September.  Home life was tough right now.  Her parents separated during the summer, and every day, it seemed surer that they were not going to come back together.  She hated the idea of them divorcing.  Hell, what kid wants their parents to split up?  But they are not even my real parents, Meg thought guiltily.  She never thought of them as anything but her real parents even though she was part African-American, Native American and White, and her mom, Camryn Everson was about as Waspy-white as possible, and her dad, Eddie Riccio, described himself as a “good old Dago” (slang for Italian) who “escaped Upstate New York”.  <br/>     Meg was adopted through Montana’s Catholic Social Services at birth.  She never met her birth mom, or birth dad for that matter.  But her parents promised that when she was eighteen, they would help her find her birth parents so she could get to know them.  From time to time, Meg would wonder about them, but she never, never, ever thought of them as her real parents.  Cam and Eddie were her real parents.  At least up until they told Meg that they were splitting up.  And then suddenly, Meg had the thought: “Well, they are not my real parents.”  Of course she knew perfectly well that her real parents weren’t together.  In fact, she knew that at the time of her birth, they weren’t even in a real relationship, which is why they gave her up for adoption to begin with.  <br/>     Sometimes, thinking of Cam and Eddie as being somewhat removed from her made the pain of their split a little less palpable for Meg.  Like she was just another friend in their lives.  Someone who could watch sympathetically from the outside.  Of course, that was not really possible.   Meg loved them so much.  Why couldn’t adults figure things out better?  Meg was aware that her dad was a dreamer and a bit irresponsible sometimes.   An outdoorsman who also wrote poetry and novels, though he got paid only for guiding river trips and all his novels and poetry sat in a trunk at the foot of their bed.  Likewise, Meg adored her capable but tiny mother, and was amazed at her ability to be a Forest Service biologist and handle the wilderness, but it was also true that her mom was just a little too much of a rational linear thinker and well, a control freak to boot.  She even charted the meals they ate to make sure everyone was getting the right nutrition.  No kid wants to know that the mac ‘n cheese they are eating is actually good for them!  Forget calcium and protein; kids just want it to taste good.  Her dad would just laugh at Cam and give Meg a sly wink.  Meg loved that.  Sometimes ganging up on her mom, while at other times, enjoying busting her dad for his lack of practicality.  Meg thought they were a perfect couple, and indeed they were for the past twenty years, but now, Cam and Eddie were going to call it quits.  Impossible to imagine.  They were so perfect together.  Even looked perfect together.  Like a pair of salt and peppershakers.  Cam with her flowing, straight blond hair and blue eyes, and petite build, and Eddie, tall and meaty, with thick dark curly hair and big brown “moo” eyes.  That’s what Cam called them, “moo” eyes because they were big and dark and soulful like a cow.  “If you ever want to stay angry with your dad, don’t look in his eyes,” Cam would tell her daughter.  “Those eyes will melt your anger right away!  So don’t look…he’s got magic in those ‘moo’ eyes.”  Thinking about that made Meg smile, only to once again feel the pain of the current situation.<br/>      “Hell’s bells!  Did you see Grady in town?  What the heck was he doing wearing his pants like he’s some sort of rap gangsta?”  Riley Weathers certified wild woman and one of Meg’s two best friends, plopped down on the rock, slicing through Meg’s thoughts.<br/>      “What?”  Meg was annoyed, but looking at Riley’s smiling, animated, chubby Irish face with the ubiquitous knit cap pulled low on her forehead covering her eyebrows always made Meg giggle.  Riley always wore a knit cap: rain or shine, hot or cold.  Even in the dead heat of summer, Riley wore a knit cap, albeit a cotton one.  Riley believed it made her face look better, less chubby.  Unlike Meg’s puffy deep brown mixed race hair, Riley’s was dirty blond, thin, pin straight and stuck flat against her head.  Riley hated her “pear” head as she called it.  So the knit cap evened out the top part and Riley was convinced, made her face more oval and thus, more appealing.  Meg didn’t think so, but knew better than to argue beauty things with Riley.  Riley was always very certain about what looked good or not, even though fashion knowledge was not exactly an area of great expertise for kids in Montana.<br/>      “I saw Grady.  In town.  Walking around like this!”  Riley jumped up and pulled her sweat pants way down on her butt…almost off, and was swaggering around like she was from the “hood”.  <br/>       “Where did you see Grady?”<br/>      “Outside Hilton’s Hardware.  And this is the best part.”  Riley paused for dramatic effect.  “He was with Gracie Daggett.”  Riley whispered this delicious piece of gossip with gusto and sat down on the rock close to Meg, who bolted straight up. <br/>     “No way!  Gracie? Are you sure?”  Sometimes Riley’s imagination put two and two together and got fourteen, Meg thought.<br/>      “Yes, Meg.  I’m sure.  Grady was prancing around with his pants almost off his butt and, get this, Gracie came out of Hilton’s Hardware and she came up to Grady who KISSED her and took her hand and they walked off down the street.  I’m tellin’ you, that girl’s going to be dead when she gets home.”<br/>     “Yeah.  I know.” Meg considered the repercussions of this budding romance. This certainly is hot news.  Grady Finnegan was one of the cutest boys in school, and also, the one most likely to be expelled before the end of high school.  Pranks mostly, but he was every mom’s nightmare pick for their daughter.  Meg also counted Grady as the other of her two best friends. <br/>     Meg was one of the few people who understood Grady, having grown up together on nearby ranches.  They were literally born three days apart.  Grady first, then, Meg, a fact Grady never let Meg forget.  For all intents and purposes, Meg considered Grady her brother.<br/>     From the very beginning, Meg and Grady shared a special bond and everyone in town knew they were best buds, even though many were puzzled by that attachment.  Grady was a small boy, lean and slight, and always seemed to need to prove his toughness to the other kids.  Even in preschool, his desire to physically prove himself earned him a reputation for being a bully.  Meg understood that it was only his insecurity.  Of course, when she was little, she couldn’t articulate that thought.  From the time they were toddlers, it just seemed that Meg knew how to handle Grady, and sometimes that meant coming down hard on him.  <br/>     In fact, there was this famous Meg/Grady story that Meg’s mom and Mike, Grady’s dad liked to tell.  Seems that one afternoon after a cool rain, the kids were playing out in the yard.  They were about five years old at the time.  Mike and Cam were hanging and talking and watching the kids, when suddenly Grady punched Meg right in the face and took off running across the lawn.  Without a beat, Meg, who was noticeably taller and bigger than Grady, charged after him, throwing herself into the air and tackling him to the wet, puddle-riddled ground.  She pushed his face into the mud, flipped Grady over, straddled his chest and said: “Grady, I love you but if you ever punch me again, I’ll really beat you up!”  Then, Meg let Grady up and using the sleeve of her coat, helped clean the mud off his face and gave him a kiss on the cheek.  The two went off to continue playing, while Cam and Mike watched stunned.  In that one interaction, the bond and dynamics of their relationship was born and now almost ten years later, that relationship was the same.  Close, powerful and respectful.  Grady trusted Meg.  He never doubted her friendship or love, which was maybe the one thing that saved Grady from really losing his way.  And now this.  Grady hitting on Gracie Daggett was sure to bring more trouble than it was worth for a little nookie.  Meg felt a pang of dread for her friend.  She could only feel that he was heading for trouble with this new romance, and yet, there was nothing she could, or would say to him.  Why is it, Grady, that you are always looking to make your life hard?<br/>     Gracie Daggett came from one of the most fundamentally religious families in town.  Her dad, Christian, was the pastor of the Fundamental Christian God Church.  The fact that Gracie was hanging in the company of Grady Finnegan was shocking. And the idea that Gracie Daggett was succumbing to his charms....<br/>     Riley smiled.  “Pastor Daggett will have a fit.  Gracie will be in church for the rest of her life.”  Meg wished she could enjoy this juicy piece of gossip, and relish, like Riley, the picture of an upset Pastor Daggett.   The Pastor surely irritated Meg.   Gracie irritated Meg.  In fact, the whole Daggett family irritated her with their “holier than thou” Christian attitude, which she found extremely hypocritical.  After all, every one knew that Pastor Christian Daggett was little more than a drunk, who romanced his parishioners, especially the older ladies, so they would increase their church tithes.  Meg had difficulty with having a “religious” life because she could never abide the hypocrisy of the faithful.  Holy in church, and then curses the driver who pulls out in front of them when leaving the church parking lot.<br/>     Meg had to admit, however, that she felt sorry for Mrs. Daggett on occasion.  Mrs. Daggett was actually the one person Meg knew that actually appeared to try and be a good Christian woman.  It would never be Meg’s style, but she admired Mrs. Daggett's devotion to Jesus, even if that meant having to put up with a blowhard husband.   Meg knew that Mrs. Daggett would consider it a personal failing, maybe even a sin, if her daughter was falling for a boy like Grady Finnegan.  She would be unable to see the worth in a kid like Grady, Meg thought.  And the rest of the Daggett clan?  Well, hypocritical religious folk are unable to see the worth in anybody who doesn’t agree with them.  <br/>     Yep, Gracie with Grady…now that was gonna cause a stir.   Meg couldn’t help but wonder.  Could it be that Gracie was actually hanging out with Grady just to drive her parents crazy?  <br/>     As if on cue, Meg could hear Grady’s motorbike coming up the Forest Service road.   Riley jumped up to greet him.  Grady buzzed into the clearing next to the lake with Deshawn Walker sitting behind him.  “My dad’s on his way up here with all the food and stuff”, Deshawn called out as he hopped off the bike, while Grady set up the kickstand and rested his beloved treasure, the wheels that allowed him some freedom.  Dashawn Walker was the “other” African-American kid in Meg’s class.  However, Dashawn was from an African-American family, who moved here from Detroit when his dad, Trey, got the job on faculty at the University.  There were three kids, Dashawn also starting sophomore year in high school, a younger sister, Annette (aka Nae Nae), who was going into 8th grade and another brother, Akim, entering 5th grade.  They were officially the source for all things of Black culture, hip ness, and coolness.  <br/>     Meg, like all her buddies, turned to Dashawn for advice and guidance on the hippest of hip culture information.  She also clung to her friendship with Dashawn to at least feel like she was imbibing in her racial identity.  Dashawn was cool about it, talking about his life in Detroit, telling her what it was like to be in an all Black environment, though he never stopped kidding her that the only thing she knew about being African-American came from reruns of “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air” and some shows on Nickelodeon.  And that was true!<br/>     “Okay, dudes, my dad’s picking up Devon on the way.” Dashawn had the biggest smile known to man. A smile that Riley loved but Dashawn never seemed to notice.<br/>     “Cool,” said Riley.  “Is your dad sticking around?”  That was the all-important question.  Would they get to be on their own or under the watchful eye of a parent?<br/>     “Yeah, Dad’s hanging.  But he said he was going to drop off the food and then go for a drive and then come back,” Dashawn said with that famous grin.<br/>     Booyah!  Trey Walker was such a cool dad.  He knew we needed a bit of alone chill time to sit around and eat and well, do nothing really.  Meg and Riley exchanged smiles.<br/>     These were good kids.  Friends.  Innocent, in a teenage rebellious kind of way.  No drugs.  Not even booze.  They just wanted to hang and let loose and goof and…<br/>     Gracie Daggett arrived in a car driven by Melody Bates.  Meg and Riley looked at each other and rolled their eyes.  Here was a situation developing.  First off, what the heck was Gracie doing with Melody to begin with?  They didn’t hang in the same circles at all.  <br/>     Melody was well, one of the fast girls.  And up until today’s news flash, Gracie was one of the well, not fast girls.  Melody parked the car and Gracie jumped out.  She went directly over to Grady who cradled her in his arms, giving her a kiss.  Teen love?  Yikes, thought Meg as Riley poked her in the ribs.  Meanwhile, Melody emerged from her car like one hot mama.  Short, tight pencil skirt, patterned tights, and high heels.  Who wore high heels when they were coming to the lake?  <br/>     Meg was positively dumfounded.  She looked over to Riley, who had this weird “Joker” grin plastered on her face.  “Why’s she here?”, whispered Meg to Riley.<br/>     “Thanks for the invite, Riles.  Lookin’ forward to a little fun”, Melody chirped as she walked over to Dashawn and Grady, whose arms were still wrapped around Gracie.<br/>     “What did you do?  You invited Melody?” hissed Meg.  Riley looked sheepish.<br/>     “Um, well, um, saw her in town, you know, when I saw Grady and Gracie, and we kinda looked at each other and smiled and I said ‘hi’ and we started talking…” Riley knew Meg was angry.<br/>     Meg grabbed Riley by the arm and pulled her away from the rest of the kids. “And you actually believe that she wanted to chat with you and be friends with you?”  Riley looked down at her bare feet, toes wiggling on the rock.  “Riley, how many times do I have to tell you, we will NEVER fit in with Melody and her crowd?  They think we’re geeks.  All they care about is our friends who are boys liking them.”  Meg hit the “boys” really really hard.  “They still don’t understand why Grady, Devon and Deshawn hang with us at all.  Just let one infiltrate our group….one, like Melody, and we are goners.” <br/>     But the unanswered question, Meg pondered, is how did Melody, the town sexy girl, and Gracie, the town goodie-goodie girl, become pals …at least enough to have arrived at this party together?  The social status quo was quickly changing it seemed.  <br/>     Last year, their freshman year in high school brought about big changes, uneasy changes. Meg had noticed that suddenly, guys you went to preschool with, and used to hang around stark naked with, were now looking at you differently. “Budding sexuality”, Meg’s mom called it.  Well, it changed everything and Meg didn’t like it.  Even Grady betrayed her.  Once, that is.  <br/>     Last spring as she was walking down the hall to her next class, Grady came up from behind and cupped her breast in front of a bunch of his pals.  He laughed, said, “Nice development, Meg” and scurried off.  Meg was furious.  He was like her brother and here he was copping a feel?  Ick.  Angry and grossed out, she said nothing to Grady in front of his friends.  Although she was mad, she didn’t want to embarrass him, knowing how sensitive he would be to public humiliation, but that afternoon on the bus ride home, she made sure to sit next to him.  She whispered in his ear, “Not cool what you did today, Grady.”  “What?”, he put on his best innocent face.  She pointed to her breast, “Not cool.  And the next time you do something like that you’ll lose your hand, pal, you understand?”  She glared at him.  At first it seemed like Grady was going to pretend he didn’t know what Meg was talking about.  But Meg’s gaze was so fierce and intense that he knew a pretense at confusion would only send her into a rage.  “Promise, Megger, never again”, said Grady.  But his smile made Meg feel unconvinced.<br/>     And in all fairness, Meg felt herself seeing boys in a different way as well.  One boy in particular, Devon Lucas, who was soon to be coming up to the lake with Dashawn’s dad to celebrate the end of summer.  Devon Lucas.  Meg went to kindergarten with Devon.  They got along well, nothing special.  But then last year, Meg couldn’t quite put her finger on it, but things had changed between them.  Could it be that Devon’s eyes simply got more deeply blue against his coal-black hair and pale skin?  Could it be that Devon’s sudden growth spurt made him appear manlier to Meg?  Could it be because he had developed an interest in literature and photography, the two subjects Meg loved the most?  Could it be all those things and more?  Yes, things were different in the way Meg felt about Devon.  Where she could find it easy to envelope Dashawn in a bear hug or horse around with Grady, touching Devon seemed awkward and exciting at the same time.  She found herself wanting to look at him, but now felt very self-conscious about that desire.  <br/>     Did Devon know her secret attraction to him?  Meg couldn’t tell.  For the most part, Devon seemed like the same old Devon.  Funny, athletic, sensitive, nice.  Yep, the same ‘ole Devon who was now also tall, well built and incredibly handsome.  She pushed that thought away.  She was afraid of even admitting to herself her attraction for the boy who was once just a pal.  If he knew, maybe he wouldn’t want to be friends anymore.  Would feel uncomfortable?  Meg wasn’t used to having anxious thoughts about her friends.  But this attraction was certainly introducing her to a new level of worry.<br/>     The truck driven by Dashawn’s dad was coming up the road.  Trey was driving with Devon in the front seat, and in between them, Dashawn’s sister, Annette.  Now the plan was clear.  Trey would leave them alone but also leave Nae Nae there, knowing full well the kids would never do anything “off” when Dashawn’s little 13-year-old sister was hanging around.  First, because it would not be right.  Second, and more importantly, because Nae Nae would tell on them without a second’s hesitation.  Meg smiled to herself.  Trey Walker was one clever dude.<br/>     Devon was the first out of the truck.  He exploded out of the truck, Meg noted.  Devon did little without infusing it with tremendous energy.  He was inordinately graceful for a young man of fifteen who was nearly six feet tall.  He seemed to have totally missed the gangly period most boys go through.  But that wasn’t the striking feature of Devon.  It was the combination of his jet-black hair and sharp, deep blue eyes.  Killer combination for anyone who looked at him.  Uniquely, Devon seemed unaware of his looks and their effect on those with whom he came in contact.  To his friends, he was their pal; someone who loved sports (especially basketball; he was an excellent ball handler) and seemed at ease with all sorts of people.  He was, in a word, popular.  Yet, Devon never used his high social status for power or personal gain.  Instead, he was a “uniter”, making it okay for the “cool” kids to hang with the “less cool” and the downright “geeky”.  That is what made Devon so special and a leader.<br/>     “Hey, Meggers, give me a hand with this stuff, eh?” Devon’s voice, directed at Meg, just simply shot a thrill straight through her.  “You too, Nae Nae.”<br/>     “Coming”, Meg said at full sprint.   Devon began unloading the back of the truck.  Firewood, hamburger meat, hot dogs, buns for both, potato salad, chips and salsa, soft drinks and the requisite bonfire dessert makings for s’mores: marshmallows, chocolate and graham crackers.  Meg, Devon and Nae Nae industriously brought the supplies to the delineated fire pit by the lake.  Trey unloaded the rest of the stuff: napkins, plates, blankets, quickly kissed Nae Nae and drove off.<br/>     Grady started setting up the food with Gracie as his assistant. The way they talked with each other, the body language, very intimate and romantic, as they opened the chips and salsa.  At times, Grady and Gracie were whispering almost cheek to cheek.  Cooing, thought Meg, before turning her attention to the others.<br/>     Melody was clearly making a play for Dashawn, who was clearly not resisting.  Riley was watching Dashawn and Meg’s heart felt the pang of Riley’s heartbreak.  She would feel the same if Melody had been sidling up to Devon!  Damn, Melody!  Meg was not able yet to ascribe the proper responsibility to Riley herself for inviting Melody.  Instead, Meg directed her rancor at the short-skirted femme fatale.<br/>     “Hey, Melody, how about giving us a hand making the fire?”  A perfect job for someone in a tight skirt and heels, thought Meg with a not-so-subtle enjoyment of the sarcastic.  Dashawn jumped in.  “I’ll help you, Meg.  Melody’s not really dressed for carrying wood.”  He laughed. Melody smirked.  And Meg fumed.  <br/>     “I’ll help.” Nae Nae was thrilled to be a part of this.<br/>     Riley, desperate to not be left out of the loop, piped up, “Yeah, Meg, I’ll help too!”  And practically ran to get the firewood.  She carried a bunch of logs and dumped them into the pit, nearly knocking Meg over.  Meg looked up into the face of her friend, clearly in pain.  Meg was furious with Riley for causing this situation.   Why did you invite her, Riley?  But Meg said nothing.  Now wasn’t the time.  She simply had to help her pal through what was surely going to be a painful end-of-summer party.   Dashawn deposited his firewood supplies now and he and Melody were setting up the food that would be cooked.  If Nae Nae was suspicious of her brother’s cooking partner, she never let on.  But Meg couldn’t help wondering if her dad wouldn’t get an earful and if Dashawn was setting himself up for some heavy duty kidding.  Meg smiled at the thought, but then was cut short when she looked down at Riley.<br/>     Riley’s body was slumped over the fire pit as she began to build the fire.  It looked almost collapsed.  Meg knelt next to her.  Out of the corner of her eye, she could see a few small tears, like tiny pearls, rolling down Riley’s cheeks.  Weeping, not crying.  Weeping is much worse, thought Meg.  She put her arm around her friend, who simply subtly moved away.  Meg understood.  Riley was in full swing, blaming herself for creating this situation.  Meg’s heart ached for her friend.  Devon approached.  “Need any help, girls?”  Meg, of course, wanted to say yes.  She wanted Devon to kneel down next to her and help build the fire.  She wanted the enjoyment of them lighting it together, struggling to get the kindling to ignite, enjoying perhaps blowing on the tiny flames to encourage them, but with her friend in pain?  “No thanks, Devon.  Riley and I have it covered.”  Meg said as happily as she could muster.<br/>     Devon and Nae Nae moved over now with the others, talking as they continued setting up the table. Riley and Meg silently built and lit the fire, which thankfully ignited quickly.  It was only a few minutes before they would put on the burgers and hot dogs.  <br/>     Riley and Meg joined the others on the rocks, and popped open sodas.  The sun was setting over the lake.  It was beautiful.  <br/>     The talk was the usual topics that teenage Montana kids talk about.  What they did recently and over the summer, what funny things had happened, what weird things had happened, what stupid stuff there parents did, and wanted them to do, what was the latest gossip, and then the talk turned to the current hot news.  <br/>     “So the Niedermier Ranch sold, I heard”, said Dashawn.  The others gathered closer.<br/>     “It’s been for sale for awhile,” said Grady.  “Did someone buy the whole thing?”<br/>     “That’s what my Dad said,” Dashawn answered.<br/>     They all were surprised.  The Niedermier Ranch was over 3,500 acres and one of the oldest ranches in the Starfruit Valley.  That added up to a lot of money.  Although parts were beautiful and bordered on the Starfruit River, most of the acreage was really only good for grazing.  Cattle traditionally had been raised on the ranch.  But the Niedermeirs weren’t really cattlemen.  In fact, the Niedermeirs were a strange bunch.  Their history extended back generations in the valley but much of it of dubious ethical quality.  It was said that in the early part of the 19th century, Thaddeus Niedermier persuaded local Montana politicians to declare certain land areas that were to be used for parks and wilderness to be simply public instead.  Changing this designation opened up the possibility that someone (in this case Thaddeus) could stake a mining claim (which he did) and begin extracting ore and melting it for silver and gold.  Thaddeus got lucky to boot.  Just as he was mining the land for silver, the need for copper for wiring exploded and Thaddeus made more money from the copper than the other minerals.<br/>     What made Thaddeus so rich, however, was not his mine, but rather his ability to ignite fierce animosity between the copper barons, while hiding himself in the shadows.  While history remembers the great “Copper Kings”, history does not remember the wheeler-dealer who created their way, Thaddeus Niedermier.  Instead, Thaddeus amassed his fortune and silently moved out of Butte and bought the largest piece of land possible in the Starfruit Valley.  But Thaddeus did not live happily ever after.  In fact, most Montanans, like Meg and her friends, knew all about the tragedies of the Niedermeier family, thanks to their freshman high school English teacher, Garrett Maguire, who regaled them with the spooky stories of the tragic end of the Niedermeir family.  Murder, suicide, illness, ghosts.  The Niedermeir legends were fascinating and Mr. Maguire used them for maximum effect and a way to urge his students to read, learn and write.  Even the most recalcitrant learner, like Grady, could be found in the old history stacks at the library combing through the old microfiche of period newspapers searching for the grim details of one Niedermier tragedy or another.<br/>     And finally, the tragedies added up to not a Niedermier left in Montana.  The last of the heirs leased the land in parcels to cattlemen, rented the stately mansion to the Carters who adapted it to be a hotel/bed and breakfast kind of place, and took off for parts unknown, never to be heard of again.  The Carters ran the “Niedermier Ranch” for a decade but age and burnout made them decide not to renew their lease three years ago.  At that point, the heirs put the ranch, complete with the land, up for sale.  Certainly there were many local offers for parcels of land, but the offers weren’t very good and the heirs wanted to hold out, in hopes the economic climate would improve.  There had been a bit of a land boom in the late 1990s when Californians, flush with real estate cash, started buying up land in Western Montana, but when the land boom in California busted, the prices in Montana quickly followed.<br/>So for three years, the ranch just sat there.  A few ranchers still leased some grazing parcels.   And the mansion just sat, weathering the hot summers and cold winters without any upkeep.  Slowly and quietly, like the Niedermier family, fading from grandeur into disrepair.<br/>     Thus, the news that the ranch sold was very interesting to Meg and her friends, now assembled around the bonfire, eating hot dogs and hamburgers, blaring music on a boom box and enjoying the last bit of pre-school freedom.  <br/>     “My mom heard that the new ranch owners have kids, and one about our age,” said Melody, who was cuddling up close to Dashawn, as Riley watched enviously.  “Mom said they paid a fortune for it.  Much more than it was worth.  And that they are from California.”<br/>     “Aren’t they always from California?” said Riley with an uncharacteristically nasty tone in her voice, sending the message that Melody was a complete moron.<br/>     Dashawn jumped in to defend.  “Riley, I think Melody’s saying that they aren’t the typical Californians who just buy here because they can get a bigger place than in California.  This family is supposed to be really wealthy and famous – they could buy anywhere.  That’s what my Dad said.”<br/>     Meg could see Riley stiffen.  Imperceptible to anyone else, except her best friend.  “So who are they,” asked Riley.  “Anyone know?”<br/>     “Hey, maybe they are Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt! Wouldn’t that be cool?”  Grady laughed and snuggled closer to Gracie.<br/>      “Want another dog, Meggers?”  Devon was moving toward the fire, where some hot dogs were finishing up cooking.<br/>      “No, thanks.”  <br/>      “Anyone else?”  Meg was pleased that Devon asked her first.  Silly, I know, but maybe it means he thinks more about me.<br/>     Gracie leaned forward into the fire.  “Do you think all the, you know, bad luck stuff, will happen to the new family at the ranch?”  She shivered thinking about it.<br/>     “I wouldn’t want to live there,” Nae Nae said, shaking her head back and forth.  “Not after what happened…”<br/>     “Those are just stories.  Nothing is going to happen,” said Grady with his best bravura.<br/>     “I hope not.” Gracie looked down at her soda. “I wonder if there’ll be a kid in our grade?”<br/>     “Don’t know,” said Meg.  And for some reason, a shiver went down her spine as well.  She couldn’t put her finger on it.  But there seemed to be something off about this ranch sale.  Something odd.  Oh, it’s just because of all those ghost stories Mr. Maguire kept telling us.  But Meg had a hard time shaking this feeling of foreboding.  She looked at her cohorts laughing around the bonfire.  Even Riley had seemed to shake off her funk.  Maybe because Dashawn and Melody were actually making an effort to include her.  Devon and Grady were kidding around and Gracie seemed enthralled to be a part of this new group.  So then why am I feeling this odd feeling? thought Meg.  <br/>     Trey Walker’s truck was now coming up the road.  Nae Nae looked crushed.  It was clear she was enjoying being with the high school kids.  Riley look relieved.  Not much more to endure watching Dashawn and Melody.  Grady and Gracie started packing up, but did so, so they could have a few conspiratorial moments alone, using the guise of packing to conceal their real intent. Setting up another rendezvous, observed Meg.  I really hope this isn’t going to blow up for Grady.<br/>     She simply couldn’t shake the deep apprehension this bonfire party had stirred inside her.  She felt a concern for what was to become of them all this sophomore year.  And as it turns out, she was exactly right to feel that way.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
